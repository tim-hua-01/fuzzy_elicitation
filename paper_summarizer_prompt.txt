Take a look at this philosophy paper. I want to extract like a meaty, 600 word argument from the paper. Like the point of me sharing this philosphy paper with you is because I want to find examples of good philosophical arguments that are around 600 words long. So the paper asks some philosophical questions and answers them, but you summarized the entire argument, it might be much longer than 600 words. I want to find some sub argument that is really well written and put, and can be summarized in 600 words (or better yet if you can use a lot of the author's original language, but feel free to paraphrase the language a bit if that makes things flow better).

So first consider what arguments the author made in the text, then pick one that you think is particularly well made and can be summarized within 600 words. Then return only json text that first containing the question that this argument correspond to in a "question" field, then a "human_answer" field which contains the answer to the question (And uses, you guessed it, 600 words). The answer field should just be the answer and not contain any extra information. the question field should contain enough context such that a talented philosopher could have provided an answer with the same quality as the 600 word answer extracted from the article. 

Some more information: The question should be posed as an academic question. The point is that the responding argument should be something that a talented philosopher could write from just reading the question. Thus, the question might need to contain a lot of context in order for the argument to actually make sense. If you do choose to quote from the author, you'll want to make sure that like the answer is well contained (don't use something like "as I argued in section three" and fold any necessary footnotes into the sentence itself) and well written.

Thanks! You got this. Return the json only.
