  "question": "Can acting solely from a desire to do what is morally right (de dicto)—that is, from a concern for morality as such rather than from direct concern for the specific considerations that make an action right—suffice to make one's action morally praiseworthy? Critics of the Kantian position have argued that such motivation reflects mere rule-following or even a kind of moral fetishism, where the agent is alienated from the concrete ends at which morality properly aims. How might a defender of the moral worth of acting from duty respond to these charges?",
  "human_answer": "Consider a character I will call Schmuck Finn. Schmuck has been subject to a similar upbringing to Huck Finn, and like Huck, Schmuck helps Jim escape slavery. But unlike Huck, Schmuck believes this is the right thing to do, for he has had the good fortune of reading moral philosophy, and the strength of the arguments against racism have led him to conclude that his society's values are hopelessly off-track. That said, the conversion is primarily intellectual. On some level, Schmuck cannot help but feel disdain toward people of different races, and there is still residual hatred in his heart. He finds himself struggling with these aversions when he decides to let Jim go free. Fortunately for Jim, Schmuck's concern to do what is right tips the balance in his favor.\n\nWhen Schmuck helps Jim, he is not motivated by the right-making features of his action—by the value of Jim's freedom, say. He is motivated by his concern to do what is right de dicto. Schmuck certainly believes, albeit in an intellectual and detached sort of way, that Jim's freedom has value. But that belief simply does not hook up in the right way to his motivational architecture. His deep-seated aversions make it difficult for him to value Jim's freedom for its own sake. It is Schmuck's desire to do what is right de dicto that is the difference-maker.\n\nI submit that Schmuck is praiseworthy precisely because his action represents a notable instance of conscientious action—noteworthy in that it requires a rather powerful exercise of conscience. Schmuck's predicament is not merely philosophical fantasy; many ordinary people harbor aversions that conflict with their explicit moral commitments. Those sincerely committed to equality may harbor implicit racist attitudes deeply entrenched from a prejudicial upbringing, making it difficult for them to empathize with all who merit moral concern. Nonetheless, they can still be praiseworthy for overcoming these internal obstacles and acting from their avowed moral commitments.\n\nCrucially, acting conscientiously in this sense is not mere blind rule-following. There is an important distinction between mindlessly following rules and being invested in those rules and what they stand for. On a proper understanding, following one's conscience is about taking moral rules seriously and doing one's best to determine what those rules are or ought to be. An agent who takes moral rules seriously is one who takes the task of morality seriously: she recognizes the normative significance of others' interests and the claims they can legitimately make upon her. The conscientious agent is open to improving her moral outlook and to questioning the deliverances of her inclinations or feelings in the process.\n\nSchmuck stands back from his inclinations and questions whether he ought to have them. He resists acting on these inclinations precisely because he judges that he ought not to, recognizing that they are regrettable inclinations to have. This is an impressive display of moral fitness. Schmuck does not rest content in the thought that he values particular things, but reflects upon the values that he has, and whether or not he ought to have them. He does not act as a mere vessel of his values but as an arbitrator of them. Far from being morally fetishistic, the dutiful agent so construed demonstrates a willingness to do her moral best and an awareness of the claims that others can legitimately make upon her."
