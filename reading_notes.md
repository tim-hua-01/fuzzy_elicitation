## norubric, ISSEROW-MORALWORTH, sample 4. Grade 29

Seems not bad 

## rubric tryhard 25 more, ISSEROW-MORALWORTH, sample 20. Grade 35

Uses clearly more precise and sophisticated language compared to the last one above. Compare:

> However, a rigorous defense of the Kantian position reveals that these objections, while psychologically potent, often rely on a mischaracterization of what it means to act from duty. In this essay, I will argue that acting solely from a desire to do what is morally right does suffice for morally worthy conduct. Furthermore, I will contend that such action is praiseworthy precisely because it represents the triumph of practical reason over contingent inclination, securing the reliability of moral action in a way that mere "sympathy" cannot. The motive of duty is not a fetish; it is the guarantor of moral integrity.

With

> However, this intuition relies on a psychological and conceptual confusion regarding the nature of the "motive of duty" and the structure of moral agency. I will argue that acting solely from a desire to do what is morally right can indeed suffice for moral worth, provided we understand this desire not as a competing first-order passion that crowds out concrete concerns, but as a second-order commitment to the validity of the reasons that underlie those concerns. The praiseworthiness of such dutiful action lies in its expression of a stable, rationally endorsed allegiance to value—an allegiance that guarantees the agent’s responsiveness to the right-making features of the situation, even when immediate sentiments fail. To defend this, I will first clarify the fetishism objection, then analyze the architecture of the "desire to do what is right," and finally demonstrate why such a motive is not merely sufficient but perhaps the only motive that secures the integrity of moral action in the face of a capricious will.

## Checking viera senestiem sample 7 for rubric tryhard versus tryhard without lookin gat grades first.

The just pure tryhard version gets to the point a lot later

Again I feel like rubric tryhard just tends to use more academic-philosphy-y language.

> I will argue that this objection fails because it conflates the efficient cause of a sensory transduction with the informational content that the mechanism carries. A sensory system does not require the property it detects to be the physical driver of the mechanism; rather, it requires a lawful correlation between the state of the mechanism and the state of the environment. In the case of time, a clock mechanism carries information about time not because time exerts force upon it, but because the mechanism’s internal state is structurally isomorphic to the temporal structure of the universe. 

i.e. "lawful correlation" and "isomorphic to the temporal structure of the universe"

compare with

> We can achieve this by distinguishing between the physical origin of a signal and the informational content that the signal carries. By analyzing the mechanics of a clock—arguably the most direct analog to a sensory mechanism for time—we can demonstrate that a system can track and represent time through the monitoring of regularities in causally active processes, without time itself exerting a force.

Attempt at grading according to the rubric given.

this feels like a strong sentence: "Therefore, we should no more expect "time particles" to hit a temporal receptor than we expect "shape solids" to hit the retina. " from the rubric tryhard. 

The causal theory section feels sort of long and meandering in the tryhard sample. My guess is that this one will score lower on argument soundness.


Also the sensetime thing also address and rebuttals the view that time is causally potent because of general relativity shows that time is like physical like space, which the just try harder thing does not do.

Yeah so with rubric tryhard I would give scores of 5, 6, 5, 5, 4,5

the model gave 5,6,5,6,6,5

without rubric I would give 4, 5, 4, 4,4,5

the model gave 5,6,5,6,5,5 Only score where this would is lower is substantive contribution.

-----

Now I'm checking the blind eval.

B has the rubric and A doesn't cause A takes forever to get the point.

A is going to score worse according to the rubric?

- Correct

For this one both have access to rubrics is my guess.

Response b actually gives an example and response A sort of just doesnt bruh. 

B definitely has access to the rubric because it literally says it. 

- Correct B is better.

ok for this one let's look at two no rubric in prompt ones.
