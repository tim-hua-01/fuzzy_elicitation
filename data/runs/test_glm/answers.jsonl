{"question_id": "Builes-ParadoxEvidentialEquivalence-2020", "question": "Consider the following case: You are in a room with a countable infinity of people, and each of you flips a fair coin without looking at the result. You know that all the coin flips are fair and independent. You are then informed that something remarkable happened: only finitely many coins landed heads. What should your credence be that your coin landed heads? Should it remain at 1/2, or should it change? Provide arguments for your answer.", "answer": "This puzzle presents a fascinating conflict between our intuitions about statistical frequencies and the rigorous application of probability theory to infinite sets. The scenario forces us to confront how we update credences when receiving evidence that is logically possible yet has a prior probability of zero. After considering the symmetry of the situation and the nature of the evidence, I argue that your credence that your coin landed heads should remain at 1/2.\n\nThe immediate hurdle is mathematical: the event that \"only finitely many coins land heads\" constitutes a set of outcomes with measure zero under the standard product measure (the Lebesgue measure) on the space of infinite coin flips. In standard Bayesian epistemology, conditionalization on an event of probability zero is undefined; the ratio $P(H|E) = P(H \\cap E) / P(E)$ involves division by zero. Consequently, we cannot rely on the mechanical application of Bayes\u2019 rule. Instead, we must rely on deeper principles of symmetry and indifference.\n\nThe strongest argument for retaining a credence of 1/2 rests on the independence of the coin flips and the symmetry between the agents. Each person in the room is in an epistemically identical position: each flipped a fair coin, and each has access to the same global information. There is no indexical information\u2014such as \"I am the first person in the room\" or \"I am sitting in the blue chair\"\u2014that distinguishes one agent from another regarding the likelihood of their coin landing heads.\n\nThe evidence that \"only finitely many coins landed heads\" is a *global* structural fact about the aggregate sequence, whereas your specific coin flip is a *local* event. In probability theory, an event like \"finitely many heads\" is what is known as a \"tail event.\" By Kolmogorov\u2019s Zero-One Law, such events are effectively independent of any finite subset of coin flips. While we cannot strictly speak of independence when an event has zero probability, the philosophical insight remains: the behavior of the infinite tail of the sequence does not exert a \"probabilistic force\" on any specific, finite coin flip.\n\nOne might object that if only finitely many heads exist among an infinity of tails, the \"density\" of heads is effectively zero. Therefore, shouldn't you conclude you are almost certainly a tail? This objection mistakes the lack of a uniform probability distribution over the countably infinite agents for information about your specific coin. You are not selecting a person at random from the infinite set of people; you *are* a specific agent whose outcome was determined by a local physical process with a chance of 1/2. The global information informs you that the total number of heads is bounded, but it provides no discriminating evidence that suggests *your* specific trial was one of the successes rather than the failures.\n\nIf you were to lower your credence below 1/2, you would be claiming that the evidence \"finitely many heads\" provides specific support for the proposition \"my coin is tails.\" But the evidence supports \"my coin is tails\" only insofar as it supports the proposition \"everyone\u2019s coin is tails\" eventually. However, it remains consistent with the evidence that *your* coin is the one and only head. Since the evidence does not discriminate between you and any other agent, the Principle of Indifference dictates that your credence must remain uniform. Therefore, despite the surprising nature of the news, your credence should stay at 1/2.", "model": "openrouter/z-ai/glm-4.7", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric", "sample_idx": 0, "is_human": false}
{"question_id": "Enoch-FalseConsciousnessLiberals-2020", "question": "What makes adaptive preferences\u2014preferences shaped in response to constraints on one's feasible options\u2014less than fully autonomous? Consider whether subjectivist accounts (such as Frankfurt's hierarchical model of desire endorsement), content-based accounts (which evaluate the moral quality of what is preferred), or historical accounts (which examine how the preference was formed) best explain the autonomy deficit that adaptive preferences seem to exhibit, particularly in cases of oppression.", "answer": "The phenomenon of adaptive preferences\u2014where individuals adjust their desires to match the limitations of their oppressive circumstances\u2014poses a significant challenge to theories of personal autonomy. When a person who is systematically denied education claims they \"never wanted to learn anyway,\" or when a victim of abuse rationalizes their suffering as love, we intuitively sense a deficit in their autonomy. To understand this deficit, we must evaluate whether the failure lies in the structure of the will (subjectivism), the substance of the desire (content), or the story of its creation (history). While subjectivist accounts offer a compelling internal model of the self, and content-based accounts protect against harmful choices, it is the historical approach that most accurately explains why adaptive preferences fail to be autonomous.\n\nSubjectivist accounts, most notably Harry Frankfurt\u2019s hierarchical model, posit that an agent is autonomous when their first-order desires (to do X) align with their second-order volitions (to want to want X). The appeal here is the emphasis on internal coherence. However, this model struggles to account for the autonomy deficit in adaptive preferences. The tragedy of adaptive preference formation is often that the oppression is so thoroughgoing it colonizes the second-order volitions as well. If the oppressed person identifies entirely with their subservient role\u2014endorsing their desire to obey the oppressor\u2014Frankfurt\u2019s model classifies this as autonomous. Because subjectivism is historically blind, viewing the agent as a snapshot in time, it cannot distinguish between a preference that is freely endorsed and one that is warped to fit a cage.\n\nContent-based accounts, such as those advocated by Martha Nussbaum, attempt to solve this by evaluating the moral quality or the \"objective worth\" of the preferences. Nussbaum argues that for a preference to be autonomous, it must be formed amidst adequate options and informed by a understanding of human flourishing. While this captures the tragedy of adaptive preferences\u2014often described as \"deformed desires\"\u2014it risks conflating autonomy with wisdom or morality. A person might autonomously choose a morally questionable or self-sacrificial path without being oppressed. By focusing on what is chosen, content-based accounts can become overly paternalistic, dismissing the desires of the oppressed simply because they do not align with a normative list of the \"good life,\" rather than because the mechanism of choice was compromised.\n\nThis leads to the strength of the historical account. Philosophers like Marina Oshana and Diana Meyers argue that autonomy is fundamentally a matter of procedural history. On this view, a preference is non-autonomous not because of what it is, but because of how it was formed. Adaptive preferences are typically the product of \"oppressive socialization,\" where external constraints systematically diminish an agent\u2019s capacity for critical reflection and self-discovery. The autonomy deficit lies in the absence of \"options awareness\" and the coercive narrowing of the opportunity horizon. The agent did not simply choose X; they were sculpted by a system that eliminated Y and Z, thereby warping the deliberative process itself.\n\nUltimately, the historical account provides the most robust explanation. It respects the internal state of the agent\u2014acknowledging they may feel \"satisfied\"\u2014while indicting the environment that manufactured that satisfaction. It recognizes that the problem with adaptive preferences is not merely that the oppressed want the \"wrong\" things, but that the world has stolen their freedom to define themselves independently of their constraints.", "model": "openrouter/z-ai/glm-4.7", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric", "sample_idx": 0, "is_human": false}
{"question_id": "Franzn-EvaluativeDiscourseAffective-2020", "question": "In English, the verb 'find' (as in 'Holmes finds Saltimbocca tasty' or 'She finds lying wrong') is a 'subjective attitude verb' that only allows certain predicates to embed under it\u2014evaluative predicates like 'tasty,' 'cruel,' and 'beautiful' embed felicitously, while purely descriptive predicates like 'vegetarian' or 'made of pasta' do not. Expressivists about evaluative discourse maintain that evaluative statements express non-cognitive attitudes in the same way that ordinary descriptive statements express beliefs. If it could be shown that 'find' states are non-cognitive in nature, this would provide linguistic support for expressivism, since evaluative assertions combined with denials of being in the corresponding 'find' state produce Moorean infelicity (e.g., '??It is wrong to eat meat but I don't find it wrong'). What evidence supports the thesis that the mental states attributed by 'find'-constructions are non-cognitive and specifically affective in nature, belonging to the same category as states like appreciating, loving, hating, and detesting?", "answer": "The contention that the mental states reported by \"find\"-constructions are non-cognitive and affective finds robust support in three interconnected domains: the direction of fit of the attributed state, the semantic constraints on permissible predicates, and the specific logic of the Moorean infelicity inherent in their denial.\n\nFirst, consider the conative nature\u2014the \"direction of fit\"\u2014of the state attributed by \"find.\" Standard cognitive states, such as beliefs, possess a mind-to-world direction of fit; they aim to represent how the world is. In contrast, the states attributed by \"find\" exhibit a world-to-mind direction of fit, characteristic of desires and emotions. When one reports, \"Holmes finds Saltimbocca tasty,\" one is not merely describing a gustatory property of the dish, but rather attributing to Holmes a disposition of favor, a pro-attitude that inclines him toward consumption. Similarly, to say one finds lying wrong is to attribute a stance of aversion or condemnation, not merely a recognition of a deontic fact. This alignment with the motivational force of non-cognitive states places \"find\" in the same semantic category as verbs like \"love\" or \"hate.\" We cannot meaningfully say \"He loves the painting but is completely indifferent to it,\" yet we can say \"He believes the painting is valuable but is indifferent to it.\" The necessary connection between \"finding\" and a motivated orientation toward the object suggests an affective rather than a merely doxastic state.\n\nSecond, the linguistic evidence of semantic selectivity strongly implies an affective basis. As noted, \"find\" resists purely descriptive predicates. One cannot felicitously say, \"I find this dish vegetarian\" or \"She finds the table made of oak.\" The failure of these constructions is not merely grammatical but conceptual. The verb \"find\" in this subjective sense does not function as a verb of discovery (as in \"I find the wallet\"), but as a report of a *valuation*. Descriptive predicates like \"vegetarian\" or \"oak\" lack the requisite valence to serve as objects of an affective attitude. One cannot have an affective pro- or con-attitude toward a piece of wood merely being oak in the same way one does toward it being beautiful or ugly. The fact that \"find\" accepts only evaluative predicates suggests that the state it reports is structurally attuned to affect, requiring a predicate that is capable of being the target of approval or disapproval.\n\nFinally, the Moorean infelicity of the denial\u2014\"It is wrong, but I don't find it wrong\"\u2014provides crucial logical evidence. The absurdity here mirrors the classic Moorean paradox (\"It is raining, but I don't believe it is raining\"), implying that the assertion \"It is wrong\" logically commits the speaker to being in the \"finding\" state. For the expressivist, the assertion of a moral claim functions precisely to express that affective state. Therefore, to assert the claim and simultaneously deny possessing the corresponding affective state is to assert something while immediately undermining the pragmatic force that gives the assertion its meaning. This deep pragmatic dissonance confirms that the \"find\" state is not an accidental accompaniment to the judgment but is constitutive of it.\n\nIn sum, the evidence suggests that \"find\"-constructions do not attribute cold, cognitive appraisals, but rather map the world of values onto the emotional and conative architecture of the agent. By linking evaluation directly to affective response, these verbs provide a linguistic microcosm of the expressivist thesis: that ethical discourse is fundamentally an expression of our non-cognitive attitudes.", "model": "openrouter/z-ai/glm-4.7", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric", "sample_idx": 0, "is_human": false}
{"question_id": "GALLOW-CAUSALDECISIONTHEORISTS-2020", "question": "Causal Decision Theory (CDT) evaluates acts by their expected utility, calculated using unconditional probabilities for states not causally downstream of your act. In 'Death in Damascus'-style cases, where you must choose between going to Aleppo or Damascus knowing that Death awaits in whichever city he predicted you would visit (with predictions being reliable but imperfect, and Death having a tendency to guess Damascus), the utility of each act depends on your current probability that you will perform that act. This means CDT's recommendations can shift as your act probabilities change during deliberation. Is this dependence on act probabilities a problem for CDT, and if so, why?", "answer": "The dependence of Causal Decision Theory (CDT) on act probabilities in \"Death in Damascus\" cases reveals a profound and arguably fatal instability in its practical application as a normative guide for deliberation. While CDT is philosophically robust in its insistence that an agent should only care about the causal consequences of their actions, its reliance on the agent's current credence in their own future actions creates a dynamic \"signpost\" problem: the theory's recommendations shift as the agent moves towards a decision, potentially vanishing entirely at the moment of choice. This is a problem because it violates the fundamental requirement that a decision theory provide a stable foundation for action, rather than a moving target that paralyzes the will.\n\nTo understand the gravity of this, we must look closely at the mechanics of the dilemma. In these cases, Death\u2019s location is correlated with your choice via a prediction, but it is not causally influenced by it. Therefore, CDT evaluates acts using unconditional probabilities of the states. However, because Death\u2019s location depends on a prediction of your action, the unconditional probability that Death is in Damascus is effectively equivalent to the probability that you will go to Damascus (adjusted for Death's reliability). Consequently, the expected utility of going to Aleppo is a function of your current credence that you will actually go to Aleppo.\n\nThis creates a dynamic instability. Suppose you initially have a slight credence that you will go to Aleppo. CDT might calculate that Aleppo is the safer bet, recommending it. However, once you receive this recommendation, your credence in going to Aleppo rises. As your credence rises, so does the probability that Death predicted this and is waiting in Aleppo. The expected utility of Aleppo then drops, potentially making Damascus the superior option. As you pivot towards Damascus, the logic reverses again.\n\nThe problem here is not merely that the world is tricky, but that CDT fails to provide a stable point of rationality. A decision theory should ideally guide the agent from a state of indecision to a state of resolution. CDT, in these scenarios, acts like a mirage: the closer you get to the act it recommends, the further away the recommendation moves. This leads to a cycle of indecision where the agent cannot rationally settle on any act, because every time they attempt to form an intention, the utility calculus undercuts that very intention.\n\nFurthermore, this dependence undermines the concept of \"ratifiability,\" a condition often added to CDT to stabilize choices. An act is ratifiable only if, upon learning that you will perform it, it still appears optimal. In Death in Damascus, no act may be ratifiable, or acts may only be ratifiable at specific, arbitrary credence levels. If a theory cannot tell you what to do independent of your prior inclination to do it, it ceases to function as a guide. It tells you only that you should do what you are going to do, provided you are going to do it. This is circular and unhelpful for an agent in the throes of deliberation.\n\nUltimately, this dependence on act probabilities exposes a gap in the Causal view of agency. CDT treats the agent\u2019s decision as an event external to the calculation, ignoring the fact that the *process* of deciding changes the parameters of the calculation. A satisfactory decision theory must account for the dynamics of deliberation, offering a fixed recommendation that survives the agent's adoption of it. By failing to do so, CDT risks leaving the rational agent stranded in an infinite loop of second-guessing, unable to act even when action is desperately required.", "model": "openrouter/z-ai/glm-4.7", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric", "sample_idx": 0, "is_human": false}
{"question_id": "ISSEROW-MORALWORTH-2020", "question": "Many philosophers have argued that the motive of duty\u2014understood as a de dicto desire to do what is morally right\u2014cannot suffice for moral worth. On their view, praiseworthy agents must be motivated by the concrete considerations that explain why their actions are right (such as concern for others' welfare), rather than by an abstract concern for morality as such. Critics charge that agents motivated solely by duty exhibit a kind of moral fetishism or alienation from what morality is really about. Can acting solely from a desire to do what is morally right suffice as a motive for morally worthy conduct? If so, what makes such dutiful action praiseworthy?", "answer": "The critique of the motive of duty\u2014specifically the charge that it constitutes \"moral fetishism\"\u2014rests on the intuition that morality is essentially concerned with the concrete well-being of persons, rather than the abstract satisfaction of a principle. Critics like Michael Stocker argue that if a doctor visits a patient solely because it is her \"duty,\" rather than because she cares for the patient, she exhibits a disturbing \"schizophrenia\" of modern moral theory. She values the *rightness* of the action more than the *person* the action is meant to help. However, while this critique highlights a psychological deficit in a life devoid of sympathy, it fails to undermine the claim that the motive of duty suffices for moral worth. In fact, acting solely from the desire to do what is right represents the highest form of moral praiseworthiness precisely because it secures the reliability and universality of ethical action.\n\nTo understand why the motive of duty is sufficient, we must distinguish between the *explanatory* reason for an action\u2019s rightness and the *motivating* reason of the agent. It is true that the rightness of an action is usually grounded in concrete features\u2014such as the relief of suffering or the respect for a promise. However, the motive of duty is not necessarily blind to these features. Rather, the agent who acts from duty recognizes that these concrete features generate a moral obligation, and they choose the action *because* it is obligatory. The \"fetishist\" objection applies only if one views the principle of morality as a detached sticker applied arbitrarily to actions. But if the agent correctly identifies that helping a friend is what morality *requires* in this context, then acting from that determination is not alienation; it is the prioritization of the objective value of the relationship over the agent\u2019s fluctuating emotional state.\n\nWhat makes such dutiful action praiseworthy is the capacity for self-governance it demonstrates. When we act from inclination\u2014such as sympathy or benevolence\u2014we are, in a sense,\u88ab\u52a8 passengers of our own psychology. We do good because it feels good. While such actions are amiable, they lack the distinctively moral dimension of agency. Praise is typically reserved for effort and difficulty, not for the effortless following of natural impulses. An agent who acts from duty, especially when their inclinations urge them toward indifference or self-interest, exerts their autonomy. They align their will with the rational order of the world. This triumph of reason over inclination is the essence of moral virtue.\n\nFurthermore, the motive of duty is the only motive that guarantees the *reliability* of moral action. Inclinations are fickle; sympathy can be exhausted by fatigue, and love can be obscured by anger. If moral worth depended entirely on these contingent states, our commitment to others would be precarious. The agent who acts from a de dicto desire to do right acts on a maxim that can be universally willed. This agent ensures that the right thing will be done even when the emotional \"music\" has stopped. Therefore, far from being a fetishistic obsession with rules, the motive of duty represents a steadfast commitment to the value of others that is independent of the agent\u2019s variable moods. It is this unconditional commitment\u2014the willingness to serve the moral law even, and especially, when it does not suit us\u2014that constitutes the profoundest ground for praise.", "model": "openrouter/z-ai/glm-4.7", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric", "sample_idx": 0, "is_human": false}
{"question_id": "Jenkin-EpistemicRoleCore-2020", "question": "Some philosophers argue that in order for a mental state to be based on epistemic reasons (and thereby have an epistemic status as justified or unjustified), the subject must be consciously aware of those reasons. This poses a challenge for views that hold that modular, automatic cognitive processes can involve genuine epistemic basing. Does lack of conscious awareness of one's reasons preclude a mental state from being epistemically based on those reasons?", "answer": "The question of whether conscious awareness is a prerequisite for the epistemic basing relation strikes at the heart of the dispute between internalism and externalism in epistemology. The \"basing relation\" is the metaphysical glue that connects a reason to a belief; it distinguishes a belief that is *held because of* a reason from a belief that is merely *caused* by a reason (e.g., a belief caused by a headache which happens to be true). While the intuition that justification requires a conscious perspective on one's reasons is compelling, I argue that lack of conscious awareness does not preclude epistemic basing. To require consciousness for basing would effectively deny epistemic status to the vast majority of our cognitive lives, particularly our perceptual and modular interactions with the world.\n\nThe internalist argument for consciousness relies on a deontological conception of justification. If a subject is to be praiseworthy or rational for holding a belief, they must have the ability to access and scrutinize the grounds for that belief. On this view, \"basing\" is a reflective act: the subject must consciously \"take\" the evidence to support the conclusion. If a cognitive process operates automatically and sub-personally, the subject lacks the perspective to endorse the connection, and thus, the mental state lacks a genuine epistemic basis.\n\nHowever, this view faces a formidable objection in the form of perceptual knowledge. Consider a subject who, upon looking at a tree, immediately forms the belief that there is a tree. This process is modular, fast, and automatic. The subject is not consciously aware of the proximal stimuli, the retinal activation, or the complex neural processing that serves as the reasons for the belief. Furthermore, the subject is not conscious of the *inference* from sensory input to visual belief. If we accept the internalist constraint, the subject is not consciously aware of their reasons, and thus, their belief is not based on those reasons. Consequently, the belief is not justified in the epistemic sense. This leads to an untenable skepticism; we are forced to conclude that ordinary perceptual beliefs are unjustified because the machinery of perception is hidden from view.\n\nTo avoid this absurdity, we must adopt a more permissive account of basing, such as a causal or dispositional theory. On a causal account, a belief is based on a reason if the reason plays an appropriate causal role in the production and sustainment of the belief. In the case of modular processes, the sensory inputs causally sustain the perceptual belief in the right way. The fact that this causation occurs below the threshold of consciousness does not negate its status as a basing relation; it merely describes the *mechanism* of the relation.\n\nFurthermore, we can appeal to a notion of \"dispositional basing.\" A subject may not be consciously considering their evidence at time $t$, but if they were challenged, they would appeal to that very evidence to defend their belief. The structure of their cognitive system is such that the evidence is available to influence the belief, even if it is not currently illuminated by the spotlight of attention. The modular system is not a rogue agent; it is a constitutive part of the subject\u2019s cognitive architecture. Therefore, the reasons processed by these modules belong to the subject, not to a disconnected homunculus.\n\nIn conclusion, requiring conscious awareness for epistemic basing conflates the *condition* for justification with the *mechanism* of justification. While conscious deliberation represents the paradigm of explicit reasoning, it is not the only path to epistemic legitimacy. By accepting a causal or dispositional account of basing, we can acknowledge that automatic, modular processes provide a genuine epistemic foundation for our beliefs, preserving the justification of our everyday engagement with the world.", "model": "openrouter/z-ai/glm-4.7", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric", "sample_idx": 0, "is_human": false}
{"question_id": "Koskinen-DefendingRiskAccount-2020", "question": "Several philosophers of science, including Arthur Fine and Heather Douglas, have suggested that the various applicable senses of scientific objectivity (such as procedural objectivity, convergent objectivity, and interactive objectivity) share a common basis in trust\u2014that when we call something objective, we indicate that it can be trusted. However, this characterization seems imprecise. What is the actual relationship between scientific objectivity and trust, and can we provide a more precise account of what unifies the different senses of objectivity?", "answer": "The proposal advanced by Arthur Fine and Heather Douglas\u2014that scientific objectivity is best understood as a mark of trustworthiness\u2014captures a vital sociological and pragmatic truth. When we designate a scientific finding as \"objective,\" we are indeed issuing a warrant for reliance, signaling that the claim is robust enough to serve as a basis for policy, further research, or public belief. However, equating objectivity directly with trust risks conflating the *epistemic status* of a claim with the *attitude* of the inquirer. To say that objectivity *is* trust is imprecise because trust is a relational attitude we adopt toward agents or instruments, whereas objectivity is a property of a process or result. The relationship is not one of identity, but of grounding: objectivity constitutes the structural grounds that warrant trust. To unify the various senses of objectivity\u2014procedural, convergent, and interactive\u2014we must look past the feeling of trust to the underlying condition of **independence from individual will**.\n\nThe imprecision of the \"trust\" definition becomes apparent when we consider that we frequently trust things that are decidedly not objective. We trust a close friend to give us good advice, but their advice is inherently subjective, rooted in their specific perspective and affection for us. Conversely, we might acknowledge a mathematical truth or a historical fact as objective without necessarily feeling a deep sense of \"trust\" in the emotional sense; we simply recognize its necessity. Therefore, trust cannot be the defining essence of objectivity, though it is a primary consequence.\n\nTo provide a more precise unifying account, we must examine the shared structure of the senses mentioned. Procedural objectivity relies on standardized methods to prevent individual bias from influencing the outcome. Convergent objectivity (often associated with robustness) gains its force from the fact that multiple independent lines of inquiry or different researchers arrive at the same result. Interactive objectivity, as described by Helen Longino and relevant to Douglas\u2019s work, relies on critical social dialogue to transform individual subjective perspectives into a consensus that transcends any single viewpoint.\n\nWhat unifies these disparate senses is the systematic **exclusion of the idiosyncratic subject**. In each case, the mechanism of objectivity functions as a filter or a buffer designed to ensure that the final output is not merely a reflection of the researcher\u2019s personal preferences, location, or limited vantage point. Whether through the rigid adherence to a method (procedural), the triangulation of different perspectives (convergent), or the critical friction of a community (interactive), the unifying principle is the detachment of the claim from the specific contingencies of the individual knower.\n\nTherefore, the relationship between objectivity and trust is one of *justification*. Objectivity is the state of a claim or process being perspective-independent; trust is the rational response of a community to that independence. We trust objective science not because we have a social contract to do so, but because the processes involved are designed to ignore the specific desires of the scientists conducting them. Objectivity is the machinery that aligns belief with a reality that is indifferent to us. By defining objectivity as \"perspective-independence\" or the \"transcendence of the individual will,\" we retain the valuable link to reliability highlighted by Fine and Douglas, but we provide the rigorous conceptual architecture needed to distinguish scientific truth from mere social reliability.", "model": "openrouter/z-ai/glm-4.7", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric", "sample_idx": 0, "is_human": false}
{"question_id": "Maguire-GameBelief-2020", "question": "Some philosophers argue that there are both epistemic reasons (evidence-based) and practical reasons (concerning usefulness, harm, or moral considerations) that bear on what we ought to believe. However, these two types of reasons seem fundamentally different in kind\u2014epistemic reasons concern truth-conduciveness while practical reasons concern value or welfare. If both types of reasons genuinely bear on belief, how can they possibly interact to determine what one ought to believe, given that they seem incommensurable and thus impossible to weigh against each other directly?", "answer": "The tension between epistemic and practical reasons constitutes one of the most persistent puzzles in the epistemology of normativity. On the surface, the chasm appears unbridgeable: epistemic reasons are essentially truth-conducive, demanding that we align our minds with the world, while practical reasons are welfare-conducive, demanding that we manipulate the world (or our position within it) to serve our ends. To suggest that we can \"weigh\" truth against happiness seems to entail a category error, akin to asking whether the color blue is heavier than the sound of a cello.\n\nHowever, to resolve this apparent incommensurability, we must refine our understanding of what it means for these reasons to \"interact.\" I propose that the interaction is best understood not as a direct exchange of distinct currencies, but as a hierarchical structuring of agency, where practical considerations function to set the *stakes* that determine the stringency of the epistemic standard.\n\nFirst, we must distinguish between the \"epistemic ought\" and the \"all-things-considered ought.\" The epistemic \"ought\" operates within a closed system where truth is the sole intrinsic good. Within this sphere, practical reasons are indeed irrelevant. But agents are not purely epistemic engines; they are embodied actors navigating a world of consequences. The \"all-things-considered\" judgment must account for the totality of the agent's practical existence. The question, then, is not \"How many units of truth equal one unit of safety?\" but rather \"Given my practical goals, what is the appropriate level of epistemic vigilance?\"\n\nThis leads to the mechanism of interaction: pragmatic encroachment. Here, practical reasons do not compete with evidence as *reasons for belief* in the direct sense; rather, they determine how much evidence is required. Imagine a diagnosis. In a low-stakes scenario (e.g., betting on a trivia game), a modest probability suffices to justify believing a proposition. In a high-stakes scenario (e.g., a medical diagnosis requiring risky surgery), the same probability is epistemically insufficient. The practical stakes (the potential for harm) do not provide evidence for the diagnosis, but they raise the epistemic threshold for permissible belief.\n\nHowever, one might object that this merely delays the problem: what happens when the stakes are so high that one ought to believe contrary to the evidence to survive (Pascal\u2019s Wager scenarios)? Here, we must acknowledge that while incommensurable in nature, reasons are commensurable in the currency of *rational agency*. We weigh the disvalue of violating the constitutive norms of belief (dishonesty to oneself) against the disvalue of the practical outcome (harm). When we say we \"weigh\" these, we are engaging in a second-order deliberation about what kind of agent we ought to be.\n\nUltimately, the interaction is possible because the norms of belief are instrumental to the life of a practical agent. We generally prioritize truth because it is the most reliable map for navigating reality. Therefore, we adopt a default lexical priority for epistemic reasons: we ignore practical reasons *unless* the practical cost is catastrophic. This creates a structured interaction where practical reasons act as a veto power or a threshold adjuster, rather than a counter-weight in a simple scale. By viewing the agent as a unity whose cognitive faculties are subservient to their practical flourishing, we can see how the two distinct types of reasons combine to guide belief without requiring a common metric of value.", "model": "openrouter/z-ai/glm-4.7", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric", "sample_idx": 0, "is_human": false}
{"question_id": "Smortchkova-SeeingGoalDirectedness-2020", "question": "Some philosophers and cognitive scientists have argued that motor resonance\u2014the mapping of another's action onto one's own motor repertoire\u2014is a necessary condition for perceiving goal-directed actions. On this view, one is able to perceive others' goal-directed actions only to the extent that one is able to simulate them with one's own motor system. Is motor resonance necessary for the perception of goal-directed actions, or can goal-directed actions be perceived independently of resonance mechanisms?", "answer": "The claim that motor resonance is a necessary condition for perceiving goal-directed actions is a central tenet of the \"Simulation Theory\" of social cognition, often grounded in the discovery of the mirror neuron system. According to this view, to understand an action is not to interpret it like a visual scene, but to virtually enact it within one\u2019s own motor repertoire. However, upon closer examination, the necessity of motor resonance appears philosophically tenuous and empirically brittle. I argue that while motor resonance provides a powerful *mechanism* for social understanding, it is not a *necessary condition*; goal-directed actions can be perceived independently of resonance through purely visual-spatiotemporal analysis and inferential reasoning.\n\nThe primary argument against the necessity of motor resonance emerges from alternative accounts of action perception, most notably the \"Teleological Stance\" proposed by Gergely and Csibra. This view argues that goal attribution is essentially a rational inference process based on the perception of efficiency. An observer perceives an action as goal-directed by analyzing the relationship between the movement, the environmental constraints, and the target state. For instance, if one observes an agent taking a circuitous path to an object only when a direct path is obstructed, the action is perceived as goal-directed because it is the most rational means to the end given the circumstances. This form of perception relies on a sophisticated, albeit amodal, computation of physical and rational constraints. It does not require the observer to map the observed movement onto their own motor neurons; it requires only a visual parser that detects geometry and obstacle avoidance. Consequently, the visual system itself seems capable of generating the representation of a \"goal\" without recruiting the motor system.\n\nFurthermore, empirical dissociations between motor competence and action comprehension challenge the necessity claim. If motor resonance were strictly necessary, then impairments to the motor system should result in a corresponding deficit in perceiving goals. Yet, patients with severe motor deficits or even limb amputations\u2014individuals who lack the specific motor repertoire to simulate certain actions\u2014still retain the ability to perceive and understand the goals of those actions. While proponents of the strong simulation view might argue that congenital deficits differ from acquired ones, the persistence of goal perception in the absence of motor capability suggests a functional independence. The cognitive architecture for interpreting others seems to rely on abstract representations of agency and intentionality that are distinct from the concrete mappings of the motor cortex.\n\nHowever, to deny the necessity of resonance is not to deny its significance. Motor resonance likely serves as a *heuristic shortcut* that allows for rapid, pre-reflective prediction and empathy. It bridges the gap between self and other, allowing us to \"feel\" the action rather than merely calculating it. Yet, a heuristic is not a prerequisite. Just as a computer can solve a chess problem without \"feeling\" the tension of the game, the human visual system can parse the rational structure of an action without the somatic marker of motor resonance.\n\nIn conclusion, motor resonance is best understood as a sufficient, but not necessary, mechanism for the perception of goal-directed actions. The teleological interpretation of visual motion provides a robust alternative pathway for social cognition. We perceive the goals of others not only because we can do what they do, but fundamentally because we can see the rationality of what they do.", "model": "openrouter/z-ai/glm-4.7", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric", "sample_idx": 0, "is_human": false}
{"question_id": "Viera-SenseTime-2020", "question": "A common objection to the existence of a genuine sensory system for time holds that sensory systems gather information about the world through causal influence from the relevant environmental features on those systems (e.g., photons impacting the retina for vision). Since time is often considered causally impotent\u2014it cannot exert causal force on any mechanism\u2014there cannot be a sense of time. How might one respond to this objection and explain how a clock mechanism could carry information about time without time itself causally influencing the mechanism?", "answer": "The objection you present relies on a stringent interpretation of the causal theory of perception, which holds that for a sensory system to represent a specific property of the world, that property must be the direct physical cause of the sensory state. Since photons cause visual experiences, the argument goes, only things that can impact the physical world like photons can be sensed. Because time is a dimension or a metric of change rather than a forceful substance, it lacks the causal potency to \"push\" on a sensory receptor, rendering a sense of time impossible.\n\nHowever, this objection fails because it conflates the *vehicle* of information with the *content* of information. It assumes that because a mechanism is physical, it can only be sensitive to physical forces. While true that the mechanism must be physically perturbed, the content it represents need not be the force itself, but rather the *structure* or *regularity* of the causal interactions. To defend the possibility of a sensory system for time, we must decouple the representation of a parameter from the direct causal influence of that parameter.\n\nConsider the clock mechanism. A clock does not track time because \"time\" exerts force upon its gears. Time does not flow through the escapement like water through a turbine. Rather, a clock tracks time by exploiting the uniformity of other causal processes. For instance, in a pendulum clock, the causal force is gravity acting on the mass of the bob, and the rigidity of the rod. The interaction of these forces creates a regular oscillation. The clockwork mechanism translates the *number* of these oscillations into the position of hands on a face.\n\nThe information the clock carries about time is not derived from time itself, but from the *correlation* between the event count and the external metric of time. The clock stands in an isomorphic relation to the passage of time. It is a physical system whose state changes in a lawful, predictable way. When we read a clock, we are not detecting temporal energy; we are detecting the current state of a system that reliably covaries with temporal duration. The \"information\" is a structural mapping: the spatial position of the hand represents the elapsed duration not because time moved the hand, but because the mechanism\u2019s internal causal history corresponds to the temporal history of the universe.\n\nWe can apply this logic directly to biological sensory systems. A \"sense of time\" does not require a temporal organ struck by \"chronons\" (particles of time). Instead, it requires a neural mechanism capable of generating or tracking internal regularities that covary with external events. For example, neural circuits in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (the circadian clock) do not sense time directly; they oscillate based on gene expression feedback loops. The causal mechanism is entirely biochemical, but the *function* of this oscillation is to track the 24-hour light-dark cycle caused by the Earth's rotation.\n\nFurthermore, regarding sub-second timing (interval timing), cognitive scientists propose \"pacemaker-accumulator\" models. Here, neural pacemakers emit pulses at a steady rate (caused by electrochemical gradients), and an accumulator counts these pulses while an attentional gate is open. The resulting number of pulses represents the duration of an event. Just as the clock hand moves due to gears, the accumulator's value changes due to neural firing. The mechanism is purely causal and physical, yet it carries information specifically about time because it quantifies the *interval* between cause and effect.\n\nTherefore, the objection that time cannot be sensed because it is causally impotent mistakes the nature of representation. A sensory system is an information processor. It can represent abstract parameters like time without those parameters being the direct cause of the sensory state, provided the system's physical states reliably covary with changes in that parameter. We do not need time to push us; we only need a mechanism that changes in step with it.", "model": "openrouter/z-ai/glm-4.7", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric", "sample_idx": 0, "is_human": false}
