**Introduction**

The objection that we lack a genuine sensory system for time because time is causally impotent presents a formidable challenge to our understanding of temporal perception. At first glance, the argument appears intuitive and structurally sound. Standard sensory systems—vision, audition, olfaction—operate via a causal chain in which environmental entities (photons, ai",openrouter/z-ai/glm-4.7,rubric_v2_tryhard,2,False,openrouter/z-ai/glm-4.7,6,6,6,6,6,5,35,2026-02-02T21:22:05.690796
Viera-SenseTime-2020,"The objection to the existence of a sensory system for time—rooted in the causal impotence of the temporal dimension—rests on a deeply intuitive, yet ultimately reductive, understanding of how sensory systems acquire information about the world. The intuition is straightforward: vision works because photons strike the retina; hearing works because pressure waves impact the cochlea. In each case, the distal stimulus exerts a physical force upon the proximal sensory organ.

Viera-SenseTime-2020,"The objection that we cannot possess a genuine sensory system for time because time lacks causal efficacy is intuitively powerful.

The problem of time perception presents a unique challenge in the philosophy of mind and perception.

The human capacity to perceive the actions of others as meaningful—rather than as mere, chaotic physical motion—is one of the most distinct and socially significant faculties of the mind.

### Introduction

When we observe a dancer leap across a stage or a surgeon maneuver a scalpel, we do not merely see the displacement of mass in space; we immediately perceive these movements as *actions* directed toward *goals*.
