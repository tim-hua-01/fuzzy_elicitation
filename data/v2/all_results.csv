**Introduction**

The objection that we lack a genuine sensory system for time because time is causally impotent presents a formidable challenge to our understanding of temporal perception. At first glance, the argument appears intuitive and structurally sound. Standard sensory systems—vision, audition, olfaction—operate via a causal chain in which environmental entities (photons, ai",openrouter/z-ai/glm-4.7,rubric_v2_tryhard,2,False,openrouter/z-ai/glm-4.7,6,6,6,6,6,5,35,2026-02-02T21:22:05.690796
Viera-SenseTime-2020,"The objection to the existence of a sensory system for time—rooted in the causal impotence of the temporal dimension—rests on a deeply intuitive, yet ultimately reductive, understanding of how sensory systems acquire information about the world. The intuition is straightforward: vision works because photons strike the retina; hearing works because pressure waves impact the cochlea. In each case, the distal stimulus exerts a physical force upon the proximal sensory organ.

Viera-SenseTime-2020,"The objection that we cannot possess a genuine sensory system for time because time lacks causal efficacy is intuitively powerful.

**Introduction**

The problem of time perception presents a unique challenge in the philosophy of mind and perception. We possess a vivid, immediate experience of duration, succession, and simultaneity, yet the ontological status of time renders it suspicious as an object of sensory perception. Unlike sight, which detects electromagnetic radiation, or hearing, which detects pressure waves, a “sense of t",openrouter/z-ai/glm-4.7,answer_without_rubric_2k,23,False,openrouter/z-ai/glm-4.7,5,6,5,5,5,6,32,2026-02-02T23:26:39.483839
Viera-SenseTime-2020,The objection to the existence of a genuine sensory system for time—rooted in the causal impotence of temporal properties—presents a formidable challenge to any philosophy of mind or perception that seeks to treat time as a perceptible dimension of reality. The objection relies on a widely held intuitive distinction between the objects of perception and the medium in which they exist. We can see the red apple because light waves of specific wavelengths interact with our retina; we can hear the b,openrouter/z-ai/glm-4.7,answer_without_rubric_2k,24,False,openrouter/z-ai/glm-4.7,5,6,5,6,6,6,34,2026-02-02T23:26:39.483839
Viera-SenseTime-2020,"To address the objection that a genuine sensory system for time is impossible due to time’s causal impotence, we must first rigorously dissect the premises of the objection itself. The objection relies on a specific, perhaps overly restrictive, interpretation of how sensory systems operate and what it means for a feature of the environment to be ""causal.""

Viera-SenseTime-2020,"The objection you have raised—let us call it the ""Causal Impotence Objection""—represents one of the most formidable challenges to the notion of a genuine ""sense of time."" It strikes at the very heart of how we define perception and sensory systems. The intuition is straightforward: our sensory faculties are designed to detect concrete features of the environment, and this detection occurs via a physical interaction.

Viera-SenseTime-2020,"The objection to the existence of a genuine sensory system for time, rooted in the causal impotence of time, represents a formidable challenge in the philosophy of perception and the metaphysics of time. It forces us to confront the nature of sensory transduction and the ontological status of temporal properties. At its core, the objection posits a simple dichotomy: for a sensory system to detect a feature of the world, that feature must be capable of interacting causally with the system.

Viera-SenseTime-2020,"To address the objection that a genuine sensory system for time cannot exist because time is causally impotent, we must first carefully dissect the underlying assumptions regarding the nature of sensory systems, the ontology of time, and the mechanics of information carrying.
