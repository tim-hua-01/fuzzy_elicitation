**Introduction**

The objection that we lack a genuine sensory system for time because time is causally impotent presents a formidable challenge to our understanding of temporal perception. At first glance, the argument appears intuitive and structurally sound. Standard sensory systems—vision, audition, olfaction—operate via a causal chain in which environmental entities (photons, ai",openrouter/z-ai/glm-4.7,rubric_v2_tryhard,2,False,openrouter/z-ai/glm-4.7,6,6,6,6,6,5,35,2026-02-02T21:22:05.690796
Viera-SenseTime-2020,"The objection to the existence of a sensory system for time—rooted in the causal impotence of the temporal dimension—rests on a deeply intuitive, yet ultimately reductive, understanding of how sensory systems acquire information about the world. The intuition is straightforward: vision works because photons strike the retina; hearing works because pressure waves impact the cochlea. In each case, the distal stimulus exerts a physical force upon the proximal sensory organ. Since time, according to",openrouter/z-ai/glm-4.7,rubric_v2_tryhard,3,False,openrouter/z-ai/glm-4.7,5,6,6,6,6,6,35,2026-02-02T21:22:05.690796
Viera-SenseTime-2020,"The objection that we cannot possess a genuine sensory system for time because time lacks causal efficacy is intuitively powerful. It rests on a compelling premise: sensory systems are fundamentally receivers. They transduce physical energy—photons, air pressure waves, chemical gradients—into neural signals. If vision requires the impact of photons, and hearing requires the compression of air, then a ""sense of time"" would seemingly require the impact of ""chronons"" or the temporal equivalent of p",openrouter/z-ai/glm-4.7,rubric_v2_tryhard,4,False,openrouter/z-ai/glm-4.7,5,6,5,6,6,5,33,2026-02-02T21:22:05.690796
