{"question_id": "Builes-ParadoxEvidentialEquivalence-2020", "question": "Consider the following case: You are in a room with a countable infinity of people, and each of you flips a fair coin without looking at the result. You know that all the coin flips are fair and independent. You are then informed that something remarkable happened: only finitely many coins landed heads. What should your credence be that your coin landed heads? Should it remain at 1/2, or should it change? Provide arguments for your answer.", "answer": "In this infinite coin-flipping scenario, your credence that your coin landed heads should be **0**. While the intuition that the coin remains fair\u2014suggesting a credence of 1/2\u2014is initially compelling due to the physical independence of the flips, it fails to account for the radical evidential shift introduced by the information \"only finitely many heads.\" The correct response requires reframing the problem from one of local probability to one of global limiting frequency.\n\nThe argument for a credence of 0 rests on the principle of \"natural density\" as the only coherent way to extend probability judgments to infinite sets. Consider a finite approximation of this case: if there are $N$ people and you are informed that only $k$ coins landed heads, your credence that you are one of the heads is precisely $k/N$. This is not because the coin changed its nature, but because the information constrains the sample space to those worlds where the frequency of heads is $k/N$.\n\nNow, imagine a sequence of scenarios where the number of people $N$ increases, but the number of heads $k$ remains fixed (or grows much more slowly than $N$). As $N$ approaches infinity, the ratio $k/N$ approaches 0. Since the actual scenario describes the limit of this process\u2014where the population is infinite but the heads are finite\u2014the rational credence must track the limit of the finite probabilities. To maintain a credence of 1/2 is to ignore the fact that, in the relevant sample space defined by the new evidence, the \"density\" of heads is vanishingly small.\n\nOne might object that the fairness of the coin entails that the probability of *my* specific flip being heads is independent of the total number of heads. However, this objection conflates *intrinsic propensity* with *epistemic credence*. The propensity of the coin was indeed 1/2 before the flip. But the proposition \"only finitely many heads\" has a prior probability of 0 (in the standard measure-theoretic sense). Receiving information of probability 0 shatters the prior probability space. You are no longer reasoning about a \"typical\" world governed by the Law of Large Numbers; you are in an anomalous world where the laws of large numbers spectacularly failed. In such a world, the empirical fact is that heads are infinitely rarer than tails. Given that you have no information distinguishing your position from the infinity of others, you must assume you are a generic member of this set.\n\nA further objection is the \"sombody-must-be-a-head\" intuition: if the credence is 0 for everyone, and yet some coins are heads, a paradox emerges regarding the uniqueness of the heads. However, this is merely a feature of reasoning about infinite uniform distributions. It simply highlights that in an infinite set, an event can occur (some coins are heads) even if the probability of any particular element instantiating that property is 0.\n\nTherefore, upon learning that only finitely many coins landed heads in an infinite collection, your credence must shift to 0. The information provided is not merely background noise; it strictly defines the asymptotic frequency of the outcome, and rational self-locating beliefs must align with that frequency.", "model": "openrouter/z-ai/glm-4.7", "prompt_variant": "answer_with_rubric", "sample_idx": 0, "is_human": false}
{"question_id": "Enoch-FalseConsciousnessLiberals-2020", "question": "What makes adaptive preferences\u2014preferences shaped in response to constraints on one's feasible options\u2014less than fully autonomous? Consider whether subjectivist accounts (such as Frankfurt's hierarchical model of desire endorsement), content-based accounts (which evaluate the moral quality of what is preferred), or historical accounts (which examine how the preference was formed) best explain the autonomy deficit that adaptive preferences seem to exhibit, particularly in cases of oppression.", "answer": "The paradox of the \"happy slave\"\u2014an individual who seemingly endorses their own subjugation\u2014poses a formidable challenge to theories of autonomy. Adaptive preferences, where a person\u2019s desires shift to match their limited or oppressive circumstances (e.g., a woman in a patriarchal society concluding she is unfit for leadership), intuitively represent a failure of autonomy. However, explaining *why* they fail requires distinguishing between structural compatibility and authentic agency. I argue that while subjectivist accounts fail to capture the deficit and content-based accounts risk paternalism, a historical account best explains the autonomy deficit by identifying the corrupting influence of oppression on the agent\u2019s capacity for critical reflection.\n\nSubjectivist accounts, most notably Harry Frankfurt\u2019s hierarchical model, posit that autonomy is achieved when an agent\u2019s first-order desires align with their second-order volitions (the desires about which desires they want to act on). The adaptive preference appears autonomous on this model because the oppressed individual often fully identifies with their adaptation; the woman in the patriarchal society may not only desire to stay home but may also *want* to want to stay home. Because Frankfurt focuses on the internal structure of the will at a specific moment, he cannot distinguish between a preference formed through critical reflection and one formed through survival-induced coping. If the subject identifies with the adaptation, the subjectivist must erroneously deem it autonomous.\n\nContent-based accounts, which judge autonomy based on the moral quality or rationality of the preference\u2019s object, offer a tempting corrective. One might argue that a preference for servitude is non-autonomous simply because servitude is inherently undignified. However, this approach conflates autonomy with moral prudence. An agent might autonomously choose a life of sacrifice or irrationality provided they do so with adequate information and freedom from coercion. By rejecting adaptive preferences based solely on what is preferred, these accounts deny agents the freedom to hold divergent values, effectively substituting the philosopher\u2019s judgment for the agent\u2019s own.\n\nTherefore, we must turn to a historical account, which evaluates the *procedural integrity* of the preference\u2019s formation. The autonomy deficit in adaptive preferences lies not in what is chosen, nor necessarily in the agent\u2019s current identification with it, but in the fact that the preference was formed under conditions that systematically disable the agent\u2019s critical capacities. When a person adapts to oppression, they do so because the costs of maintaining contrary desires are too high. This is not a free choice but a coercive internalization of necessity.\n\nA critic might object that a historical account leads to an infinite regress, as all preferences are historically situated and shaped by social forces. If being socially conditioned renders a preference non-autonomous, then *no* preferences are autonomous. However, this objection conflates mere influence with subjection. The historical account does not demand a pristine, unconditioned self; rather, it distinguishes between preferences formed through *dialectical engagement* with one's environment and those formed through *uncritical accommodation* to constraints. The adaptive preference is specifically a response to *feasibility limits*\u2014it is not a valuation of the world as it is, but a resignation to the world as it is permitted to be. Only a historical approach can track this specific pathology, revealing that the autonomous self has been colonized by the very constraints it should be free to evaluate.", "model": "openrouter/z-ai/glm-4.7", "prompt_variant": "answer_with_rubric", "sample_idx": 0, "is_human": false}
{"question_id": "Franzn-EvaluativeDiscourseAffective-2020", "question": "In English, the verb 'find' (as in 'Holmes finds Saltimbocca tasty' or 'She finds lying wrong') is a 'subjective attitude verb' that only allows certain predicates to embed under it\u2014evaluative predicates like 'tasty,' 'cruel,' and 'beautiful' embed felicitously, while purely descriptive predicates like 'vegetarian' or 'made of pasta' do not. Expressivists about evaluative discourse maintain that evaluative statements express non-cognitive attitudes in the same way that ordinary descriptive statements express beliefs. If it could be shown that 'find' states are non-cognitive in nature, this would provide linguistic support for expressivism, since evaluative assertions combined with denials of being in the corresponding 'find' state produce Moorean infelicity (e.g., '??It is wrong to eat meat but I don't find it wrong'). What evidence supports the thesis that the mental states attributed by 'find'-constructions are non-cognitive and specifically affective in nature, belonging to the same category as states like appreciating, loving, hating, and detesting?", "answer": "The thesis that \u2018find\u2019-constructions attribute non-cognitive, affective states is supported by the distinct grammatical and functional profile of these verbs, which aligns them with conative attitudes like disapproval or admiration rather than epistemic states like belief. The evidence rests on three pillars: the restrictive nature of syntactic embedding, the direction of fit between the mind and the world, and the constitutive role these states play in Moorean paradoxes.\n\nFirst, the most compelling evidence is linguistic: the \"complement restriction\" inherent to \u2018find\u2019. As the prompt notes, we can felicitously say \"Holmes finds Saltimbocca tasty,\" but \"Holmes finds Saltimbocca vegetarian\" is pragmatically infelicitous. This is not merely a grammatical curiosity but a window into the semantics. Descriptive predicates like *vegetarian* or *made of pasta* purport to refer to objective, mind-independent facts. Cognitive states like *belief* are geared toward tracking these facts; thus, \"Holmes believes the pasta is vegetarian\" is perfectly coherent. In contrast, evaluative predicates like *tasty* or *wrong* are not purely descriptive; they depend on a subject's orientation toward the object. The fact that \u2018find\u2019 rejects purely descriptive complements suggests that the state it attributes is not one of tracking an external reality, but of projecting an attitude onto it. This mirrors the behavior of paradigmatically affective verbs: one can *loathe* the soup being salty, but one does not *loathe* the soup being hot (unless the heat is the object of the aversion). The syntax of \u2018find\u2019 tracks the affective structure of its embedded content.\n\nSecond, we must consider the explanatory role of \u2018find\u2019-states in action. Cognitive states (beliefs) possess a \"mind-to-world\" direction of fit; they aim to represent the world accurately. Affective states possess a \"world-to-mind\" direction of fit; they aim to change the world to match the subject's desires. When we say, \"She finds lying wrong,\" this attribution serves to explain her condemnation of liars or her refusal to lie, even under pressure. A mere belief that lying has the property of wrongness might explain nothing if the agent is totally indifferent to wrongness. However, to *find* lying wrong is to be disposed to a specific negative reaction. This dispositional, motivating profile aligns \u2018find\u2019 with non-cognitive states, which are conceptually tied to motivation, rather than cognitive beliefs, which are not.\n\nA potential objection arises from the epistemic use of perception verbs, such as \"I find the wall red.\" One might argue that this is a cognitive state\u2014a perceptual belief\u2014and thus undermines the claim that \u2018find\u2019 is inherently non-cognitive. However, this objection conflates two distinct senses of \u2018find\u2019. In the epistemic sense (discovery or perception), the verb functions differently than in the subjective attitude sense. Crucially, the epistemic reading does not exhibit the complement restriction; one can \"find\" (discover) that the soup is vegetarian. The philosophical interest lies in the subjective attitude reading, which does enforce the restriction. The fact that \"I find the wall red\" sounds incomplete unless we interpret \"red\" as having some evaluative valence (e.g., \"I find the red jarring\") actually reinforces the distinction. In the attitude sense, \u2018find\u2019 demands an evaluative complement, forcing the attribution into the affective realm.\n\nFinally, the Moorean infelicity mentioned in the prompt (\"It is wrong to eat meat but I don't find it wrong\") is telling. If moral judgments were primarily beliefs about objective facts, denying one\u2019s \"finding\" of them should be no more contradictory than saying \"It is raining but I don't believe it.\" The pragmatic clash suggests that the \"finding\" state is constitutive of the judgment itself. Therefore, the linguistic restriction on complements, the motivational profile of the state, and the constitutive link to evaluation all converge on the conclusion that \u2018find\u2019-ascriptions attribute non-cognitive, affective states.", "model": "openrouter/z-ai/glm-4.7", "prompt_variant": "answer_with_rubric", "sample_idx": 0, "is_human": false}
{"question_id": "GALLOW-CAUSALDECISIONTHEORISTS-2020", "question": "Causal Decision Theory (CDT) evaluates acts by their expected utility, calculated using unconditional probabilities for states not causally downstream of your act. In 'Death in Damascus'-style cases, where you must choose between going to Aleppo or Damascus knowing that Death awaits in whichever city he predicted you would visit (with predictions being reliable but imperfect, and Death having a tendency to guess Damascus), the utility of each act depends on your current probability that you will perform that act. This means CDT's recommendations can shift as your act probabilities change during deliberation. Is this dependence on act probabilities a problem for CDT, and if so, why?", "answer": "The dependence on act probabilities in 'Death in Damascus' cases constitutes a decisive problem for Causal Decision Theory (CDT). This issue, known as \"dynamic instability,\" reveals that CDT fails to satisfy a fundamental requirement of a normative decision theory: the capacity to guide an agent to a stable, final decision. While CDT excels at evaluating actions from a detached, causal perspective, it collapses when applied to the lived process of deliberation, where the agent\u2019s beliefs about their own future actions are in flux.\n\nTo see why, consider the mechanics of the Death in Damascus case. Death, a reliable predictor, awaits you in the city he predicts you will visit. Suppose Death has a bias to guess Damascus. Initially, before deliberation, you might be undecided, giving a 50% chance to each city. CDT calculates expected utility causally; it recognizes that your choice does not *cause* Death\u2019s prediction, which has already been made. Given Death\u2019s bias, going to Aleppo seems safer because Death is likely in Damascus. CDT therefore recommends Aleppo.\n\nHowever, the moment you accept this recommendation, your credence in going to Aleppo rises. If you become 90% confident you will go to Aleppo, you must likewise update your belief that Death predicted Aleppo. As your confidence in your own action approaches certainty, the probability that Death is in Aleppo approaches certainty as well. Consequently, the expected utility of going to Aleppo plummets, eventually dropping below that of going to Damascus. CDT then flips its recommendation. Yet, if you switch to preferring Damascus, your probabilities shift again, restarting the cycle.\n\nThis dependence on act probabilities is fatal because it treats the agent\u2019s current state of mind as a fixed input rather than a variable that the theory itself influences. A functional decision theory must act as a \"fixed point finder.\" Ideally, a theory should identify an action that, once the agent resolves to perform it, remains the recommended action. This is the state of *deliberational stability*. In the Death scenario, CDT offers no such fixed point. It mandates that the agent endlessly oscillate between preferences, trapping them in a cycle of indecision precisely when a decision is most critical.\n\nOne might object that this instability is merely an epistemic glitch; the agent could simply ignore the shifting probabilities and \"stick to their guns.\" However, this defense misunderstands the nature of the problem. If an agent sticks to going to Aleppo even after CDT tells them that\u2014given their current high confidence\u2014Damascus is now the causally safer bet, they are acting *against* the theory\u2019s current recommendation. They are no longer following CDT; they are following a brute commitment strategy. If the theory requires you to disregard its own calculations to function, the theory has effectively abdicated its role as a guide.\n\nFurthermore, this failure exposes a deeper confusion in the causal worldview. By ignoring the \"evidential\" link between the act and the state (Death\u2019s location), CDT attempts to sever the agent from the predictors. But in a deterministic universe where predictors exist, the agent\u2019s decision *is* evidence for the state. A theory that forbids the agent from using this evidence to stabilize their deliberation forces the agent to pretend they are free from the very causal chains that bind them to the predictor. The dependence on act probabilities is not a minor computational bug; it is the symptom of CDT\u2019s inability to account for the agent\u2019s place within the causal structure it seeks to describe.", "model": "openrouter/z-ai/glm-4.7", "prompt_variant": "answer_with_rubric", "sample_idx": 0, "is_human": false}
{"question_id": "ISSEROW-MORALWORTH-2020", "question": "Many philosophers have argued that the motive of duty\u2014understood as a de dicto desire to do what is morally right\u2014cannot suffice for moral worth. On their view, praiseworthy agents must be motivated by the concrete considerations that explain why their actions are right (such as concern for others' welfare), rather than by an abstract concern for morality as such. Critics charge that agents motivated solely by duty exhibit a kind of moral fetishism or alienation from what morality is really about. Can acting solely from a desire to do what is morally right suffice as a motive for morally worthy conduct? If so, what makes such dutiful action praiseworthy?", "answer": "The charge that acting solely from the motive of duty constitutes \"moral fetishism\" relies on a false dichotomy between the abstract and the concrete. I argue that acting from a de dicto desire to do what is morally right is not only sufficient for moral worth but is, in fact, the only motive that secures the unconditional reliability of moral action. Such dutiful action is praiseworthy precisely because it represents the triumph of rational agency over the contingencies of inclination, ensuring that moral reasons are accorded their proper weight independent of our variable emotional states.\n\nCritics like Michael Stocker and Michael Smith argue that the dutiful agent exhibits a troubling alienation. Consider the doctor who visits a patient not because she cares about the patient\u2019s suffering, but because she believes \"visiting is the right thing to do.\" To Smith, this agent \"fetishizes\" the property of rightness, valuing the abstract label rather than the concrete human reality that grounds it. However, this critique conflates the *form* of the motivation with its *content*. To desire to \"do what is right\" is to desire to perform that action which possesses the property of rightness. Because moral rightness supervenes on natural features\u2014such as the promotion of welfare, the keeping of promises, or the relief of suffering\u2014one cannot successfully aim at \"rightness\" without effectively aiming at those underlying features. The agent who acts from duty does not ignore the patient\u2019s pain; rather, she recognizes that this pain is a morally decisive feature of the situation and resolves to act on it because it is morally required, not merely because she feels like it.\n\nOne might object that this analysis is too intellectual, ignoring the psychological reality of the \"cold\" dutiful agent who helps with gritted teeth. Does such an agent possess moral worth? I argue that she does, perhaps even more so than her warm-hearted counterpart. When an agent acts from sympathy, the moral worth of the action is contingent on the presence of that sentiment. Sympathy is fickle; it fades when we are tired, stressed, or alienated from the recipient. In contrast, the agent who acts solely from duty acts from a motive that is always available. By willing the good because the rational law demands it, the agent demonstrates that she is an autonomous legislator, bound to morality by necessity rather than accident. This \"cold\" action reveals a commitment to the moral law that is pure and unadulterated by self-concern or emotional volatility.\n\nFurthermore, the motive of duty serves a vital corrective function. We are not omniscient regarding our own motives. Often, what we perceive as \"benevolence\" is subtly corrupted by a desire for praise, gratitude, or the avoidance of guilt. The motive of duty, by focusing strictly on the normative status of the action, cuts through this psychological noise. It acts as a safeguard, ensuring that even when our natural affections fail, our rational commitments do not.\n\nUltimately, the praiseworthiness of the dutiful agent lies in her fidelity to the structure of normativity itself. She does not act because the world compels her affectively, but because she acknowledges a command that she gives to herself as a rational being. This is not fetishism, but the very definition of freedom. While a world full of sympathetic agents is aesthetically preferable, a world of agents who do their duty regardless of their feelings is the only world where morality is secure.", "model": "openrouter/z-ai/glm-4.7", "prompt_variant": "answer_with_rubric", "sample_idx": 0, "is_human": false}
{"question_id": "Jenkin-EpistemicRoleCore-2020", "question": "Some philosophers argue that in order for a mental state to be based on epistemic reasons (and thereby have an epistemic status as justified or unjustified), the subject must be consciously aware of those reasons. This poses a challenge for views that hold that modular, automatic cognitive processes can involve genuine epistemic basing. Does lack of conscious awareness of one's reasons preclude a mental state from being epistemically based on those reasons?", "answer": "The insistence that epistemic basing requires conscious awareness conflates the justification of a mental state with the subjective accessibility of that justification. I argue that lack of conscious awareness does not preclude a mental state from being epistemically based on reasons; rather, basing should be understood as a functional, causal integration between a mental state and its evidential ground, which can occur entirely outside the light of consciousness.\n\nTo understand why, we must first charitably engage the internalist opposition. Proponents of the \"Awareness View\" argue that epistemic basing is essentially connected to the agent\u2019s rational agency. For a belief to be \"based on\" a reason, the agent must be able to take ownership of that reason in response to rational evaluation. If a cognitive process occurs in a module\u2014such as the rapid processing of facial features\u2014there is no \"moment\" where the subject consciously holds the evidence and endorses the conclusion. Consequently, internalists argue that while we might causally explain the belief by referencing the module, we cannot say the subject holds the belief *for* the reason the module provides.\n\nHowever, this view imposes an unduly restrictive requirement on cognition that threatens to render much of our everyday perceptual knowledge unjustified. Consider the expert radiologist who instantly spots a tumor on an X-ray. She forms the belief \"There is a tumor\" immediately, without consciously enumerating the visual features (shadows, density, texture) that constitute her evidence. She cannot immediately articulate the reasons; she \"just sees it.\" If the Awareness View were correct, we would have to say her belief is not epistemically based on evidence at the moment of formation, rendering it epistemically arbitrary until she retrospectively constructs a justification. This is counterintuitive; we want to say her belief is *better* than the novice's precisely because it is more tightly based on the relevant visual data.\n\nTo resolve this, we must distinguish between *occurrent conscious access* and *functional sensitivity*. A belief is based on a reason if the belief is produced by a cognitive mechanism that is sensitive to the evidential status of that reason. In the radiology case, the doctor\u2019s belief is causally dependent on specific visual data. If that data were different\u2014say, a shadow were removed\u2014her belief would change accordingly. This counterfactual sensitivity demonstrates a basing relation: the reason plays the right kind of explanatory role in the production of the belief.\n\nOne might object that without conscious awareness, the \"reason\" is merely a cause, not a *normative* reason. However, this objection conflates the *concept* of a reason with the *state* that serves as a reason. Visual states possess content that carries normative force (they purport to represent the world). When a modular system takes this content as input and produces a belief that tracks that content, the system has utilized the normative force of the evidence. The lack of a \"spotlight\" of consciousness does not negate the normative architecture of the process; it merely means the subject is not simultaneously reflecting on that architecture.\n\nTherefore, we should reframe the problem: the question is not whether reasons are conscious, but whether they are *functionally integrated* into the cognitive economy in a way that preserves evidential relations. Consciousness is a method of monitoring, not the exclusive carrier of epistemic authority. By accepting that unconscious, modular processes can instantiate genuine epistemic basing, we preserve the justification of expert intuition, perceptual learning, and the vast majority of our cognitive lives without reducing knowledge to mere blind causation.", "model": "openrouter/z-ai/glm-4.7", "prompt_variant": "answer_with_rubric", "sample_idx": 0, "is_human": false}
{"question_id": "Koskinen-DefendingRiskAccount-2020", "question": "Several philosophers of science, including Arthur Fine and Heather Douglas, have suggested that the various applicable senses of scientific objectivity (such as procedural objectivity, convergent objectivity, and interactive objectivity) share a common basis in trust\u2014that when we call something objective, we indicate that it can be trusted. However, this characterization seems imprecise. What is the actual relationship between scientific objectivity and trust, and can we provide a more precise account of what unifies the different senses of objectivity?", "answer": "The suggestion that scientific objectivity is grounded in trust, as advanced by Arthur Fine and Heather Douglas, captures an important sociological truth about the practice of science, but as a philosophical definition, it mistakes a consequence for a cause. While trust is undoubtedly a vital social correlate of scientific activity, it is not the constitutive element that unifies the various senses of objectivity. I argue that the relationship between objectivity and trust is merely contingent: objectivity provides a warrant for trust, but the two are conceptually distinct. To provide a more precise account of what unifies procedural, convergent, and interactive objectivity, we must look beyond the attitude of the observer to the structure of the observed. The unifying principle is the **structural independence of the scientific product from the idiosyncratic will of any single inquirer.**\n\nThe conflation of objectivity with trust fails on logical grounds. Trust is a psychological or social attitude directed toward an agent or an institution, whereas objectivity is a property of methods, claims, or institutional arrangements. We can easily imagine scenarios where the two come apart. For instance, a patient might trust a specific, biased doctor because of a long-standing personal relationship, even when the doctor\u2019s diagnosis lacks objective support. Conversely, a conspiracy theorist might distrust a perfectly objective climatological model due to ideological commitments. If we define objectivity as \"that which can be trusted,\" we lose the ability to diagnose the conspiracy theorist\u2019s error as a failure of epistemic judgment; rather, we are forced to say that for the theorist, the science simply lacks objectivity. This renders the concept of objectivity purely subjective and effectively erases it as a normative ideal.\n\nTo understand what truly unifies the disparate senses of objectivity, consider how they function. Procedural objectivity relies on standardized methods to prevent the individual researcher\u2019s preferences from influencing the outcome. Convergent objectivity relies on the agreement of multiple independent researchers to filter out individual errors. Interactive objectivity relies on critical dialogue within a community to check subjective biases. In each case, the mechanism at work is the systematic removal or nullification of the individual agent\u2019s \"will\"\u2014their specific desires, perspectives, and limitations.\n\nLet us distinguish between \"perspective\" in general and \"idiosyncratic will.\" One cannot have a view from nowhere; all inquiry is perspectival. However, scientific objectivity does not require the elimination of perspective, but rather the elimination of the *arbitrary* or *unvetted* influence of the individual. For example, when measuring the boiling point of water, a scientist uses a calibrated thermometer (procedural) rather than their finger. The thermometer provides a perspective, but it is one that is independent of the scientist\u2019s impatience or visual acuity. If other scientists repeat the test and get the same result (convergent), we confirm that the finding is not reliant on one person\u2019s faulty equipment. The unity of objectivity lies in this insulation of the result from the specific contingencies of the person producing it.\n\nThis proposal reframes the work of Fine and Douglas. Their insight regarding trust is best understood as highlighting the *social function* of objectivity rather than its *ontological definition*. Science creates institutions that enforce structural independence precisely *because* doing so is the most reliable way to generate a product that strangers can trust. Therefore, trust is downstream of objectivity. It is the benefit we harvest when we successfully decouple our knowledge from the whims of the knower. By defining objectivity as independence from idiosyncratic will, we preserve a robust normative standard for science that explains why we are right to trust it, without reducing the concept of objectivity to the variable attitude of the public.", "model": "openrouter/z-ai/glm-4.7", "prompt_variant": "answer_with_rubric", "sample_idx": 0, "is_human": false}
{"question_id": "Maguire-GameBelief-2020", "question": "Some philosophers argue that there are both epistemic reasons (evidence-based) and practical reasons (concerning usefulness, harm, or moral considerations) that bear on what we ought to believe. However, these two types of reasons seem fundamentally different in kind\u2014epistemic reasons concern truth-conduciveness while practical reasons concern value or welfare. If both types of reasons genuinely bear on belief, how can they possibly interact to determine what one ought to believe, given that they seem incommensurable and thus impossible to weigh against each other directly?", "answer": "The apparent incommensurability between epistemic and practical reasons stems from a category error: we treat them as competing forces on the same scale, when in fact they play structurally different roles in the architecture of rationality. I will argue that practical reasons do not weigh against epistemic reasons to produce a net verdict; rather, practical considerations determine the *threshold* of epistemic justification required for a belief to be permissible. The interaction is not additive but constitutive: practical stakes calibrate the epistemic standard.\n\nTo see why this reframing is necessary, we must first acknowledge the strength of the \"purity\" intuition. Epistemic purists argue that belief is constitutively governed by the norm of truth, and since utility is orthogonal to truth, practical reasons cannot possibly influence what one ought to believe. This view correctly identifies that belief is not a voluntary action like raising one\u2019s arm; we cannot simply believe something because it is useful. However, the purist view struggles to explain the intuitive connection between high-stakes decision-making and the standards of evidence we demand. Conversely, a simple \"weighting\" view\u2014where we treat truth and utility as distinct inputs to a decision algorithm\u2014fails because it renders the concept of \"belief\" unstable, allowing any sufficiently strong pragmatic incentive to justify delusion.\n\nThe solution lies in recognizing that while the *aim* of belief remains truth, the *permissibility* of holding a belief in a given context is sensitive to the costs of error. Consider the classic \"Bank Cases.\" On Friday, you have no pressing need for cash, so your evidence that the bank is open suffices to justify the belief that it is open. On Saturday, however, your livelihood depends on depositing a check before close. In this high-stakes context, the same evidence seems insufficient. The practical reason (the need to deposit the check) does not provide a counter-reason to believe the bank is open; rather, it raises the evidential threshold required to rule out the costly possibility that the bank is closed.\n\nOne might object that this view leads to subjectivism, implying that truth becomes relative to the believer\u2019s interests. If practical stakes lower or raise the bar for belief, haven't we allowed utility to corrupt truth? This objection misunderstands the proposal. Practical reasons do not alter the truth conditions of the proposition; the bank is either open or not. Furthermore, they do not provide *evidence* for the proposition. Instead, they determine the relationship between the subject and the evidence. Once the context (and thus the threshold) is fixed, the epistemic question of whether the evidence meets that threshold remains purely objective.\n\nUltimately, epistemic and practical reasons are incommensurable only if we insist they must be weighed against one another. However, if we view practical reasons as setting the \"exchange rate\" between evidence and belief\u2014that is, defining the price of error in a given context\u2014the tension dissolves. We ought to believe what is supported by evidence *relative to the practical stakes of being wrong*. This preserves the truth-conduciveness of belief while accounting for the undeniable impact of our practical predicaments on our rational norms.", "model": "openrouter/z-ai/glm-4.7", "prompt_variant": "answer_with_rubric", "sample_idx": 0, "is_human": false}

However, I argue that this view conflates the *prediction* of action dynamics with the *perception* of action goals. Motor resonance is not necessary for the basic visual perception of goals; rather, it is a contingent mechanism that aids in prediction and social affiliation, building upon a foundational kinematic analysis that suffices for goal attribution.\n\nThe strongest version of the \"resonance necessity\" thesis, often derived from mirror neuron research, holds that visual information about action is inherently incomplete and can only be conceptualized as \"about a goal\" by mapping it onto the observer\u2019s own motor repertoire. Without this simulation, the argument goes, we would see only meaningless moving flesh. However, this view struggles to accommodate the independence of visual kinematics. As demonstrated by research on the \"teleological stance,\" observers can and do identify goals based purely on the rationality of an action\u2019s trajectory within situational constraints. For instance, if a robot arm moves efficiently around an obstacle to grasp a tool, observers immediately perceive the goal, despite lacking a motor repertoire capable of resonating with the robotic dynamics. This suggests that the visual system performs a sophisticated, computation-based analysis of efficiency and means-end relations independently of motor simulation.\n\nA proponent of resonance might object that while geometric reasoning applies to robots, human social perception is distinct. They might argue that for *conspecifics*, the speed and richness of understanding require direct neural matching. Yet, this objection can be met by distinguishing between *perceiving* a goal and *predicting* precise kinematics. Clinical evidence supports this dissociation: patients with severe motor impairments (e.g., spinal cord injuries or apraxia) often retain the ability to recognize the goals of actions, even if their predictive capacities for specific movements are diminished. This indicates that while motor resonance may provide high-fidelity predictive modeling, the categorization of an action as \"goal-directed\" survives its absence.\n\nCrucially, we must distinguish between the *content* of perception and the *vehicle* of understanding. The resonance theorist assumes the vehicle must be motoric. However, the visual detection of a goal-directed action is likely a function of the dorsal stream\u2019s sensitivity to biological motion and rationality, which extracts the \"why\" of an action without recruiting the motor cortex. Motor resonance is better understood not as the architect of meaning, but as a specialized add-on that facilitates prediction, synchrony, and empathy.\n\nTherefore, motor resonance is not necessary for perceiving goal-directed action. The visual system, through the analysis of kinematic rationality, provides access to the goals of others. Resonance mechanisms undoubtedly enrich our social life, allowing us to anticipate and feel with others, but they are not the gateway to intentionality; they are the inhabitants of a house that visual perception has already built.", "model": "openrouter/z-ai/glm-4.7", "prompt_variant": "answer_with_rubric", "sample_idx": 0, "is_human": false}
{"question_id": "Viera-SenseTime-2020", "question": "A common objection to the existence of a genuine sensory system for time holds that sensory systems gather information about the world through causal influence from the relevant environmental features on those systems (e.g., photons impacting the retina for vision). Since time is often considered causally impotent\u2014it cannot exert causal force on any mechanism\u2014there cannot be a sense of time. How might one respond to this objection and explain how a clock mechanism could carry information about time without time itself causally influencing the mechanism?", "answer": "The objection to a sensory system for time relies on a reductive, \"billiard ball\" model of causation, assuming that for a system to carry information about a feature $F$, $F$ must physically impact that system like photons striking a retina. This premise is false. We can explain how a clock mechanism carries information about time without direct causal influence from \"time\" itself by distinguishing between *receptive* transduction and *generative* correlation. The clock does not passively receive temporal energy; rather, it actively generates a stable, isomorphic process that maps onto the temporal dimension.\n\nTo understand this, consider how a speedometer functions. \"Speed\" is an abstract relationship between distance and time; it is not a physical entity that can collide with the mechanism. Yet, the speedometer accurately conveys information about speed. It does so because there is a systematic covariance between the rotation of the vehicle's drive shaft (a causal process) and the displacement of the gauge needle. The information is carried not because \"speed\" hits the dial, but because the internal state of the mechanism varies lawfully in tandem with the external variable. The causal chain is internal and mechanical, but the *semantic* link\u2014the information\u2014arises from the structural correspondence between the mechanism and the world.\n\nA clock works on precisely this principle, but the variable it maps is duration. Whether it is a pendulum driven by gravity or a quartz crystal vibrating under an electric current, the clock utilizes a regular, causal process that unfolds *in* time. Because the process is regular (e.g., oscillating at a specific frequency), the sequence of states of the clock correlates perfectly with the passage of time. The causal influence comes from the power source (the battery or the weights), not from time itself. The clock essentially *counts* the causal iterations of its own internal mechanism. It is this counting\u2014the accumulation of regular intervals\u2014that constitutes the information about time.\n\nThis distinction dissolves the objection to a \"sense of time.\" If we posit a biological time sense, such as the hypothesized internal pacemaker-accumulator system in neurobiology, we need not posit \"temporal particles\" striking the brain. Instead, the body would rely on biological oscillations\u2014such as the rhythmic firing of neurons or hormonal cycles\u2014whose causal dynamics provide a metric against which external events can be measured. Just as the clock does not need time to push its hands, the brain does not need time to strike its neurons. It merely requires an internal metronome whose rate of change is stable enough to serve as a standard of comparison.\n\nTherefore, the demand that time must be causally potent to be sensed rests on a confusion between the *medium* of information and the *source* of information. In time sensing, the medium and the source are identical: the process of the mechanism occurring *through* time is what allows it to represent time. A clock carries information about time not because time acts upon it, but because it acts *within* time in a way that is structurally isomorphic to the temporal metric it seeks to measure.", "model": "openrouter/z-ai/glm-4.7", "prompt_variant": "answer_with_rubric", "sample_idx": 0, "is_human": false}
