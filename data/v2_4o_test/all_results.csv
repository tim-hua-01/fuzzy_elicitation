ISSEROW-MORALWORTH-2020,"The role of duty in moral philosophy, especially as a de dicto desire to do what is morally right, has been a subject of extensive debate. Critics argue that acting solely from a sense of duty results in moral fetishism or alienation, distancing the agent from the core of moral concerns, such as empathy and care for others.

While some philosophers maintain that conscious awareness is essential for a belief to be epistemically based, a comprehensive examination of cognitive proc",openai/gpt-4o,rubric_v2_tryhard,1,False,openai/gpt-4o,4,4,4,4,4,5,25,2026-02-06T12:01:23.241932,5058,1972,1172,0
