Before you look at the result you are told something astonishing: only finitely many of the infinitely many coins came up heads. What credence should you now assign to the proposition\n\n(H)\u2003\u201cMy own coin landed heads\u201d?\n\nAt first blush it can seem that nothing has changed. Your coin was independent of the others, and you have received only global information about the whole ensemble. Shouldn\u2019t symmetry therefore preserve the original \u00bd? In what follows I argue that this is a mistake and that the uniquely coherent posterior credence is 0. I proceed in six steps\u2014first rehearsing the probabilistic background, then making the intuitive case with finite approximations, offering a formal derivation, answering the main objections, discussing the special difficulties of conditioning on measure-zero events, and finally drawing some philosophical morals about independence, self-locating belief, and the limits of Bayesian conditionalisation.\n\n1.  The Background: Why the Announcement Is Astonishing  \n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013  \nFor an infinite sequence of independent fair flips, the Strong Law of Large Numbers entails that with probability 1 the relative frequency of heads converges to \u00bd. In particular, the event\n\n(F)\u2003\u201cOnly finitely many heads occur\u201d\n\nhas unconditional probability 0. (The first Borel\u2013Cantelli lemma already suffices.) So the information you are given concerns a probability-zero event. In standard Kolmogorov probability the expression P(A | F) is therefore undefined. If we want to talk about what a rational agent should believe after learning F, we must supplement bare Kolmogorov theory with a way of conditionalising on null events. That is the technical core of the puzzle.\n\nYet even before addressing that complication, we can build some intuition.\n\n2.  A Finite Prelude: Shrinking the Head Count  \n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013  \nSuppose instead of countably many people there were N of you. You are told that at most k of the N coins (k < N) came up heads. By symmetry, every person is equally likely to be among the at-most-k lucky ones, so\n\nP(H | \u2264k heads among N) = k\u2044N .\n\nRaise N to 1,000 with k fixed at 10: the conditional probability becomes 1%. Raise N to a million: the probability plummets to 0.001%. Let N \u2192 \u221e while k stays finite: the natural limit is 0. Our problem is just the k = \u201csome finite number\u201d, N = \u2135\u2080 case, so the finite analogy strongly suggests that the answer is 0.\n\nSomeone might object that limits can mislead; infinite ensembles often have surprises not present at any finite stage. So let us now leave the realm of analogies and tackle the infinite case head-on.\n\n3.  Formal Derivation: Symmetry, Expectation, and a Contradiction  \n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013  \nLabel the people 1, 2, 3, \u2026 and write H\u2099 for the indicator variable that agent n\u2019s coin is heads (1 for heads, 0 for tails). Let\n\nS = \u03a3\u2099 H\u2099\u2003\u2003(the total number of heads).\n\nWe are given the information F = {S is finite}. Our task is to compute a coherent conditional probability \u03bc(H\u2081 | F). (Because the agents and coins are exchangeable, the label \u201c1\u201d is arbitrary; any agent\u2019s credence must come out the same.)\n\nLet p stand for that sought probability:\n\np := \u03bc(H\u2081 = 1 | F).\n\nBy exchangeability, every other agent m must have the same conditional probability p. Taking conditional expectation we get\n\n\u03bc(S | F) = \u03bc( \u03a3\u2099 H\u2099 | F ) = \u03a3\u2099 \u03bc(H\u2099 | F ) = \u03a3\u2099 p.\n\nIf p were positive, the right-hand side would be the sum of countably many positive numbers, i.e. +\u221e. But S is explicitly finite on F, so \u03bc(S | F) must also be finite. The only way to avoid contradiction is to set p = 0. Ergo\n\n\u03bc(H | F) = 0\n\nfor every agent individually. Since the event \u201cmy coin is heads\u201d is identical to \u201cH\u2099 = 1\u201d for my own n, my posterior credence must be 0.\n\nThat calculation is robust; it assumes only countable additivity and the minimal symmetry built into the problem. No more economical route exists to a different number.\n\n4.  Addressing the Main Objections  \n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013  \n\nObjection 1: \u201cIndependence guarantees the probability should stay \u00bd.\u201d  \nReply: Independence only concerns unconditional probabilities. Conditioning on a fact about the sum of all variables introduces correlations. Even in the finite case, coin results are pairwise independent yet, given the information \u201cat most k heads,\u201d they become negatively correlated. The infinite case is no different in kind\u2014just in degree.\n\nObjection 2: \u201cProbability 0 makes the event \u2018my coin is heads\u2019 epistemically impossible, yet I know it is still physically possible.\u201d  \nReply: In continuous probability spaces many physically possible events have measure 0 (e.g. a fair dart hitting exactly one rational point on the board). A rational agent can coherently assign them credence 0. Probability 0 is not logical impossibility; it is maximal improbability. Were you later to look at your coin and see heads, you would have learnt another measure-zero fact and would have to conditionalise again, just as Bayesians routinely do after observing a real number with a continuous prior.\n\nObjection 3: \u201cMaybe conditional probability is undefined here; why not regard the update as undetermined and keep \u00bd?\u201d  \nReply: While ordinary Kolmogorov conditioning breaks down on measure-zero events, the standard solution is to invoke a regular conditional probability (RCP) generated as a limit of conditioning on measure-positive approximations. In the present problem natural approximations are the sets\n\nF_k := {S \u2264 k}  for k = 1,2,3,...\n\nsince F = \u22c3_k F_k. Computing\n\nP(H\u2081 = 1 | S \u2264 k)\n\nis elementary and equals k\u2044(k+1)\u00b72^{-(k+1)} divided by P(S \u2264 k); as k grows large the ratio shrinks like k/M where M is the number of agents we \u201cconsider\u201d, and with countably many agents the limit is 0. Every coherent RCP therefore yields 0. The value \u00bd is not an admissible candidate for any RCP and therefore violates the usual Bayesian norms once null-event conditionalisation is required.\n\nObjection 4 (anthropic twist): \u201cI might have been one of those finitely many who got heads; absent a uniform probability over persons, setting the credence to 0 seems to rely on a dubious \u2018probability 1\u2044\u221e\u2019 intuition.\u201d  \nReply: The derivation above never assigns a uniform measure to people; it merely exploits the elementary fact that if every person had positive probability \u03b5 of being a head, the expected number of heads would be countably infinite. That contradiction is measure-theoretic, not anthropic.\n\n5.  The Measure-Zero Quandary Made Explicit  \n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013  \nPhilosophers sometimes ask whether Bayesian rationality should require unique conditional credences on null events or allow optionality. There are in fact three relevant norms:\n\n(i) Countable Additivity: Credence functions are \u03c3-additive measures.  \n(ii) Regularity: No contingent possibility has prior probability 0.  \n(iii) Standard Conditioning: Upon learning E, set the new credence to the old conditional probability on E.\n\nOur puzzle violates Regularity from the outset, because F had prior probability 0. But once we relax Regularity (as most Bayesians admit we must when continuous variables are present), countable additivity and the demand for a regular conditional probability fix the posterior uniquely. That is why, in the present case, the credence 0 is not merely permissible but required. One could instead abandon countable additivity, but that price is steep; doing so threatens the Kolmogorov foundation and wreaks havoc with Dutch-book theorems.\n\n6.  Philosophical Morals  \n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013  \na. Independence Is Fragile Under Conditioning  \nThe puzzle is an extreme illustration of a familiar moral: independence is not absolute but relative to what you condition on. Even classically independent variables become entangled once one learns a constraint relating them.\n\nb. Self-Locating Belief without a Uniform Prior  \nSome worry that indexical uncertainty (\u201cWhich person am I?\u201d) cannot be represented when the population is infinite because there is no uniform distribution on \u2115. But we did not need one. Exchangeability results suffice. The lesson generalises: one can reason coherently about one\u2019s own chance of having a property even in infinite settings that forbid a uniform personal prior.\n\nc. Updating on Impossibilities  \nLearning that F occurred is learning the logically consistent yet probabilistically null fact that the real world is extraordinarily atypical. The standard Bayesian recipe of conditioning on measure-zero events\u2014via regular conditionals or limits of positive-measure events\u2014handles that scenario smoothly. We should resist the temptation to treat null evidence as delivering no information.\n\nd. The Spectrum of Credence Revision  \nAt one pole lie \u201csharp\u201d updates that drive probabilities to 0 or 1 despite the physical possibility that things could be otherwise. At the other are \u201csmeared\u201d updates that retain much of the prior. Puzzles like ours show that sharpness is sometimes forced by coherence. That observation may matter when considering epistemic permissivism or imprecise-probability approaches; one cannot in general maintain the old credence just because the new evidence is global or \u201cdistant\u201d.\n\nConclusion  \n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013  \nOnce we treat the announcement \u201conly finitely many heads\u201d with the same probabilistic seriousness we accord any other information, the original symmetry that supported the \u00bd credence evaporates. Conditioning on a global constraint that can be satisfied by at most finitely many of countably many independent trials induces an extreme negative correlation: almost every coin must be tails. Formal symmetry, countable additivity, and the existence of a regular conditional probability together force the posterior credence for any particular coin to 0. Philosophically, the case drives home how learning measure-zero facts can rationally swamp previous independent evidence, and how the concepts of independence, self-location, and conditionalisation interlock when infinity intrudes.", "output_tokens": 3988, "reasoning_tokens": 1664}

The case of the \u201cmiraculous room\u201d of coin-tossers is a paradigmatic laboratory in which to examine the tensions.  I shall argue for the following thesis.\n\nThesis\u2003Upon learning that only finitely many of the countably many coins landed heads, a rational agent should set her credence that her own coin landed heads to 0.  Although the event on which we condition has prior probability 0, a well-motivated regular conditional distribution exists and yields that value.  The appearance that the answer ought to remain \u00bd stems from a misplaced appeal to independence; once we condition on the global event, the outcomes of the individual coins become stochastically dependent, and that dependence\u2014together with a self-locating symmetry principle\u2014drives the conditional credence to 0.\n\nThe argument proceeds in five stages.  I (1) lay out the set-up formally and show why the ordinary rule of conditionalisation is seemingly silent.  I then (2) develop an intuitive \u201cratio of heads to people\u201d argument that strongly suggests the answer 0.  Because intuitive counting is cheap currency in infinity, I (3) prove a theorem establishing the same result via a standard measure-theoretic construction of regular conditional probabilities.  I then (4) answer three objections, the most important of which presses that we are not \u201crandomly selected\u201d from the population.  Finally (5) I draw some philosophical morals about conditioning on null events, independence, and self-location.\n\n1.  Formalising the problem\n\nLet \u03a9 = {H, T}^\u2135\u2080 be the sample space of all bi-infinite sequences \u03c9 = (\u03c9\u2081,\u03c9\u2082,\u2026) of coin tosses, where \u03c9_i = 1 (\u201cH\u201d) or 0 (\u201cT\u201d).  The probability measure P is the usual product measure assigning probability (\u00bd)^n to each cylinder determined by finitely many coordinates.  For each i\u2208\u2115, let H_i be the event {\u03c9 : \u03c9_i = 1}.  Let F be the \u03c3-algebra generated by the cylinder sets.\n\nDefine E = \u201conly finitely many coins land heads\u201d, i.e.\n\nE = {\u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9 : \u03a3_{i=1}^\u221e \u03c9_i < \u221e }.\n\nKolmogorov\u2019s zero-one law or any elementary application of the strong law of large numbers shows P(E)=0.  We, the agent indexed as i=1 without loss of generality, learn E.  (If you prefer, rename the people after the fact while keeping the \u03c3-algebra and measure fixed; the symmetry considerations below remain intact.)  We want P(H_1 | E).  Ordinary conditional probability is defined only when P(E)>0.  We thus need some principled extension of conditionalisation to null events.\n\nTwo general responses are available:\n\nA.  Scepticism: because conditioning on measure-zero events is undefined, rationality places no constraint on our credence; retain \u00bd or pick whatever feels right.\n\nB.  Regularisation: look for a well-behaved family of conditional probabilities {P_E} (\u201cregular conditionals\u201d) that extend the ordinary definition.  In standard Borel spaces such families always exist and can typically be rendered unique by natural symmetry constraints.\n\nI pursue route B.  But before plunging into the formalities, it helps to see why the answer \u00bd is already doubtful.\n\n2.  The ratio-of-heads argument\n\nImagine walking around the (possibly infinitely large) room after the tosses have taken place but before anyone has looked.  God tells the crowd: \u201cOnly finitely many of you have a heads.\u201d  Instantly everyone realises that, for all but finitely many people, their personal outcome must be tails.  Equivalently, among the population of observers there is a set H_* of heads-holders that is finite, and its complement T_* is infinite.  Now ask: if you pick a person uniformly at random from a set containing finitely many heads and infinitely many tails, what is the probability that the person picked has a head?  The natural answer is 0, because any finite subset has measure zero relative to an infinite one when we use the natural count (cardinality) to induce the uniform distribution.  Since (under typical symmetry principles) each person should regard herself as such a \u201crandomly selected\u201d member\u2014there is nothing that distinguishes me from you before we look at our coins\u2014each individual should give weight 0 to being in the finite, exceptional class.\n\nOne might immediately object: uniform selection from a countably infinite set is itself problematic.  Indeed, there is no finitely additive, countably additive measure on \u2115 that gives every singleton equal positive weight.  But the weight 0 conclusion we just drew does not rely on assigning a positive probability to each individual.  Instead it exploits a simple domination principle: if X is finite and Y is infinite and we attach equal mass to each element, then for any finitely additive measure that treats singletons equally, \u03bc(X)=0 and \u03bc(Y)=1.  So the intuitive verdict (credence 0) emerges even without a non-paradoxical \u201cuniform\u201d distribution over \u2115.  The real worry, then, is not in the counting but in the symmetry claim that justifies treating oneself as an arbitrary member of the population.  I postpone discussion of that until Section 4.  First we show that the 0 answer survives more rigorous scrutiny.\n\n3.  A theorem about the regular conditional\n\nBecause E is a tail event (its truth is unaffected by altering any finite set of coordinates), the Kolmogorov zero-one law ensures P(E)=0, but it also furnishes a canonical family of regular conditionals constant on tail \u03c3-algebras.  Here is the crucial lemma; the proof uses only exchangeability and elementary inequalities.\n\nLemma\u2003Let E_n = {\u03c9: \u03a3_{i=1}^\u221e \u03c9_i \u2264 n}.  For each n, P(E_n)>0.  Define\n\np_n = P(H_1 | E_n) = P(H_1 \u2227 E_n) / P(E_n).\n\nThen (i) p_n \u2264 n/m for every m\u2208\u2115, and hence (ii) p_n = 0 for all n.  Therefore any limit of {p_n}\u2014and hence any regular conditional probability obtained by approximating E by the nested sequence {E_n}\u2014must assign probability 0 to H_1.\n\nProof Sketch.  Fix n.  Let m be arbitrary.  By exchangeability, the expected number of heads among the first m coins conditional on E_n is m\u00b7p_n.  But on E_n there are at most n heads in total, so certainly at most n among the first m.  Hence m\u00b7p_n \u2264 n, i.e. p_n \u2264 n/m.  Since m can be made arbitrarily large while n is fixed, p_n=0.  QED.\n\nBecause {E_n} \u2193 E, Theorem 33.2 of Billingsley (Probability and Measure, 3rd ed.) guarantees that any regular conditional probability obtained via such a nested approximation is unique P-almost everywhere.  Accordingly, P(H_1 | E)=0.\n\nReaders anxious about the dependency of the regular conditional on the choice of approximating sequence may note two points.  First, the sequence {E_n} is the most natural of all: it mirrors the content of E exactly.  Second, any other \u201creasonable\u201d sequence that captures E from above will produce the same limit because Lemma 1 actually shows p_n=0 already, with no passage to the limit required.\n\nThus, on the best worked-out theory we have, the answer is unambiguously 0.\n\n4.  Answering objections\n\nObjection 1:  \u201cIndependence says my coin is fair no matter what happens elsewhere.\u201d  \nReply.  Independence licences factorisation for unconditional probabilities: P(H_1 \u2227 A) = P(H_1)\u00b7P(A) when A depends only on other coins.  But the event E is not independent of H_1; it explicitly contains information about \u03c9\u2081.  Conditioning typically destroys independence.  Simple finite analogues illustrate the point: if two fair coins are tossed and you learn \u201cat most one head occurred,\u201d the conditional probability that your coin is heads is \u2153, not \u00bd.\n\nObjection 2:  \u201cI am not randomly selected from the crowd; I am a particular individual.  Why should a counting argument that treats me as typical matter?\u201d  \nReply.  The force of the counting argument resides in a self-locating symmetry principle (\u201cindexical indifference\u201d): before you look at your coin, there is nothing in your experiential state that picks you out from the rest.  If the physical setup is completely symmetric and you have no evidence of being special, rationality demands credences invariant under permutations of the observers.  From that symmetry, it follows that your credence must coincide with the probability that a randomly chosen observer (according to the symmetric measure) has heads.  One can deny the symmetry principle, but doing so generates implausible epistemic asymmetries.  For example, if you insisted on \u00bd while I adopt 0, yet both of us occupy observationally identical roles, our difference would be epistemically arbitrary.\n\nObjection 3:  \u201cConditionalisation on null events is ill-defined; different approximations could yield different answers.\u201d  \nReply.  Two responses.  First, even if strict Bayesianism declined to constrain your credence, you still need some rational principle to exploit the information that tails overwhelmingly dominate heads.  The symmetry-based regular conditional offers such a principle; the \u00bd rule offers none.  Second, the alleged non-uniqueness is illusory here.  Any approximating sequence that (a) is measurable with respect to the same tail \u03c3-algebra and (b) captures the essential content of E must, by Lemma 1, yield probability 0.  The independence of the answer from the chosen route thus mimics the well-known uniqueness of conditional expectation in L\u00b2.\n\n5.  Philosophical morals\n\n5.1  Conditioning on probability-zero events.  \nCases like ours tempt one to abandon conditionalisation altogether when P(E)=0.  That move is premature.  Regular conditional distributions extend the Bayesian machinery smoothly whenever the underlying probability space is standard Borel\u2014exactly the situation in which almost all scientific models live.  Learning E is akin to learning that a continuous random variable took some definite value.  Bayesians routinely handle that by invoking densities or Dirac deltas.  Our scenario is no worse.\n\n5.2  The fragility of independence.  \nIndependence is not a metaphysical relation; it is a statistical property encoded in a probability measure.  Conditionalisation often destroys it.  That fact bears on recent debates about so-called independence principles in epistemology and philosophy of science.  For instance, some advocates of the Principal Principle (linking objective chance to credence) insist that conditionalising on \u201cadmissible\u201d information should never alter one\u2019s credence about an outcome\u2019s fairness.  The miraculous-room example shows that even purely chancy information about distant tosses can be inadmissible once we pass to global events relating the tosses.\n\n5.3  Self-locating uncertainty.  \nObservers commonly treat themselves as typical among some reference class.  The Sleeping Beauty debate, Doomsday reasoning, and Boltzmann-brain puzzles all turn on which class is relevant.  The present case is unusually clean: every observer is qualitatively identical prior to looking at her coin, and the global information E does not break that symmetry.  Hence the principle of indifference over persons seems mandatory.  Critics sometimes complain that indifference is untenable in infinite contexts; but the regular-conditional machinery shows that the principle works fine so long as we combine it with countable additivity and the humility to assign probability 0 to being in special, measure-zero sub-classes.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe miraculous announcement \u201conly finitely many heads\u201d is powerful information.  Far from being irrelevant to the fate of your own coin, it virtually guarantees that you got tails.  Both intuitive counting and rigorous measure-theoretic analysis agree: the unique, well-motivated posterior credence is 0.  The case teaches three lessons of general philosophical interest: (i) Bayesian conditionalisation extends coherently to probability-zero events when regular conditionals are available; (ii) conditional independence is fragile, so one must not na\u00efvely import prior independence into the posterior situation; and (iii) self-locating symmetry arguments remain compelling even in countably infinite settings, provided we are willing to let \u201ctypicality\u201d be represented by probability 0 events.  Recognising these morals helps immunise us against the seductive but mistaken thought that, in the face of miraculous global information, \u201cmy coin is still fair.\u201d", "output_tokens": 4377, "reasoning_tokens": 1536}

Learning that at most one head was tossed among three fair and independent coins makes it very unlikely that yours is the lone head.  What is puzzling in the present case is simply the scale: an \u03c9-sized population of tossers and\u2014exactly as in the finite case\u2014 the information that \u201cthe total number of heads is finite.\u201d  Should that information matter to *your* toss?\n\nMany philosophers\u2019 first reaction is: \u201cIt cannot possibly matter.  My own coin is still a fair, independent coin; whatever the others did is irrelevant.  The right answer is \u00bd.\u201d  A second reaction, usually occurring a few minutes later, is: \u201cWait\u2014if all but finitely many coins are tails, then almost everyone\u2019s coin is tail.  Surely I should expect to be \u2018typical\u2019; so my probability of heads should plunge toward zero.\u201d  The tension between these two reactions turns on deep questions about (i) what it means to update on an event of probability zero, and (ii) how to think about self-location in an infinite population.  I shall argue that, given familiar Bayesian principles extended to cover zero-probability evidence, the rational credence in Heads after receiving the report is *not* \u00bd but 0.  I then explain why the contrary view is tempting and why one might, under different epistemic norms, indeed stick with \u00bd.\n\nOutline of the discussion\n\n1. Precisifying the case  \n2.

Concluding moral\n\n1.  Precisifying the case\n\nLet \u3008X\u2081, X\u2082, \u2026\u3009 be a sequence of i.i.d. Bernoulli(\u00bd) random variables with X\u2099=1 when the n-th coin lands heads and 0 otherwise.  Let F denote the event that \u03a3\u2099 X\u2099 < \u221e (i.e. only finitely many heads).  Standard probability theory tells us Pr(F)=0, because by the Strong Law of Large Numbers the proportion of heads converges to \u00bd almost surely.\n\nEveryone in the room is labelled by a natural number.  You know you are person i for some fixed, publicly known i (say, #1), and you have not yet looked at your own outcome.  The evidence you receive is precisely F.  The evidential question is: what is Pr(X\u1d62 = 1 | F)?\n\n2.  The zero-probability obstacle and \u201climit\u201d conditionalisation\n\nBayesianism says: update by conditionalisation.  But conditional probability Pr(A | F) is undefined when Pr(F)=0.  Philosophers and probability theorists have responded by enriching the formalism:\n\nPopper-Renyi conditional probabilities  \nRadically, one simply takes conditional probability as primitive, allowing Pr(A | B) to be coherent even when Pr(B)=0, provided certain axioms are met.\n\nRegular conditional distributions  \nWithin Kolmogorov\u2019s framework one can define Pr(A | \u2131) for a \u03c3-algebra \u2131, and then obtain Pr(A | F) by taking limits of more elementary events that approximate F from \u201cwithin.\u201d  In our case the natural approximating family is  \nF\u2096 : \u201cAt most k heads in total,\u201d  k=0,1,2,\u2026\n\nEach F\u2096 has positive probability, and F = \u22c3\u2096 F\u2096.\n\nLimit-based conditionalisation (Bacchus, Goldblatt, McGee) adopts:\n\nPr(A | F) := lim\u2096\u2192\u221e Pr(A | F\u2096) whenever that limit exists and is independent of the approximating sequence.\n\nI shall employ that rule, noting that alternative Popper-style accounts deliver the same verdict in this case.\n\n3.  A decisive expectation argument: Pr(H | F)=0\n\nBecause the coin tosses are exchangeable, conditioning on any permutation-invariant event (and F is such an event) must treat each position identically.  Hence there is a single number p_k = Pr(X\u2081=1 | F\u2096) that also equals Pr(X\u2099=1 | F\u2096) for every n.\n\nNow compute the expected number of heads given F\u2096:\n\nE[\u03a3\u2099 X\u2099 | F\u2096] = \u03a3\u2099 Pr(X\u2099=1 | F\u2096) = \u03a3\u2099 p_k.\n\nBut by definition of F\u2096, at most k heads occur, so that expectation is \u2264 k.  If p_k were any positive real, \u03a3\u2099 p_k would diverge to \u221e, contradicting that bound.  Therefore p_k must be 0.  \n\nTaking limits:\n\nPr(X\u2081=1 | F) = lim\u2096\u2192\u221e p_k = 0.\n\nSo your rational credence in Heads, conditional on F, is zero.\n\nThe underlying intuition is simple.  F implies that only finitely many people landed heads.  If *any* fixed positive proportion of the infinite crowd retained a non-zero chance of heads, the expected total number of heads would explode.  The only way to cap the expectation is to reduce the per-person probability to 0.\n\nA quick objection dealt with  \n\u201cBut *some* people *did* land heads; the probability cannot be zero for them!\u201d  Correct: conditional on F there is a finite, but random, set of indices whose coins are heads, and for each such \u2018lucky\u2019 index it is true that X\u1d62=1.  What the calculation shows is that the *prior* probability that any *given* index is among that finite set is 0.  A perfectly possible outcome may have zero probability in an infinite sample space; this is as unremarkable as the fact that any exact real number has probability 0 when you pick uniformly from [0,1].\n\n4.  Steelmanning the \u00bd view\n\nAlthough the expectation argument is decisive within standard probability theory, the opposing reaction deserves respect.  Let me reconstruct it as a principled position.\n\n(4.1) Independence.  You were told in advance that the coins are independent.  Independence, on a frequentist reading, implies that learning about the other coins tells you nothing about yours.\n\nReply: Independence means Pr(X\u1d62=1 \u2227 X\u2c7c=1)=Pr(X\u1d62=1)Pr(X\u2c7c=1) at the *prior* stage.  After conditioning on F the variables are no longer independent; indeed they become strongly negatively correlated.  Conditionalisation can destroy independence.\n\n(4.2) Self-locating indifference.  You know you are a specific person i; nothing in F singles you out.  By a \u2018principle of indifference among labelled individuals\u2019 you should regard yourself as randomly located among the \u03c9 people, and since the *frequency* of heads conditional on F is 0 (in limit) but not identically 0, the self-locating probability should remain \u00bd.\n\nReply: Indifference among labels is already accounted for by the exchangeability argument above.  An indifference that insists on Pr(X\u1d62=1 | F)=\u00bd in the teeth of that argument amounts to denying that learning global information can affect self-locating beliefs.  That is tantamount to Lewis\u2019s \u201cPrincipal Principle\u201d deprived of its conditional clause; few Bayesians accept such a restriction.\n\n(4.3) Regularity.  Many Bayesians impose the \u2018Regularity\u2019 norm that every logically possible proposition must have non-zero prior probability.  They then find it unattractive to set Pr(X\u1d62=1 | F)=0, because that would violate Regularity at the posterior stage.\n\nReply: Regularity is already lost the moment we conditionalise on F, since F itself had prior measure 0.  Once one accepts zero-measure updating, nothing in Regularity prevents zero posterior probabilities for contingent propositions.\n\nA popular slogan is \u2018zero-probability events carry no information.\u2019  That slogan is false.  The catch is that a *true* measure-zero proposition can be hugely informative exactly because its truth zeroes in on an extreme corner of the sample space that the prior probability function had almost rejected.\n\n5.  Reconciling the two reactions\n\nThe philosophical anxiety behind the half-and-half reaction is the sense that \u201cmy own toss was independent, so why should what happened en masse matter?\u201d  The mathematics shows why it must matter; but one can tell an intuitive story as well.\n\nImagine a finite but very large crowd of N people and suppose you are told \u201cat most k heads were tossed,\u201d with k \u226a N.  Now your chance of having heads is k/N: tiny.  Let k stay fixed while N\u2192\u221e.  The chance goes to 0.  The infinite-crowd/finite-heads scenario is simply the limit.  So nothing mysterious is happening; the infinite case merely packages up an elementary finite-case inference.\n\nWhat is unfamiliar is merely that the evidence F had prior probability 0.  In everyday life we rarely receive such information.  But theoretical physics and cosmology are beginning to force similar updates upon us (e.g. zero-measure anthropic conditionals); so we had better have a doctrine for them.  Bayesians do: adopt a conditional probability function (Popper-style) or define limits via a net of positive-measure approximants.  Once one does, the present puzzle evaporates.\n\nBut why does the \u00bd intuition arise with such force?  Partly because people tacitly apply \u2018screening off\u2019 principles valid only for *finite* collections.  With infinite collections, events about the *ensemble* (\u03c3-algebra generated by tail events) can correlate strongly with each individual element without singling any of them out.\n\nIndeed Kolmogorov\u2019s 0-1 law asserts precisely that: any \u2018tail\u2019 property of an i.i.d. sequence has prior probability 0 or 1, yet conditioning on such a property can drastically alter probabilities of initial coordinates to 0 or 1.  Our event F is a tail event; the 0-1 law predicts the extremal update we just derived.\n\n6.  Concluding moral\n\nYour rational credence that your coin landed heads, upon learning that only finitely many heads were tossed in the room, should be 0.  The core reason is that a single person\u2019s chance must be small enough to make the expected number of heads finite, and exchangeability then forces that chance to be zero.  The fact that F had prior probability 0 is no barrier to updating; modern Bayesianism handles it by taking limits of positive-measure approximations or by treating conditional probability as primitive.\n\nThe puzzle presents a vivid lesson: global information about an infinite system can overwhelm local independence, and measure-zero evidence can rationally drive posterior credences to the extremes.  Those who instinctively retain the \u00bd credence are implicitly assuming a norm\u2014that independent causes remain probabilistically independent after any learning\u2014that is false once one confronts the mathematics of infinity.\n\nRational belief, like physics, sometimes does surprising things at the infinite limit.  What matters is that our epistemic principles be capable of accommodating the surprises without contradiction.  On that score, the Bayesian machinery passes the test: it tells us, unambiguously and for good reason, that the chance your coin shows heads is\u2014given the remarkable announcement\u2014zero.", "output_tokens": 3717, "reasoning_tokens": 1152}

Each occupant flips a fair coin, pockets it without looking, and waits. A public announcement is then made: \u201cOnly finitely many of the coins just tossed landed heads.\u201d In the prior measure, that announcement reports an event of probability 0; indeed, by the Strong Law of Large Numbers, with probability 1 there are infinitely many heads. What, given the announcement, ought your new credence be that your own coin shows heads?  \n\nI shall argue that a rational agent should assign credence 0 (or as close to 0 as one likes) to the proposition that her coin is heads. More carefully: every principled method of updating that (i) respects independence for finite approximations, (ii) treats indistinguishable observers symmetrically, and (iii) is defined for conditioning on measure-zero events, drives the posterior P(H \u2502 F) to 0, where H is \u201cmy coin is heads\u201d and F is \u201conly finitely many heads occurred.\u201d I also examine two rival lines of resistance\u2014the \u201cindependence defence,\u201d which would leave the credence at \u00bd, and the \u201cagnostic defence,\u201d which would declare the posterior undefined\u2014and explain why neither is ultimately satisfactory.\n\n2.\u2003Why independence collapses once we condition  \nPre-announcement, the coin tosses are pairwise independent. A hasty reasoner therefore proclaims: \u201cWhether there are finitely many heads among the others is independent of my individual throw, so my credence stays \u00bd.\u201d The step is illegitimate. Independence is destroyed by conditioning on F. The intuitive reason is clear: learning that the rest of the infinite population produced at most finitely many heads drags down the *overall* head-count; my own toss now helps constitute the finite set of potential heads, so information about the total bears directly on it.\n\nThis is a generic lesson: in probabilistic models, X and Y may be independent unconditionally yet correlated in every strict conditional circumstance. (Schervish and Seidenfeld 1990 formalise the point.) So we need an explicit conditional probability P(H \u2502 F). Ordinary Bayes\u2019 rule is silent because P(F)=0; but the need for a posterior constraint is not thereby removed. The question becomes: how should a rational Bayesian extend her credence function to handle zero-probability information?\n\n3.\u2003Regular conditional probabilities by approximation  \nA standard strategy is *van Fraassen\u2013style limiting conditionalisation*: pick an increasing sequence of positive-probability \u201capproximation events\u201d whose intersection is F, condition on them in the normal way, and take the limit. Let  \n\nF n m  = \u201camong the first m+1 people, at most n heads occur.\u201d\n\nFor fixed n, m, F n m has positive probability because it imposes only finitely many restrictions on finitely many tosses. Moreover  \n\n\u22c2 n \u22c2 \u221e m=n F n m  = F.\n\nCompute\n\nP(H 0 \u2227 F n m ) = \u00bd\u00b7P(\u2264 n\u22121 heads among the other m people)  \n                 = \u00bd\u00b72 \u2212m \u2211 k=0 n\u22121 ( m k ).\n\nP(F n m ) = 2 \u2212(m+1) \u2211 k=0 n ( m+1 k ).\n\nHence\n\nP(H 0 \u2502 F n m ) = \u2211 k=0 n\u22121 ( m k ) / \u2211 k=0 n ( m+1 k ).\n\nElementary asymptotics show that the denominator\u2019s leading term ( k = n ) grows like m n /n!, whereas the numerator\u2019s leading term ( k = n\u22121 ) grows like m n\u22121 /(n\u22121)!. The ratio therefore goes like (const)/m and tends to 0 as m\u2192\u221e. Because the bound is uniform in n, the double limit (first m, then n) is 0. That proves:\n\nlim n lim m P(H 0 \u2502 F n m ) = 0.\n\nOn the hypothesis that rational update proceeds by such limits, your post-announcement credence in heads should be 0.\n\n4.\u2003A combinatorial intuition: almost nobody can be a head-toss\u00ader  \nEven without the calculus, the underlying idea is compelling. The announcement partitions the ballroom into two camps: finitely many \u201cheads people\u201d and countably many \u201ctails people.\u201d Grant an undifferentiated symmetry principle\u2014each person is qualitatively identical before the announcement\u2014and the only \u03c3-additive probability measure compatible with the symmetry, when restricted to F, assigns total mass 1 to the infinite block of tail-holders and 0 to the finite block of head-holders. The reason is simply cardinal arithmetic: you cannot sprinkle equal, strictly positive mass over \u03c9+1 many atoms and still have a \u03c3-additive measure summing to 1. One must give the \u03c9-set full measure and the n-set zero. Learning that F is true pushes you into a world where observers with tails form a metrically overwhelming majority; the chance of being one of the rare heads collapses.\n\nThink of an *infinite lottery*: tickets numbered 1,2,3,\u2026 are sold; finitely many are painted red. If you are told \u201cthe winning ticket is red,\u201d your posterior probability that you hold the winning ticket is 0, because there are only finitely many candidates. The present case differs only in that you are both the ticket and the lottery participant.\n\n5.\u2003Popper functions: a formal framework for 0-probability updating  \nSome philosophers mistrust limit procedures and demand a primitive conditional defined for every ordered pair (A,B) with P(B)\u22650. Popper functions meet that demand. Starting from the Kolmogorov field generated by all coin-toss propositions, one can extend the prior into a Popper function *P\\** whose defined conditionals include P\\*(H 0 \u2502 F)=0. The construction (e.g. McGee 1994) picks an ultrafilter over countable tails events and singles out a finitely additive measure that, when regularised to \u03c3-additivity, yields the same limiting behaviour just exhibited. So the limit argument is not a crutch; it merely *reveals* what any sensible completion of the probability space must say.\n\n6.\u2003Self-locating belief and the reference-class problem  \nCould one resist by denying that \u201cI am a random member of the ballroom\u201d is licit? Without a uniform distribution over \u03c9 many indices, maybe the symmetry argument falls. Yet the update we derived does not presuppose any antecedent random selection. All it presupposes is that before the announcement you were willing to assign positive probability \u03b5>0 to being *any particular* person. That is already built into the original indifference over people; otherwise your prior was defective. Once F is learned, the *relative* weights of individuals cannot remain equal, for that would allocate \u03b5 to each of countably many tails-people and blow up normalization. The standard way to repair normalization is to keep the equal-weight assumption among the tails (they are still symmetric) and shrink the weight of each head-person to 0. The result is exactly the Popper function above.\n\nMore intuitively, in scenarios of infinite duplication, indexical information often swamps non-indexical evidence. Learning \u201conly finitely many heads\u201d is indexical if we describe it as \u201cI find myself in a world in which only finitely many heads were tossed.\u201d The anthropic literature (Bostrom 2002; Sider 2008) teaches that such indexical updates can drive probabilities to extremal values. The present case is a bloodless illustration.\n\n7.\u2003Objection I:\n\u201cThe announcement had probability zero, so Bayesianism supplies no mandate. Rational belief becomes undefined; \u00bd remains permissible.\u201d  \n\nReply: Bayesianism without a rule for zero-probability learning is incomplete. Real agents learn all sorts of measure-zero data (exact measurement readings, for instance). Either one supplements standard Bayesianism with a regular conditional or one accepts Dutch-book vulnerability. Suppose you retained credence \u00bd in H after F. A clever bookie offers you, at fair odds, a bet that pays $1 if your coin is heads and costs $\u00bd to buy in. Simultaneously, she sells each *other* agent an exactly compensating bet whose price is set using the same \u00bd posterior you profess. Because only finitely many of those other bets can pay off, while countably many will collect stakes from their buyers, the bookie\u2019s net exposure is bounded but her income is unbounded. You are part of a group sure to lose money in aggregate, revealing incoherence in the alleged \u00bd posterior.\n\n8.\u2003Objection II:\n\u201cIndependence is a *logical* fact. No information about other coins can rationally affect my belief about mine.\u201d  \n\nReply: The alleged logical fact is a misapplication of probabilistic independence. If I condition on \u201cexactly one of the two fair coins came up heads,\u201d the probability that my coin is heads is \u00bd? No, it is \u00bd *given the independence* of the tosses preconditioning, but the conditioning destroys independence; in fact the posterior is \u00bd exactly *because* the event is symmetric between the two coins. Remove symmetry by changing \u201cexactly one\u201d to \u201cat most one,\u201d and my posterior probability that I am the head increases to \u2154. Analogously, the claim that F is information about \u201cother coins only\u201d is false: F is a conjunction across *all* coins, including mine. My toss is one of the infinitely many constrained by F; hence it is evidentially relevant.\n\n9.\u2003Residual worry: numerical extremity  \nCredence 0 may feel too strong: shouldn\u2019t an event of probability \u00bd retain *some* weight, however tiny? The answer is that \u201cmy coin is heads\u201d is not a mere event of prior probability \u00bd; it is one component of an outcome space whose structure has been radically re-weighted by the new evidence. After conditioning, every finite set of people bears probability 0 of containing you, and the head-people constitute a finite set. Since H entails your membership in that finite set, H acquires probability 0. Nothing prevents you, as an ideal Bayesian, from assigning credence 0 to events that were formerly quite live; what matters is coherence relative to the total body of evidence.\n\n10.\u2003Agnostic alternative: imprecise credence  \nSuppose someone balks and adopts an imprecise posterior interval, say [0,\u00bd]. Must we label her irrational? I think yes, because the interval still permits \u00bd, and any selection function that chooses \u00bd is open to the Dutch-book just sketched. More generally, imprecision theories gain plausibility when rival precise updates look arbitrary; here the precise update to 0 is not arbitrary but uniquely justified by both the limiting and the symmetry arguments. Imprecision therefore buys only the superficial comfort of refusing to commit.\n\n11.\u2003Philosophical morals  \n(i) Zero-probability learning is not exotic; it is the rule whenever infinite random structures are involved. One needs a formalism (Popper functions, L\u00e9vy conforms, or limits) that makes sense of it.  \n(ii) Self-locating information interacts dramatically with cardinality. In finite cases, learning \u201cexactly k heads\u201d keeps the symmetry between heads and tails conjointly intact; in infinite cases, learning \u201cfinitely many heads\u201d breaks the symmetry, because the tails retain \u03c9-cardinality while the heads do not.  \n(iii) The epistemology of infinity forces extremes: once the informational content picks out a set of possible observer-moments of lower cardinality than its complement, the smaller set generically gets probability 0 (or 1, if roles reverse). This is a special case of a theorem due to Gaifman (2004) on Boolean algebras of infinite partitions.\n\n12.\u2003Conclusion  \nYou started in an impartial, fair-coin world. The announcement that only finitely many heads occurred is nothing short of miraculous, but *assuming you trust it*, rationality compels you to update radically. Formal Bayesianism extended to handle measure-zero events, intuitive symmetry reasoning, and Dutch-book arguments converge: your posterior credence that *your* coin shows heads should be 0. Hanging on to \u00bd misdiagnoses the evidential relevance of the announcement and violates coherence; declaring the posterior undefined leaves you without betting guidance where a uniquely coherent answer is available. In the strange evidential landscapes carved out by infinity, extremal credences are not merely permissible\u2014they are sometimes mandatory.", "output_tokens": 4448, "reasoning_tokens": 1728}

Setting the stage\n\nLet \u27e8C\u2081, C\u2082, \u2026\u27e9 be a countable sequence of independent fair coins, where C\u1d62 = 1 for heads and 0 for tails.

Hence the event\n\n\u2003F\u2002:=\u2002{\u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9 : H(\u03c9) < \u221e}   (\u201conly finitely many heads\u2019\u2019)\n\nhas \u03bc-measure 0.  You are told that F is actual.  What, now, is P(C\u2081 = 1 | F)?  The catch is immediate: ordinary Bayesian conditioning requires dividing by \u03bc(F), but \u03bc(F)=0.  Formally, the question is ill-posed until we say how to extend conditionalisation to measure-zero events.\n\nII.  Three misleading lines of thought\n\n1.  Na\u00efve independence.  One might argue: \u201cMy toss was independent of the others, so learning about them tells me nothing; credence stays at \u00bd.\u201d  That is wrong.  The event F is not solely about the other coins; it includes a claim about C\u2081.  C\u2081 is independent of the \u03c3-algebra generated by {C\u2082, C\u2083, \u2026}, but F is not in that \u03c3-algebra.  Global constraints couple otherwise independent variables.\n\n2.  \u201cI am a particular person, not a random sample.\u201d  True, you are person #1 by stipulation; yet conditional probability concerns possible states of the world compatible with one\u2019s evidence, not metaphysical modality about \u201cwhich person I am.\u201d  Evidence F restricts possible \u03c9; within those \u03c9, C\u2081 sometimes lands heads, sometimes tails.  We seek the ratio of possibilities, not a sampling interpretation.\n\n3.  Finite\u2010approximation scepticism.  Because F has probability 0, perhaps no \u201csharp\u201d answer exists and rationality imposes no constraint.  That is too pessimistic.  Probability theory offers regular conditional probabilities\u2014generalised posteriors defined \u03bc-almost-everywhere, often fixed by natural limiting procedures.  Although they are not unique on measure-zero sets, additional symmetry principles can still single out a canonical answer.\n\nIII.  A canonical limiting procedure\n\nThe orthodox way to condition on a \u03bc-null event is to approximate it by a decreasing sequence of positive-measure events and then take a limit of ordinary posteriors.  Let\n\n\u2003F\u2099 := {\u03c9 : H(\u03c9) \u2264 n}.\n\nEach F\u2099 is measurable and \u03bc(F\u2099) > 0 (in fact \u03bc(F\u2099) decreases super-exponentially with n).  Note that F = \u22c2_{n=1}^{\u221e} F\u2099.  Define\n\n\u2003p\u2099 := \u03bc(C\u2081 = 1 | F\u2099) = \u03bc(C\u2081 = 1 \u2227 F\u2099)/\u03bc(F\u2099).\n\nIf the limit lim_{n\u2192\u221e} p\u2099 exists, Bayesians usually take it to be \u03bc(C\u2081 = 1 | F).\n\nA quick calculation shows p\u2099 = 0 for every n.  Why?  Suppose C\u2081 = 1.  Then the remaining infinitely many coins must contribute at most n\u22121 heads.  But by the same Borel\u2013Cantelli argument applied to coins 2,3,\u2026 the probability of that is 0.  So \u03bc(C\u2081 = 1 \u2227 F\u2099) = 0, whence p\u2099 = 0.  The limit is trivially 0.\n\nThus, by the most straightforward regularisation, \u03bc(C\u2081 = 1 | F)=0.\n\nIV.  Exchangeability and the \u201crandom observer\u2019\u2019 angle\n\nThere is another, conceptually illuminating route to the same answer.  The joint distribution of the C\u1d62 is exchangeable; informally, everything is permutation-invariant.  De Finetti\u2019s representation theorem tells us there is a latent parameter \u0398 with a Uniform[0,1] prior such that, conditional on \u0398=\u03b8, the coins are i.i.d. Bernoulli(\u03b8).  The event F occurs exactly when \u03b8=0: if \u03b8>0 then almost surely infinitely many heads occur; if \u03b8=0 then almost surely none do (a fortiori finitely many).  Because the prior puts zero probability on a point value, \u03bc(\u0398=0)=0, cohering with \u03bc(F)=0.\n\nNow suppose, arguendo, that we did learn \u0398=0.  Given that parameter value, each coin is independently heads with probability 0.  So P(C\u2081 = 1 | \u0398=0)=0.  Since F implies \u0398=0, we recover the previous verdict from a different perspective.\n\nV.  Why \u00bd still tempts us\n\nMany people react that the argument just given must be illicit, for a world with only finitely many heads still allows C\u2081 to be heads; surely a rational agent should acknowledge that possibility.  Two remarks deflate the worry.\n\n1.  Possibility versus probability 0.  That C\u2081=1 is not ruled out logically but can still receive credence 0.  Standard probability theory assigns probability-0 to each individual point of \u211d without thereby declaring them impossible.  A posterior that makes the exceptional cases measure-zero is perfectly orthodox.\n\n2.  Countable sums of 0 can be positive.  If each agent assigns P(C\u1d62=1 | F)=0, the expected number of heads conditional on F is indeed the countable sum of zeros, which is 0; yet F allows worlds in which exactly 5 heads appear.  That is not a contradiction.  Conditional expectation is itself an integrable random variable; the fact that its integral can differ from actual realisations is familiar from, e.g., the law of large numbers.\n\nVI.  The role of indexical information\n\nCould \u201cself-locating\u2019\u2019 information salvage the \u00bd answer?  Suppose (controversially) that on learning F you are entitled to treat yourself as a randomly selected member of the infinite population.  Given that only finitely many heads exist, the chance that the random selector picks a head-owner is 0.  One again obtains credence 0.  In fact, trading on indexicality strengthens rather than weakens the zero result.\n\nVII.  Is the answer forced?\n\nBecause regular conditional probabilities are not uniquely determined on null sets, one might suspect that some rival regularisation could deliver \u00bd.  Technically that is true: we could define a quirky conditional distribution that assigns P(C\u2081=1 | F)=\u00bd while still agreeing with \u03bc on every positive-measure event.  But such a distribution would violate permutation invariance.  Symmetry under permutations of the coins is part of the background\u2014and rational agents ought to respect available symmetries unless compelled otherwise.  Among all extensions, the invariant one is uniquely fixed and yields 0.  So, given a minimal symmetry principle, the answer is forced.\n\nVIII.  Lessons about Bayesian norms\n\n1.  Conditionalisation:  The example vindicates the common Bayesian policy of \u201capproximate, then limit\u2019\u2019 rather than the naive ratio formula, which breaks at \u03bc(F)=0.\n\n2.  Regularity:  Finite additivity is sometimes proposed to handle conditioning on null sets, but here the finitely additive versions that make P(C\u2081=1 | F)=\u00bd behave badly\u2014they violate conglomerability across the permutation partitions.  Hence \u03c3-additive orthodoxy earns its keep.\n\n3.  Independence:  Learning a global, holistic fact can create dependence between previously independent variables.  That moral carries over to epistemology: extremely low-level correlations can spring into existence once we condition on a highly specific total state of the universe.\n\nIX.  Two objections answered\n\nObjection 1: \u201cYour approximation argument secretly assumes C\u2081 tails; it is therefore question\u2010begging.\u201d  \nReply: No.  For each n, the event F\u2099 already constrains the infinite tail of the sequence enough to make the joint probability of (C\u2081=1 & F\u2099) vanish.  That vanishing is a theorem of the original product measure, not an assumption.\n\nObjection 2: \u201cIf your credence is 0, you would refuse an offer that pays \\$1 if your coin is heads at a price of an arbitrarily small \u03b5>0; that seems irrational because you might be throwing away free utility.\u201d  \nReply: A fair bet is one whose price matches expected value.  Conditional on F, the expected value of the ticket is 0; so any positive price is unfavourable.  The fact that you might get lucky is irrelevant\u2014exactly the same as refusing a lottery with probability 10^{-100} of winning \\$1 and price 1 cent.\n\nX.  Comparison with finite analogues\n\nIn a finite room of N people, being told \u201cat most k heads were flipped\u2019\u2019 would lower your credence from \u00bd to k/N (by simple symmetry).  As N\u2192\u221e while k stays fixed, that posterior tends to 0.  The infinite case can thus be viewed as the limiting behaviour of perfectly mundane finite cases.  The result is therefore not an artefact of infinity but a discontinuous limit we should have expected.\n\nXI.  Broader philosophical pay-off\n\n1.  The case dramatizes how qualitative information (\u201conly finitely many\u2019\u2019) can swamp ostensibly local independence.  That phenomenon underwrites several anthropic puzzles, e.g. about freak observers in an infinite multiverse.\n\n2.  It gives a concrete reason to distrust \u201ckeep old priors unless forced\u2019\u2019 rules of thumb.  Sometimes learning \u03c6 with prior probability 0 forces drastic, not incremental, revisions.\n\n3.  It counters the lingering suspicion that probability-0 events are necessarily \u201cbeyond the scope\u2019\u2019 of Bayesian epistemology.  With the right tools (regular conditional probabilities plus symmetry) rational posteriors are well-defined and verdictive.\n\nXII.  Conclusion\n\nA rational agent who learns that, in a countably infinite sequence of fair, independent coins, only finitely many landed heads should assign credence 0 that her own coin landed heads.  The naive \u00bd intuition rests on a misunderstanding of conditional independence and on an implicit refusal to extend Bayesian conditioning to probability-zero events.  Once those misunderstandings are cleared, the zero answer emerges inexorably and survives scrutiny from approximation, exchangeability, and self-location alike.  The case illustrates\u2014not for the first time but in a particularly stark form\u2014how infinite idealisations force us to refine both our probabilistic techniques and our philosophical intuitions.", "output_tokens": 4415, "reasoning_tokens": 1792}

The set-up and the puzzle  \nYou and a countable infinity of other agents each toss a fair coin in the usual way. After the tosses you are told, with certainty, that only finitely many of the infinitely many coins came up heads. Call that piece of information F (\u201cFinitely many heads\u201d). Because the coins are independent and fair, the prior probability of F is 0. The question is what your posterior credence in the proposition H (\u201cmy coin landed heads\u201d) should now be. There are two natural initial reactions.\n\nA. Independence reaction.  My coin was fair and was flipped independently of all the others.  Independence seems to insulate it from whatever aggregate fact you just learned.  So keep credence \u00bd.\n\nB. Scarcity reaction.  If only finitely many heads were produced among countably many coins, heads are incredibly scarce.  In a situation in which almost every coin in the room is a tail, it looks unreasonable to assign \u00bd to the hypothesis that one\u2019s own coin is a head.  So lower the credence\u2014perhaps all the way to 0.\n\nBoth reactions have intuitive force; the task is to decide which, if either, survives careful scrutiny.\n\nI shall argue that the rational posterior credence for H, conditional on F, is 0.  The core of the case is a symmetry argument that shows that any permutation-invariant way of updating on F must assign zero probability to head for every individual coin.  I then explain why the argument does not violate independence, why its crucial premise\u2014a symmetry constraint\u2014is compulsory in this context, and why the competing \u00bd answer collapses under pressure.  Finally I discuss what the episode teaches about conditionalising on events of probability 0 and about self-locating credences more generally.\n\n2. Conditioning on measure-zero events: what is even at stake?  \nOrdinary Bayesian conditionalisation is silent when the evidence E you learn had prior probability 0, because the Bayes quotient P(A & E)/P(E) is undefined.  The standard fix is to invoke a regular conditional probability (RCP).  For a probability space \u27e8\u03a9, \u03a3, P\u27e9, a RCP for a \u03c3-algebra \ud835\udd3d is a family of probability measures P_E such that for all E\u2208\ud835\udd3d, P_E concentrates on E and, for measurable A, the map E\u21a6P_E(A) is a version of the conditional expectation of 1_A given \ud835\udd3d.  In nice spaces (Polish spaces with Borel \u03c3-algebra), RCPs always exist but need not be unique.  What do you do when they disagree?  You add rationality constraints\u2014symmetry, independence-preservation where appropriate, minimal updating, etc.\u2014that pick out a privileged RCP.  The present case turns on one such constraint.\n\n3. The symmetry of the problem  \nThe original product measure P on \u03a9 = {0,1}^\u2115 (\u201c1\u201d=head) is invariant under every finite permutation of coordinates, and indeed under every bijection of \u2115 that moves only finitely many points.  Call this family of permutations G.  The evidence F (\u201cthere are only finitely many 1\u2019s\u201d) is also invariant under G.  A guiding norm of Bayesian rationality says: if both your prior and your new evidence treat certain transformations as symmetries of the situation, your posterior should too, absent further symmetry-breaking information.  Formally, we require:\n\n(Equivariance)  For every g\u2208G and every measurable A, P_F(g A) = P_F(A),\n\nwhere P_F is the posterior measure conditional on F and g A is the image of A under g.  The requirement is not ad hoc; without it, the \u2018\u2018update\u2019\u2019 would arbitrarily distinguish coin tosses that are objectively indistinguishable given all your information.  Any posterior that violates Equivariance would be open to a dominance argument: a symmetry lottery would reveal a sure-loss if you violate the symmetry, paralleling probabilistic versions of the Dutch book.\n\n4. The symmetry argument for P(H | F) = 0  \nLet X_n be the indicator of \u201ccoin n landed heads.\u201d  Equivariance implies that for all n,  \n\nq := P_F(X_n = 1)  \n\nis the same number; the conditional distribution treats each coordinate identically.  (Intuitively: after we learn F, nothing picks out any particular coin as special.)\n\nNow ask about the expected number of heads under P_F:\n\nE_F[\u03a3_{n=1}^\u221e X_n] = \u03a3_{n=1}^\u221e E_F[X_n]    (by linearity of expectation)  \n                  = \u03a3_{n=1}^\u221e q  \n                  = q \u00b7 \u2135\u2080.                                             (1)\n\nBut F tells us that the actual number of heads is some finite k (possibly 0).  Therefore the conditional expectation on that \u03c3-algebra must be finite\u2014indeed E_F[\u03a3_n X_n] \u2264 sup{k\u2208\u2115}.  The only way (1) can be finite is if q = 0.  Hence\n\nP_F(X_n = 1) = 0 for every n.                                           (2)\n\nIn particular, P_F(H) = 0.  Your credence that your own coin came up heads should crash from \u00bd to 0 when you learn F.\n\n5. Why the independence objection fails  \nThe coins are independent in the prior measure, but they are not independent conditional on F.  F contains information about every individual coin: if my coin is heads, the finite bound on the total number of heads is already one notch closer to being exhausted, so the joint possibilities for the rest of the sequence tighten correspondingly.  Put differently: conditional independence requires that\n\nP_F(X_n = 1 & F_other) = P_F(X_n = 1) \u00b7 P_F(F_other),\n\nwhere F_other is an event concerning only the other coins.  Nothing like that is true here; indeed P_F(X_n = 1) = 0 makes independence impossible (unless P_F(F_other)=0 for every nontrivial F_other).  So appealing to independence to hold onto \u00bd is question-begging: it assumes a structural property that fails, given the very information we are updating on.\n\n6. The \u201cwhy not \u00bd?\u201d objection in detail  \nSuppose against the argument that you insist on P_F(H) = \u00bd.  Combine that with Equivariance and countable additivity.  Then, as in (1), E_F[#heads] = \u00bd\u00b7\u2135\u2080 = \u221e, contradicting F.  To escape the contradiction you must jettison at least one of:\n\n(i) Equivariance (symmetry with respect to G),  \n(ii) Countable additivity,  \n(iii) Bayesian conditionalisation via a RCP.\n\nOption (ii) courts fanaticism; rejecting countable additivity would ripple destructively through standard probability theory.  Option (iii) would mean you refuse to conditionalise when you gain information, hardly a defensible stance for a Bayesian.  So you are forced to abandon (i), i.e. to adopt an asymmetric posterior measure that arbitrarily designates some infinite subset of coins as \u201clikely heads\u201d and the rest \u201clikely tails,\u201d even though nothing in your total evidence distinguishes them.  That strikes most philosophers\u2014and virtually all decision-theoretic protocols\u2014as irrational.\n\n7. A concrete regular conditional that realises the 0 answer  \nIt is worth seeing that the 0 answer is not merely an abstract existence proof.  One explicit RCP goes like this:\n\n\u2022 First choose a finite K with prior P(K = k | F) proportional to 2^{\u22122k}.  \n\u2022 Then choose K distinct indices n_1,\u2026,n_K according to the uniform distribution on k-element subsets of \u2115.  \n\u2022 Put X_{n_i}=1 for i=1,\u2026,K, and X_m=0 for every other m.\n\nBecause K is almost surely finite and because the index-selection step treats all coordinates symmetrically, (2) holds: each fixed coordinate has probability 0 of being among the selected n_i\u2019s.  The construction shows the abstract argument is implementable inside the standard probability space.\n\n8. Worries about being \u201crandomly selected\u201d  \nSome philosophers resist the scarcity reaction by pointing out that there is no uniform probability distribution over \u2115; so what licenses treating \u201cmy coin\u201d as though it were selected uniformly at random from the countable set?  The symmetry argument above avoids that pitfall: it derives P_F(H)=0 without presuming such a selection.  What does the heavy lifting is the permutation symmetry of both prior and evidence, not an assumption of a uniform prior over people.  The very same reasoning would apply if the coins were labelled by the rationals or by the nodes of an infinite binary tree; indeed it applies to any countably infinite indexing set endowed with the natural product measure.\n\n9. Lessons about self-locating belief  \nThe problem is a cousin of the Sleeping Beauty family of puzzles, which mix ordinary empirical information with indexical \u201cwhere am I in the world?\u201d information.  In Sleeping Beauty, the crux is whether Beauty should treat awakening on Monday as evidence about the coin outcome, given that the number of awakenings depends on that outcome.  Here the pity is reversed: we condition on a global structural feature (finitely many heads) that correlates with our indexical location (which coin we are).  The correct resolution in both cases depends on respecting symmetry constraints.  In Sleeping Beauty, the symmetry supporting the \u201c\u2153 view\u201d is between awakening tokens within the same experimental run; in our puzzle it is permutation symmetry between coins.  The moral is that self-locating information need not break all symmetries, but when it leaves some intact, rational credences must respect the residual invariance.\n\n10. Objection: \u201cBut probability-1 events can fail to happen; why should facts of probability-0 dictate certitude?\u201d  \nYou are not asked to be certain that your coin is tails; you are asked for a credence.  If P_F(H)=0, that is a rational degree of belief, not a claim of metaphysical impossibility.  In standard probability theory, assigning probability 0 to an event is compatible with its truth (Lebesgue-almost-everywhere arguments rely on that).  What the argument shows is that rationality forces the credence to 0; it does not show that heads for you is logically impossible.  Indeed, under P_F the event \u201cmy coin is heads\u201d can happen, but it is an event of measure 0 inside a \u03c3-field that already represents maximal information compatible with finitely many heads.\n\n11. Objection: \u201cDoesn\u2019t Kolmogorov\u2019s 0-1 law say tail events have probability 0 or 1?  Why doesn\u2019t it force P_F(H)=1/2?\u201d  \nKolmogorov\u2019s 0-1 law applies to the original product measure P and to events in the tail \u03c3-field (those unchanged by altering finitely many coordinates).  F is a tail event, which is why P(F)=0.  But H is not a tail event; it depends on coordinate 0.  The 0-1 law therefore has nothing to say about P_F(H).\n\n12. Objection: \u201cThe Borel paradox shows that conditioning on measure-zero events is path-dependent.  Why trust the symmetry-based route rather than the independence-based route?\u201d  \nThe Borel paradox warns that different ways of obtaining the same zero-probability information may justify different conditionals.  In our set-up the manner of learning is fully specified: you are told F, full stop.  That information has the described symmetry, and any way of learning it that breaks the symmetry would introduce extra evidence (for instance, being shown a particular cutoff N after which all coins are tails).  Once those extra details are included, the posterior for H can indeed be higher than 0 (for example, if you are told \u201cfrom coin #10,001 onwards all coins are tails,\u201d your own coin\u2019s probability of head is 2^{\u221210,000}).  The lesson reinforces, rather than undermines, our conclusion: update only on what you have actually learned, and respect its symmetries.\n\n13. A final intuitive picture  \nImagine the infinite line of people stretching out to infinity.  A booming voice announces: \u201cOnly finitely many heads!\u201d  What could that world look like?  There must be some last head.  Maybe it occurs at position #12, maybe at #2,087, but there is some finite terminal index N beyond which every coin is a tail.  Now pick any particular person far enough down the line\u2014say #1,000,000.  That person is almost certainly beyond N, hence almost certainly holding tails.  Because your epistemic situation is symmetric with that person's (you do not know your own index, and evidence does not distinguish coins), the same reasoning applies to you.  In the limit of that reasoning\u2014made rigorous above\u2014the \u2018almost certainly\u2019 becomes probability 0 of being a head.\n\n14. Summary of the argument  \n1. Our prior product measure and the evidence F are invariant under all finite permutations of the coin indices.  \n2. Rationality requires the posterior to respect that symmetry (Equivariance).  \n3. Equivariance forces every coin to have the same conditional head-probability q.  \n4. If q > 0 the expected number of heads after conditioning is infinite, contradicting F.  \n5. Therefore q = 0 and P(H | F) = 0.  \n6. Attempts to retain \u00bd must violate symmetry, countable additivity, or conditionalisation; the first is irrational, the second radical, the third Bayesianly unacceptable.  \nHence rational credence that your coin is heads, after learning that only finitely many heads occurred, should be 0.\n\n15. Broader moral  \nThe puzzle dramatises two morals that reach well beyond its toy setting.\n\nFirst, zero-probability evidence can carry real epistemic weight.  Bayesianism handles it by conditionalising with respect to an appropriately symmetric RCP; doing so can change your subjective probabilities dramatically, as here from \u00bd to 0.\n\nSecond, global constraints (here, the scarcity of heads) can swamp local independence.  Independence facts are not sacrosanct; they are defeasible by new information that introduces correlations.  Recognising when that happens\u2014and which symmetries survive the new information\u2014is essential for rational belief revision.\n\nCredence 0 may feel extreme, but extremity is enforced by the same probabilistic machinery that licensed your initial \u00bd.  Fairness is not a magical shield around your coin; like any piece of evidence, it is revisable in the light of global information.  Once you discover that heads are finitely many in an \u03c9-sequence where fairness almost surely produces infinitely many, the honest Bayesian verdict is: \u201cMine isn\u2019t one of them.\u201d", "output_tokens": 5532, "reasoning_tokens": 2240}

(1) I explain why the ordinary Bayesian update rule breaks down when one is asked to condition on probability-zero information, and I motivate a natural repair.  (2) I offer two elementary but powerful symmetry arguments for the thesis.  (3) I derive the 0-answer by an explicit limiting-ratio calculation that makes the intuitive symmetry precise.  (4) I address two objections, one centred on the thought that \u201cI learned nothing about my own coin,\u201d the other on the suspicion that updating on probability-zero events is illegitimate.  (5) I contrast the present verdict with rival regular conditional probability proposals and explain why the rival that yields \u00bd is unstable.  (6) I extract two general morals about self-location and about reasoning in infinitary probability spaces.\n\n1\u2003Why ordinary Bayesian conditionalisation is silent here  \n---------------------------------------------------------  \nClassical Bayesianism tells us to update by conditionalisation:\n\n\u2003Credence_new(H) = Credence_old(H & E) / Credence_old(E)\n\nwhen Credence_old(E) > 0.  In our set-up, however, the event F has unconditional probability 0.  (By the second Borel\u2013Cantelli lemma each individual agent\u2019s coin shows heads infinitely often with probability 1, so Credence_old(F)=0.)  The usual quotient formulation is therefore undefined, and Bayesianism offers us no unique updated distribution.  We need a supplementary norm: a rule for learning probability-zero propositions.\n\nA standard suggestion (Kolmogorov 1950; Blackwell & Dubins 1962) is to approximate F by a nested sequence of positive-probability events F\u2081\u2282F\u2082\u2282\u2026 whose union is F, set conditional probabilities relative to each F_n, and take the limit if it exists.  I shall adopt that rule of thumb, but first some quick intuitive reasoning already points toward the 0-answer.\n\n2\u2003Two quick symmetry arguments  \n------------------------------  \n2.1\u2003The \u201cthin-needle\u201d argument  \nIf only finitely many heads were tossed among countably many coins, then the set of heads is scattered sparsely through an ocean of tails.  Heads are like a finite number of needles in an infinite haystack.  Nothing distinguishes you, agent 0, from agents 57 or 882, except your index\u2014an arbitrary label independent of the outcomes.  Because there are only finitely many needles but infinitely many stalks of hay, the probability that a randomly chosen stalk is a needle should be 0.  Since you have no reason to believe your index is special with respect to the outcomes, you should regard yourself as a \u201crandomly chosen\u201d agent for present purposes; therefore your credence that you are a needle (a head) should be 0.\n\n2.2\u2003The \u201clottery\u201d argument  \nImagine instead that after all coins are tossed an omniscient being writes the indices of heads on slips of paper and places them in an urn.  F tells you that the urn contains only finitely many slips.  Now suppose, purely for the sake of vividness, that you do not know your own index; it will be revealed by drawing one slip uniformly at random from all indices (heads and tails alike).  Under F the urn of heads is finite while the population of slips representing tails is infinite.  A uniform draw from a countable infinity that includes a finite distinguished subset will almost surely miss that subset.  Hence the probability that you find your own index in the urn is 0.  Removing the picturesque disguise leaves the same conclusion for the original problem.\n\nNeither argument pretends to be a formal deduction, but both embody the same probabilistic symmetry: conditional on F, heads are a measure-zero subset of agents.  The next section makes this rigorous.\n\n3\u2003A limiting-ratio calculation  \n------------------------------  \nLet H\u2080 be the event \u201cmy coin is heads.\u201d  Fix any natural number n and let F_n be the event \u201cat most n heads occur in total.\u201d  We have  \n\n\u2003F = \u22c3_{n=0}^{\u221e} F_n\u2003and\u2003F_n\u2191F.\n\nBecause each F_n has positive probability (indeed, extremely tiny but non-zero), ordinary conditionalisation within F_n is legitimate.  Define  \n\n\u2003p_n := Credence_old(H\u2080 | F_n).\n\nWe will show lim_{n\u2192\u221e} p_n = 0, whence the limit-of-approximations rule mandates Credence_new(H\u2080)=0.\n\nComputation.  Write Y for the number of heads among the coins tossed by agents 1,2,3,\u2026 (everyone except you).  Then\n\n\u2003H\u2080 & F_n \u2003\u2261\u2003(H\u2080 & Y \u2264 n \u2013 1).\n\nBy independence,  \n\n\u2003Credence_old(H\u2080 & F_n) = \u00bd \u00b7 P(Y \u2264 n \u2013 1).        (1)\n\nSimilarly,  \n\n\u2003F_n = [T\u2080 & Y \u2264 n] \u222a [H\u2080 & Y \u2264 n \u2013 1],\n\nwhere T\u2080 is the event \u201cmy coin is tails.\u201d  These two subevents are disjoint, hence  \n\n\u2003Credence_old(F_n) = \u00bd\u00b7P(Y \u2264 n) + \u00bd\u00b7P(Y \u2264 n \u2013 1).        (2)\n\nDividing (1) by (2) we obtain  \n\n\u2003p_n = P(Y \u2264 n \u2013 1) / [P(Y \u2264 n) + P(Y \u2264 n \u2013 1)].        (3)\n\nNow observe three facts about Y.\n\na) Y is the sum of countably many i.i.d. Bernoulli(\u00bd) variables, so Y=\u221e with probability 1.  \nb) Hence for every fixed n, P(Y \u2264 n)=0.  \nc) Nevertheless P(Y \u2264 n) is not identically zero inside finite truncations; rather it tends to 0 extremely fast.\n\nFrom (b) we immediately have P(Y \u2264 n)=P(Y \u2264 n \u2013 1)=0, and hence the ratio in (3) takes the indeterminate form 0/0.  To break the tie we use finite-population truncations.  Consider the first m other agents and let Y_m be the number of heads among them.  Define p_{n,m} analogously:\n\n\u2003p_{n,m} := P(H\u2080 | H\u2080 \u222a T\u2080 together with Y_m \u2264 n) = (\u00bd\u00b7P(Y_m \u2264 n \u2013 1)) / (\u00bd\u00b7P(Y_m \u2264 n) + \u00bd\u00b7P(Y_m \u2264 n \u2013 1)).\n\nFor each fixed m the underlying distribution is binomial, so P(Y_m \u2264 n) > 0 whenever n \u2265 0.  Elementary algebra gives  \n\n\u2003p_{n,m} = P(Y_m \u2264 n \u2013 1) / [P(Y_m \u2264 n) + P(Y_m \u2264 n \u2013 1)] \u2264 P(Y_m \u2264 n) / P(Y_m \u2264 n) = 1.\n\nMore importantly, for fixed n we have lim_{m\u2192\u221e} P(Y_m \u2264 n)=0; that is, tails will almost surely swamp heads as we consider larger and larger prefixes only if n grows with m.  A standard \u03b5-\u03b4 argument then shows lim_{m\u2192\u221e} p_{n,m}=0 for every n.  Since p_n := lim_{m\u2192\u221e} p_{n,m}, we obtain p_n=0.  Finally, lim_{n\u2192\u221e} p_n=0, establishing the announced result.\n\nIntuitively the calculation says: if you are told that at most n heads occurred altogether, and you let the population of tossed coins grow without bound, the chance that you are one of those \u2264 n special heads shrinks to 0, no matter how large n is.  Learning only that the actual number of heads is finite offers no refuge.\n\n4\u2003Two objections answered  \n-------------------------  \nObjection 1: \u201cBut F tells me nothing about my own coin.  Why shouldn\u2019t my personal credence stay at \u00bd?\u201d\n\nReply.  F does not single out your coin, but it does create a global correlation.  Think of a simplified variant with only three agents A, B, C who toss fair coins and are then told: \u201cExactly one coin landed heads.\u201d  Each coin is still fair in isolation, yet every agent who accepts the announcement should assign credence 1\u20443, not \u00bd, to her own coin\u2019s being heads.  The reason is simple: exactly one of the three coins can be heads, and symmetry dictates equal chances that it is each of A, B, or C.  Our infinite case merely pushes the same logic farther: \u201cexactly finitely many heads\u201d instead of \u201cexactly one.\u201d  When the distinguished subset shrinks to measure zero, the personal credence shrinks to 0.\n\nObjection 2: \u201cUpdating on probability-zero events is illegitimate.  Better to ignore F as a hallucination.\u201d\n\nReply.  In ordinary life we do sometimes learn things that had prior probability 0: a perfectly precise real-number measurement, an unexpected theorem that falsifies a mathematical conjecture we had taken to be necessarily true, and so on.  Bayesian epistemology does not tell us to discard such information; it tells us to refine our prior or supply a conditional distribution that respects the new evidence.  In the present problem F is stipulated as fact, so any adequate epistemic rule must yield a determinate posterior.  The limit-of-approximations method, defended above, does just that and points to credence 0.  Ignoring the evidence is not rational change; it is refusal to update.\n\n5\u2003Why some rival proposals say \u00bd and why they fail  \n---------------------------------------------------  \nA number of philosophers (e.g. H\u00e1jek 2003 on analogous examples) have proposed supplementing Bayesianism with a \u201cprincipal principle\u201d for conditioning on events of probability 0: simply retain the original conditional probability P(H\u2080 | information about other coins only), which by independence is \u00bd.  Formally, one chooses a *regular conditional probability* P*(H\u2080 | \u03c3(Y)), where \u03c3(Y) is the \u03c3-algebra generated by all other agents\u2019 coins.  Because H\u2080 is independent of \u03c3(Y), one obtains P* = \u00bd almost surely, even on the zero-probability realisation Y=finite.\n\nThe difficulty is that regular conditional probabilities are not unique on measure-zero sets; different versions agree almost everywhere but can disagree on precisely those outcomes we now learn have obtained.  The \u00bd-answer therefore hangs on an arbitrary choice.  A rival version is obtained by taking limits along the approximating events F_n, yielding the 0-answer.  Since both are mathematically permissible, which should an epistemic norm favour?\n\nThree considerations tilt decisively toward the 0-version.\n\nFirst, *conglomerability*.  An updating rule should not assign higher probability to an event than every member of a partition does.  But the \u00bd-rule violates conglomerability relative to the partition {H\u2080, T\u2080}: conditioning on F yields P(H\u2080)=\u00bd even though conditioning further on T\u2080\u2227F forces P(H\u2080)=0.  The limit-version respects conglomerability.\n\nSecond, *countable additivity of epistemic value*.  A rule that assigns each individual agent probability 0 of being heads but still allows that finitely many heads exist produces no tension; by contrast, the \u00bd-rule implies that the expected number of heads conditional on F is infinite (countably many agents each with probability \u00bd), contradicting F itself.\n\nThird, *diachronic stability.*  Suppose you first learn that at most 10^{100} heads occurred and update by ordinary conditionalisation (getting a credence astronomically close to 0), and only later learn that in fact the number was merely finite.  A good updating rule should let you incorporate the second piece of information without jumping back up to \u00bd.  The limit-rule has this property; the independence-rule does not.\n\nFor these reasons the \u00bd-answer is epistemically unstable.  The 0-answer, derived by the limit-of-approximations method, survives all of the pressures just reviewed.\n\n6\u2003Two morals  \n-------------  \n(1) *Self-locating probability in infinite spaces.*  Even when no qualitative information singles me out, purely quantitative constraints on the global pattern of outcomes can make it virtually impossible that I occupy one of the scarce \u201cspecial\u201d positions.  The present case is an extreme instance: a finite number of heads distributed among infinitely many agents.  The moral generalises: if the property in question has measure zero among locations compatible with your evidence, and if you have no evidence that distinguishes your own location, then rational self-locating credence in possessing that property should be 0.\n\n(2) *Learning the impossible.*  Epistemology must accommodate the possibility of probability-zero learning.  Doing so inevitably forces us to make *extra-Kolmogorovian* choices about how to extend conditional probabilities.  Pure independence is not enough: one must examine how the zero-probability information constrains the joint distribution.  In the present problem the constraints slash the support of your credence function so drastically that they eliminate every world in which *infinitely* many heads occur.  What remains assigns you, a single labelled agent, negligible chance of being among the finite heads.  The correct response is to let your personal credence collapse to 0.\n\nConclusion  \n----------  \nReceiving the announcement F is epistemically dramatic.  Because any world in which infinitely many heads occur is now off the table, the set of heads becomes a scattered finite speck in an endless sea of tails.  Symmetry\u2014epistemic indifference among agents\u2014therefore mandates that you regard yourself as almost surely a tail.  More rigorous limiting calculations confirm the informal symmetry, and attempts to preserve the old \u00bd-credence collapse under scrutiny.  Rationality in the face of a measure-zero miracle thus requires extreme humility: the chance that *your* coin is one of the exceptional heads is 0.", "output_tokens": 5201, "reasoning_tokens": 1984}

Stating the problem\n\nImagine a fair coin in your hand, and imagine that exactly the same kind of coin is being flipped\u2014independently and fairly\u2014by every other member of a countably infinite collection of people. None of you look at the outcomes. An experimenter then announces a jaw\u2013dropping result: \u201cOut of all the infinitely many coins, only finitely many landed heads.\u201d Call that announcement F. Learning F forces you to make a dramatic revision in your picture of how the overall sequence of coin tosses turned out. But ought it to change your personal credence that your own coin landed heads? Two answers look tempting:\n\nHalf-hearted: \u201cNo. My coin is still fair and independent. Its chance of heads is \u00bd.\u201d\n\nRadical: \u201cYes. Given that only finitely many heads occurred, the odds that mine is one of them are vanishingly small. My credence should drop to 0.\u201d\n\nI shall defend the radical answer. More precisely, after conditioning on F a rational agent should adopt credence 0 that her coin landed heads. On reflection, the half-hearted answer rests on a misunderstanding of independence and on a failure to confront the special troubles that arise whenever we update on an event of probability 0. \n\nThe argument proceeds in four stages. \n\n(1) I clarify how Bayesian conditionalisation behaves when the evidence has zero prior probability and why extra principles must be invoked.  \n(2) I motivate a pair of constraints\u2014Exchangeability Preservation and Countable Additivity\u2014that any sane way of conditioning on F ought to respect.  \n(3) I prove that the only way to satisfy those constraints is to assign conditional probability 0 to the hypothesis that one\u2019s own coin is heads.  \n(4) I rebut three objections: (a) the appeal to prior independence, (b) a proposal that leaves credence at \u00bd by exploiting the freedom inherent in conditioning on null events, and (c) a \u201cskeptical\u201d response that says no rational credence is definable at all in this case.\n\n2. Conditioning on an event of probability 0\n\nOrdinary Bayesian updating is easy when one learns some evidence E that had positive prior probability. One simply divides:  \nPnew(A)=Pold(A & E)/Pold(E).\n\nBut if Pold(E)=0 the ratio is undefined. Classical measure-theoretic probability supplies a replacement notion: a regular conditional probability, obtained by approximating E with a sequence of measurable sets of positive probability (or equivalently via the Radon\u2013Nikod\u00fdm derivative). A key point\u2014and the source of the present puzzle\u2014is that the conditional measure is no longer unique once we condition on a null set. Extra normative criteria have to be supplied.\n\nPhilosophers sometimes treat this indeterminacy as a license to leave credences unaltered. I shall argue instead that the indeterminacy can be removed by appealing to structural features already implicit in the initial problem\u2014above all, exchangeability and finite additivity. When those features are respected, the radical answer follows.\n\n3. Two structural constraints\n\n3.1 Exchangeability Preservation (EP)\n\nUnconditionally, the sequence of coin flips \u27e8X1,X2, \u2026\u27e9 is exchangeable: any finite permutation of the indices yields a probability-equivalent sequence. A datum concerning how many heads occurred, but not which individuals were responsible for them, should not break that symmetry between persons. Formally:\n\nEP.  For any i, j,   Pnew(Xi=1 | F) = Pnew(Xj=1 | F).\n\n3.2 Countable Additivity for Expected Heads (CA)\n\nLet H=\u03a3i Xi be the random variable counting total heads. F informs us that H is some finite integer. Whatever updated credence we adopt, the conditional expectation of H must therefore be finite:\n\nEnew(H | F) < \u221e.\n\nBecause expected value is the countable sum of individual expectations, we have\n\nEnew(H | F) = \u03a3i Pnew(Xi=1 | F).\n\nHence CA.  The series \u03a3i Pnew(Xi=1 | F) converges (i.e. its sum is finite).\n\n4. Deriving the radical answer\n\nSuppose toward contradiction that, conditional on F, your credence that your coin shows heads is some positive real number \u03b5>0. By EP the same \u03b5 applies to every other person. But then CA is violated, because \u03a3i \u03b5 diverges: adding \u03b5 to itself countably many times yields infinity. So \u03b5 must be zero. Since \u201cyour coin\u201d was arbitrary, every individual\u2019s conditional probability of heads is 0.\n\nRationality therefore demands that, upon learning F, you become certain that your own coin came up tails. Q.E.D.\n\nThe argument is disarmingly short, yet deserves a few remarks.\n\n(i) The derivation did not presuppose that you are \u2018randomly selected\u2019 from the population. It relied only on the anonymity of persons built into exchangeability.  \n\n(ii) What we really showed is that any regular conditional probability that simultaneously respects EP and CA assigns probability 0 to each individual head. There exist other regular conditionals, but I shall next argue that they are normatively inappropriate.\n\n5. Why \u2018\u00bd\u2019 looks tempting\u2014and why it fails\n\nObjection 1 (Independence).  \u201cMy coin is independent of the rest; F only mentions the rest; therefore my probability remains \u00bd.\u201d\n\nReply.  Independence is a two-place relation holding between random variables relative to a probability measure. Changing the measure can destroy the independence. Indeed, in the conditional measure given F, variables are massively dependent: the event that infinitely many others landed tails makes it overwhelmingly likely that you did too. Independence cannot be \u2018imported\u2019 unaltered across conditionalisation.\n\nA quick finite analogue exposes the mistake. Let 100 people each toss a fair coin. You hear that at most 1 head occurred. That information is explicitly about the whole group, yet it certainly slashes the chance that yours is heads\u2014from \u00bd down to 1/100. Most people trust their intuitions about 100\u037e the paradox arises only when they extrapolate na\u00efvely to countable infinity.\n\n6. Three rival strategies and what\u2019s wrong with them\n\n6.1 The \u2018stick-with-\u00bd\u2019 strategy via exotic conditional measures\n\nBecause conditioning on a null set is non-unique, one can explicitly construct a Radon\u2013Nikod\u00fdm derivative that leaves individual heads at \u00bd even after learning F. The construction chooses, for every outcome compatible with F, a probability weight inversely proportional to 2H, with H the finite number of heads that actually occurred. In that weighting scheme the expected total heads is infinite, even though each realised outcome has finitely many heads. Hence CA fails. That is exactly what went wrong: retaining \u00bd forces us to abandon countable additivity of expectations, a price classical probability refuses to pay.\n\n6.2 The super-regularisation maneuver\n\nAnother dodge appeals to non-standard analysis: represent the original coin flips on a hyper-finite probability space of N coins, take N to be an unlimited hyper-integer, condition on \u2018only finitely many heads\u2019 (which now has positive yet infinitesimal probability), and transfer back. The resulting conditional credence of heads for any given coin is an infinitesimal \u03b4>0 rather than exactly zero. But \u03b4 still violates EP+CA once we return to the standard world, because \u03b4N is still infinite. The infinitesimal wash-out leaves us with the same verdict: in the standard \u03c3-additive framework, probability must go all the way to 0.\n\n6.3 Skepticism: \u201cNo determinate credence is rationally mandated\u201d\n\nA different family of objections concedes the technical point but draws skeptical or permissive conclusions: because null-event conditioning is underdetermined, rationality leaves credence unconstrained. Yet appeal to structural constraints EP and CA shows otherwise. Those constraints are not optional; they are inherited from the uncontroversial symmetries and axioms of the prior measure. Once we respect them, indeterminacy vanishes. Skepticism therefore gives up too soon.\n\n7. Extended comparisons and deeper morals\n\n7.1 Finite truncations\n\nOne can approximate the infinite scenario by its first N participants. Let FN be the event \u201cno more than N heads occurred among all countably many tosses.\u201d Because the infinite \u2018tail\u2019 of tosses after the first N is still infinite, FN retains probability 0, but we can ask instead about the finite event GN: \u201camong the first N tosses at most N\u00bd landed heads.\u201d On GN (whose probability is astronomically small but positive) the conditional chance that the first toss is heads is at most N\u00bd/N = 1/\u221aN. Letting N grow drives that conditional chance to 0. The infinite case is the limiting point of the finite cases; the radical answer is continuous under that limiting process, whereas the half-hearted answer would require a discontinuous jump back to \u00bd when one passes to actual infinity. Continuity thus supports the radical view.\n\n7.2 Relation to the Kolmogorov 0-1 law\n\nThe event F is a \u2018tail event\u2019: its truth value depends only on the eventual behaviour of the sequence, not on any finite initial segment. The Kolmogorov 0-1 law tells us that every tail event for an i.i.d. sequence has probability 0 or 1. So F\u2019s probability is 0. In the measure\u2010theoretic tradition, all tail events lie in the tail \u03c3-algebra, and conditional probabilities with respect to that \u03c3-algebra are almost surely constant. Roughly speaking, no finite information can shift the probability of a tail event. The present puzzle is the converse: we are trying to shift beliefs about finite events (your individual toss) by conditioning on a tail event. Kolmogorov\u2019s theorem provides no obstacle to doing so; what it emphasizes is that F injects global information that can swamp local independence.\n\n7.3 Lessons for anthropic reasoning\n\nPhilosophers of cosmology debate whether discovering that one is \u2018typical\u2019 among a huge ensemble affects ordinary hypotheses about local physics. The coin-flip problem is a toy model: learning that almost everyone got tails makes it rational to believe that you did too, even though before hearing F you assigned equal likelihood to heads and tails. The revision is forced by the demand that you locate yourself in a world that \u2018mostly looks one way,\u2019 a structural echo of the Self-Indication Assumption\u2019s conflict with the Self-Sampling Assumption in observer-selection theory. The example therefore warns that global information can rationally swamp priors about local chancy events.\n\n7.4 Does the argument depend on countable infinity?\n\nYes. For any finite population N, conditionalising on \u201conly finitely many (\u2264k) heads occurred\u201d can leave you with a small but non-zero probability k/N that your coin is one of the heads. As N\u2192\u221e with k fixed, that probability sinks to 0. The discontinuity between finite N and countably infinite N is conceptually acceptable once one remembers that countable additivity, not merely finite additivity, is an axiom of Kolmogorov probability. What was \u2018small\u2019 in every finite case becomes literally 0 in the limit.\n\n8. Philosophical wrap-up\n\nWhy did the half-hearted answer feel so plausible? Two cognitive heuristics conspire.\n\n(i) Localism: we think of independence as a local fact, forgetting that conditionalising on global information can forge new dependencies.  \n(ii) Regularity bias: we are unused to updating on probability-0 events, so we substitute the nearest regular event\u2014something like \u201cvery few heads occurred\u201d\u2014and rely on an illicit analogue.\n\nIn the present set-up those heuristics mislead. Explicit calculation, together with structural principles that no Bayesian would wish to abandon, force a deterministic conclusion: your credence in heads should drop to 0.\n\n9. Conclusion\n\nLearning that only finitely many heads were tossed in an infinite fair sequence is logically possible though probabilistically impossible. If it happens, you enter territory where ordinary Bayesian division breaks down. Still, the resources of classical probability\u2014exchangeability, countable additivity, and the theory of regular conditional measures\u2014yield a firm verdict. Any updating that respects those resources must assign conditional probability 0 to the hypothesis that your own coin landed heads. The radical answer is therefore correct: your credence ought to shift from \u00bd to 0.\n\nThat conclusion simultaneously resolves the puzzle and illustrates a general lesson. In infinite settings, global information about what happens \u2018almost everywhere\u2019 can rationally overturn seemingly rock-solid local probabilities. Independence is fragile, and probability-zero updates are dangerous but manageable, provided one keeps track of the structural commitments built into one\u2019s prior.", "output_tokens": 4593, "reasoning_tokens": 1856}

The fact that \u201conly finitely many heads occurred\u201d is a global, collective fact; it does not discriminate among the individuals. So shouldn\u2019t your credence remain at \u00bd?  \n\nRarity Pull. Learning that there are only finitely many heads is tantamount to learning that heads are extraordinarily rare\u2014indeed, there are infinitely many tails. Given that you are just one among infinitely many tossers, the chance that you belong to the rare, finite set should be 0. So shouldn\u2019t your credence fall to 0 (or at least become infinitesimal)?  \n\nMy thesis is that the second pull is correct: once you are certain that only finitely many heads occurred, the rational credence that your own coin is a head is 0. The independence argument breaks down in the infinite setting because of a clash between symmetry and countable additivity, and because conditioning on a probability-zero event must be handled via limits rather than by the elementary quotient rule.\n\nThe route to that verdict proceeds in four steps.  \n(1)  We make precise what it means to conditionalise on a probability-zero event.  \n(2)  We derive, by a very short symmetry argument, that conditional on \u201cat most n heads\u201d (a probability-positive event), every individual coin has conditional probability 0 of being heads.  \n(3)  Taking the limit n \u2192 \u221e produces the sought conditional probability given \u201conly finitely many heads\u201d.  \n(4)  We rebut the independence argument, diagnose the seductive mistake, and draw some more general lessons about updating in infinite contexts.\n\n2. Conditionalising on measure-zero events  \nBayesian conditionalisation, in its textbook form,\n\nP(A | E) = P(A \u2227 E)/P(E),\n\nrequires P(E) > 0. Because the probability that a countable infinity of fair coins yields only finitely many heads is 0 (Kolmogorov\u2019s 0-1 law), ordinary conditionalisation breaks down. There are two respectable ways to proceed:\n\nMethod of limits.  Choose an increasing sequence (E\u2081, E\u2082, E\u2083,\u2026) of events of positive probability whose union is E, and define\n\nP(A || E) := lim\u2096\u2192\u221e P(A | E\u2096),\n\nprovided the limit exists and is independent of the approximating sequence.  \n(Here \u201c||\u201d signals a conditional probability obtained by such a limit.)\n\nRegular conditional probabilities.  Kolmogorov\u2019s theory guarantees that for many probability spaces there exists a conditional probability function defined on all measurable events, including those of measure 0, that extends the finite-case quotient rule and respects countable additivity. On the present coin-toss space, a regular conditional probability can be defined via the method of limits just described, and it is unique almost everywhere.\n\nI shall work with the family of approximations\n\nE\u2099 := {the total number of heads in the whole sequence is \u2264 n}\n\n(n = 0,1,2,\u2026).  Each E\u2099 has probability\n\nP(E\u2099) = \u2211_{k=0}^{n} P(total heads = k),\n\nwhich, although tiny for even modest n, is strictly positive. Moreover, \u22c3\u2099 E\u2099 = E (fin-heads).\n\nIf the conditional probabilities P(H | E\u2099) converge, the method of limits supplies the unique regular conditional probability of H given E.\n\n3. The crucial symmetry-additivity argument  \nLet H\u1d62 be the indicator variable for the i-th coin\u2019s landing heads.\n\nLemma.  For every n, P(H\u1d62 | E\u2099) = 0.\n\nProof.  The event E\u2099 is permutation-symmetric: exchanging the labels of any two agents leaves the event intact because E\u2099 depends only on the total number of heads, not on their locations. Hence for any i and j, P(H\u1d62 | E\u2099) = P(H\u2c7c | E\u2099).  Call this common value p\u2099.\n\nBy Tonelli\u2019s theorem, non-negative random variables permit the interchange of expectation and infinite summation:\n\nE(\u03a3\u1d62 H\u1d62 | E\u2099) = \u03a3\u1d62 E(H\u1d62 | E\u2099) = \u03a3\u1d62 p\u2099.\n\nBut by definition of E\u2099, the total number of heads does not exceed n, so the conditional expectation of that total is \u2264 n. Therefore\n\n\u03a3\u1d62 p\u2099 \u2264 n.\n\nIf p\u2099 > 0, the left-hand side diverges to \u221e because there are countably many summands. Contradiction. Hence p\u2099 = 0. \u220e\n\nCorollaries.  \n(a) For each finite n, given that at most n heads occurred, every individual coin is almost surely a tail.  \n(b) The method-of-limits conditional probability is\n\nP(H\u1d62 || E) = lim\u2099\u2192\u221e P(H\u1d62 | E\u2099) = 0.\n\nIn particular, your credence in (H) should collapse from \u00bd to 0 once you become certain that only finitely many heads occurred.\n\nIntuitively: the only way finitely many heads can arise is if heads are not merely rare but almost nonexistent. The whole conditional probability mass is concentrated on sequences in which the vast majority\u2014indeed all but finitely many\u2014specific positions carry tails. Symmetry then forces each labelled position, including yours, to have (conditional) probability zero of being in the tiny exceptional set.\n\n4. Does this clash with independence?  \nAt first glance the result is astonishing. After all, your coin is physically independent of what happened in the other infinitely many trials; we stipulated genuine fairness. Yet the inference that \u201cmy credence remains \u00bd\u201d trades on an illicit step: it assumes that the global information E is independent of the result of my particular coin, and that therefore\n\nP(H | E) = P(H) = \u00bd.\n\nBut E is not independent of H. E says something about the total number of heads, and that total includes mine. If my coin is heads, it nudges the total up by one; if it is tails, it does not. In a finite case that \u201cnudge\u201d would be marginal, but still strictly positive. In the infinite case the nudge is not small but catastrophic: if one tries to cram infinitely many symmetric positive numbers into a finite expected total, one must squeeze each of them down to 0. So the dependence manifests itself in an all-or-nothing way.\n\nThe deeper moral is that independence behaves treacherously in infinite settings. Local, pairwise independence does not entail independence of a local variable from a global constraint that aggregates infinitely many local outcomes. The usual slogan \u201cconditioning just deletes the possibilities incompatible with the evidence, then renormalises\u201d works only if renormalisation is possible\u2014here it is forced to drive the head-probabilities to zero in order to keep the infinite sum finite.\n\n5. A check by explicit calculation  \nReaders may nevertheless want to see the phenomenon algebraically. Begin with the conditional probability under E\u2099:\n\nP(H\u2081 | E\u2099) = P(H\u2081 \u2227 S \u2264 n \u2212 1) / P(S + H\u2081 \u2264 n),\n\nwhere S = H\u2082 + H\u2083 + \u2026 is the number of heads among the remaining coins.\n\nBecause H\u2081 is independent of S and takes value 1 with prior probability \u00bd,\n\nP(H\u2081 \u2227 S \u2264 n \u2212 1) = \u00bd\u00b7P(S \u2264 n \u2212 1).\n\nBut P(S \u2264 n) \u2265 \u00bd\u00b7P(S \u2264 n \u2212 1) (simply require that coin 2 be tails). Therefore\n\nP(H\u2081 | E\u2099) \u2264 (\u00bd\u00b7P(S \u2264 n \u2212 1)) / (\u00bd\u00b7P(S \u2264 n \u2212 1)) = 1.\n\nThis trivial upper bound is useless, yet we can iterate the argument across more coins to tighten it indefinitely. Using permutation symmetry of the E\u2099, each of the first m distinct coins contributes at most an equal share to the permitted n heads, whence\n\nP(at least one of coins 1,\u2026,m is heads | E\u2099) \u2264 n/m.\n\nLetting m \u2192 \u221e forces this probability, and hence P(H\u2081 | E\u2099), to 0. The limit argument is exactly the informal one given above: dividing finitely many heads among infinitely many labelled positions gives each position probability zero of hosting a head.\n\n6. Objections and replies  \nObjection 1 (\u201csurely probability zero is not the same as impossibility\u201d).  Quite so: probability zero events can occur, and by stipulation we now know one has. The present result claims only that, conditional on that occurrence, the probability of your coin being a head is zero. That is compatible with your coin being a head\u2014there will in fact be finitely many heads in the room\u2014but it would be epistemically reckless to bet on being one of them.\n\nObjection 2 (\u201ccountable additivity is too strong; why not relax it?\u201d).  Some finitists and subjectivists would indeed question countable additivity and thereby resist the symmetry argument. But doing so is costly. Countable additivity underwrites the Dutch Book theorem for countably many bets, the Kolmogorov 0-1 law, and virtually every continuity property of probabilities over infinite sequences. Jettisoning it leaves us unable to assign coherent expectations to many limit events. Few Bayesians are prepared to pay that price.\n\nObjection 3 (\u201cwhat if my own label is special?\u201d).  You might protest that you knew all along that you were agent #1, and that symmetry considerations about anonymous positions therefore do not apply. Yet the argument did not rely on anonymity. All it used is that E\u2099 does not privilege any particular index. Given E\u2099, coin #1 is in exactly the same epistemic boat as coin #2, coin #572, or any other. Label knowledge does not break that symmetry.\n\nObjection 4 (\u201cregular conditional probabilities are not unique everywhere\u201d).  True, they are unique only up to events of measure zero, but the event in question\u2014there being finitely many heads\u2014has exactly probability zero. Uniqueness therefore does not strictly apply. Even so, the method-of-limits procedure is canonical; any rival conditional probability that (i) preserves permutation symmetry and (ii) assigns the total number of heads \u2264 n almost surely when conditioned on E\u2099, must converge to the same result. If one adopted a wildly non-standard regular conditional that assigned, say, probability \u00bd to H given E, one would incur a violation of symmetry or of countable additivity.\n\n7. What about infinitesimal probabilities?  \nOne might prefer to work in a non-Archimedean probability calculus in which P(E) is not 0 but an infinitesimal \u03b5. Conditioning in that framework yields\n\nP(H | E) = P(H\u2227E)/P(E) = (\u00bd\u03b5)/\u03b5 = \u00bd.\n\nHowever, that calculation smuggles in the assumption that H and E are independent up to first order in \u03b5\u2014precisely the independence that fails in the standard framework. A careful non-Archimedean treatment still confronts the constraint that the expected total number of heads, conditional on E, must be finite; the only way to satisfy it without breaking symmetry is to assign an infinitesimal probability to each individual head. In other words, P(H | E) would be not \u00bd but an infinitesimal of the same order as \u03b5. The qualitative verdict (credence collapses) survives.\n\n8. Wider morals  \n(i)  Local fairness does not guarantee unaltered local credences once global constraints are learned. Global information can couple previously independent local variables in strong, sometimes discontinuous, ways.  \n\n(ii)  Probability-zero events are epistemically potent. Bayesian orthodoxy must supplement the quotient rule with a principled account of conditionalisation by limits. The present case supplies a vivid illustration: two sequences of approximating events (at-most-n-heads vs. at-most-n-tails) can lead to distinct conditionals if the limiting event lacks internal symmetries.  \n\n(iii)  Infinite contexts are fertile breeding grounds for tension between symmetry and additivity. Exactly the same tension underlies Borel\u2019s paradox, Bertrand\u2019s paradox, and the non-measurable uniform distribution over \u2115. The cure is not to abandon additivity or to deny symmetry; it is to recognise that updating on global constraints frequently annihilates local probabilities.\n\n9. Conclusion  \nThe tempting \u201cindependence\u201d reaction overlooks the way in which your toss is woven into the collective fact you have learned. Once you know that only finitely many heads occurred, symmetry and countable additivity force the conditional probability that any particular labelled coin (yours included) is a head to collapse to 0. The moral extends beyond this toy scenario: evidence about global structure can rationally drive local credences to extreme values, even when the underlying physical processes are independent and fair. In finite worlds that influence is gradual; in infinite worlds, it can be absolute.", "output_tokens": 6710, "reasoning_tokens": 3648}

What, if anything, should that remarkable disclosure do to your confidence that your own coin is one of the lucky few?\n\nThe case forces together three volatile ingredients: (i) probabilistic conditioning on an event of probability 0, (ii) the difference between being a randomly selected coin and being a previously designated coin, and (iii) a clash between two competing inductive principles\u2014symmetry (which suggests \u201cstick with \u00bd\u201d) and frequency (which cries out \u201cheads are vanishingly rare\u2014bet on tails\u201d).  Philosophers have used the puzzle to motivate each of three positions:\n\nA. No Update: rational credence stays at \u00bd.  \nB. Total Update: rational credence collapses to 0.  \nC. Indeterminacy: no single precise update is mandated.\n\nI shall argue for B\u2014the 0-credence answer\u2014but only after carefully clarifying what the question permits us to condition on, and why the two rival lines of thought do not in fact have equal standing once those clarifications are in place.  Along the way we shall see why the problem is a philosophical, not merely mathematical, one: mathematics tells us that ordinary conditional probability breaks down, but philosophy must decide which repair is rationally compulsory.\n\n1.  Framing the problem\n\nLet \u03a9 be the set of all (countably infinite) sequences of coin toss outcomes \u03c9 = (\u03c9\u2080, \u03c9\u2081, \u03c9\u2082, \u2026), with \u03c9\u1d62 \u2208 {H, T}.  The product measure \u03bc gives every finite pattern the familiar 2^{-k} probability.  The random variables H\u1d62(\u03c9) = 1 if \u03c9\u1d62 = H, 0 otherwise, are i.i.d. with expectation \u00bd.  The \u03c3-algebra is the usual product \u03c3-algebra.  \n\nDefine FIN  :=  {\u03c9 : \u03a3\u1d62 H\u1d62(\u03c9) is finite}.  Standard results tell us \u03bc(FIN)=0; almost every sequence has infinitely many heads and infinitely many tails.  We learn that the actual world \u03c9* lies in FIN.  Our epistemic update must therefore be some conditional credence \u03bc*(\u00b7)= \u03bc(\u00b7 | FIN).  But conditioning on a measure-0 set is not uniquely defined.  Kolmogorov\u2019s axioms remain silent; what counts as \u201crational\u201d must be argued for.\n\n2.  Why the symmetry-based \u00bd answer is tempting\n\nTake any finite family of tosses.  Because the original measure is exchangeable, each individual coin has prior probability \u00bd of landing heads, and that probability seems insensitive to what happens far away in the sequence: my toss was causally and probabilistically independent of the rest.  So, one might say, information strictly about the total number of heads among the others should be \u201cscreened off\u201d from my own outcome.  \u201cMy coin was flipped fairly; nothing you told me about all the other flips changes the physical propensity of my coin to land heads.\u201d  That thought motivates A.\n\nThe move can be bolstered by two technical facts.\n\n(i) A regular conditional distribution exists that assigns \u03bc*(H\u1d62)=\u00bd for every i\u2208\u2115.  Pick any enumeration e\u2081,e\u2082,\u2026 of the heads in \u03c9*.  Condition not on FIN itself but on the more specific event HE\u2081\u2099 that \u201cexactly e\u2081,\u2026,e\u2099 are heads and everybody else up to position n is tails.\u201d  Each HE\u2081\u2099 has positive measure, so classical conditioning is defined, and it fixes the i-th marginal at \u00bd as long as i>e\u2099.  A limiting argument then yields a version of \u03bc*(\u00b7) under which \u03bc*(H\u1d62)=\u00bd for all i.  \n\n(ii) This \u00bd-preserving conditional is, moreover, product-like: under it the H\u1d62 are still mutually independent.  If one\u2019s guiding norm is to preserve as much of the prior structure as possible, that seems an attractive proposal.\n\nYet something feels off.  After all, we have just learned that only finitely many heads occurred.  In worlds of that kind, heads are not merely sparse; they have density 0.  If I randomly choose one of the countably many positions, almost surely I will hit a tail.  Is it really rational to shrug that off?\n\n3.  The finite-analogue argument for updating to 0\n\nImagine instead a finite room with N people.  Everyone flips a fair coin.  You are told there are at most n heads in total (n \u226a N).  Straightforward combinatorics yields\n\nP(H\u2080 | \u2264n heads) = n / N.\n\nAs N grows without bound while n stays fixed, the conditional probability that your own coin is heads plunges to 0.  The remarkable fact in the infinite case is exactly the n-fixed aspect: \u201cthere are at most finitely many heads\u201d puts an absolute cap.  The finite-analogue therefore pressures us toward B: what we witness in the limit is the probability contracting to 0.\n\n4.  The random-sample principle\n\nAnother way to see the force of that limit is through the random-sample principle (Sometimes called the \u201cSampling Frequency principle\u201d): If you know that objects of type A make up proportion q of a countably infinite population, and you have no evidence that singles you out as special with respect to A, then\u2014conditionally on that information\u2014your credence that you yourself are an A should be q.\n\nIn worlds in FIN, the limiting proportion of heads to tails is q = 0.  I am one of the coins.  Nothing in the evidence indicates that my coin was treated differently or that I was selected because I happened to be or not be a head.  Random-sample reasoning therefore yields credence 0.\n\nWhy might one doubt the applicability of the principle?  Because unlike the finite-case, in the infinite case \u201cproportion 0\u201d coexists with \u201cinfinitely many tails but finitely many heads.\u201d  It is compatible with there being, say, seven heads.  Someone has to be those seven.  Could I not be one of them?  Of course I could\u2014but the principle is about rational credence, not metaphysical possibility.  Given only that finitely many positions enjoy property H, the probability that a fixed, antecedently specified position is among them is 0.\n\n5.  Regularity, the Borel paradox, and why the 0-conditional is not uniquely forced by mathematics\n\nBecause \u03bc(FIN)=0, conditional probabilities are version-dependent.  Different limiting sequences of positive-measure events can produce different conditionals, the classic Borel paradox.  We already exhibited one version delivering \u03bc*(H\u1d62)=\u00bd.  The finite-analogue suggests another that assigns \u03bc*(H\u1d62)=0.  Mathematically nothing privileges one over the other.  Hence position C: the update is underdetermined.\n\nBut philosophy must decide what counts as *epistemically* appropriate.  The leading proposal in the literature is David Lewis\u2019s Imaging or Bas van Fraassen\u2019s Rejection of Conditionalization on zero-measure events.  I favour a more modest stance: a version is epistemically privileged iff it is the pointwise limit of *natural informative approximations of the evidence*.  And here \u201cthere are at most n heads\u201d is the obvious informative approximation of \u201cthere are finitely many heads.\u201d  Under those approximations, as we saw, credence \u2192 0.\n\nContrast the approximations that keep \u03bc*(H\u1d62)=\u00bd.  They require specifying in advance which finitely many indices are allowed to be heads.  But we were not told that information; indeed, being told it would destroy the anonymity that makes the puzzle interesting.  Those artificial approximations therefore smuggle in illicit extra data and so are not epistemically acceptable.  Once we restrict attention to approximations faithful to the bare content of the evidence, the 0-update stands out as the unique limit.\n\n6.  Objections and replies\n\nObjection 1: \u201cCausal Independence\u201d  \nMy coin was *physically* independent of the others.  Learning about them cannot tune the causal propensity of my coin; surely the best predictor of a fair-coin toss remains \u00bd.\n\nReply: We are not revising the physical propensity.  We are updating epistemic credence in light of new information.  Learning that a fair coin landed heads does not change the physical chance that an independent fair coin will also land heads, but it does change a rational agent\u2019s belief about coins whose results they have reason to think could be correlated.  Here, the *event of being among the finitely many heads* is not independent of the rest of the sequence; indeed it is strongly anti-correlated\u2014only finitely many can satisfy it.  So evidence about the rest legitimately influences credence about me, not by altering the propensity but by altering the reference class I take myself to belong to.\n\nObjection 2: \u201cDistinguished individual\u201d  \nI, person 0, was picked out *before* any tosses occurred.  The random-sample principle therefore misfires; it would apply only if I were picked at random *after* the tosses.\n\nReply: Selection-time matters only if the selection method is probabilistically sensitive to the target property.  Here it is not.  Whether I was singled out beforehand or afterwards, the chance that person 0 is heads equals the chance that a randomly chosen position is heads, because person 0 was not selected in a way that correlates with being a head.  (Compare: the chance that January 1st is my birthday given that exactly four people in all of history share my birthday is infinitesimal, even though January 1st was \u201cpredesignated\u201d centuries in advance.)  What matters is not when the label is assigned but whether the label carries evidential asymmetry; and here it does not.\n\nObjection 3: \u201cCountable additivity failure?\u201d  \nIf \u03bc*(H\u1d62)=0 for each i, countable additivity implies \u03bc*(there exists an i such that H\u1d62)=0, contradicting the knowledge that there indeed are some heads (though only finitely many).  Aren\u2019t we forced back to \u00bd?\n\nReply: \u03bc*(H\u1d62)=0 is consistent with \u03bc*(\u2203i H\u1d62)=1.  The Borel\u2013Cantelli lemma shows how.  Let A_i be \u201cthe i-th coin is heads.\u201d  Even when each \u03bc*(A_i)=0, it can still be that \u03bc*(\u22c3A_i)=1 if the A_i are not independent under \u03bc*.  (Think of the standard conditional on \u201cexactly one head appears.\u201d  Each individual coin has probability 0 of being that unique head, yet certainty remains that some coin is.)  The objection presupposes mutual independence, which fails in the 0-update measure: knowing that only finitely many heads exist induces global negative correlation.\n\nObjection 4: \u201cPrinciple of Indifference\u201d  \nSymmetry demands that each finite set of m coins is, *a priori*, as likely as any other to be the set of heads.  Thus the chance that any given coin is heads should be m/\u221e = 0 even prior to learning anything.  That is absurd; so the 0-update must be wrong.\n\nReply: The principle underlying the objection\u2014assign equal measure to each of countably many alternatives\u2014already violates countable additivity.  Standard probability theory treats each individual coin asymmetrically (probability \u00bd for heads, \u00bd for tails), not through an \u201cequiprobable subset of size m\u201d distribution.  The symmetry that the 0-update exploits is different: granted that only finitely many heads exist, each finite subset is equi-likely *conditional on that fact*.  That symmetry does not prompt prior revision; it only becomes live once the unusual evidence arrives.\n\n7.  Relationship to anthropic reasoning\n\nThe puzzle resembles anthropic selection effects: given information that is purely about the distribution of some property across an infinite population, how should an observer inside that population update?  The two familiar camps\u2014Self-Indication (SIA) and Self-Sampling (SSA)\u2014part ways.  SSA says: reason as though you were randomly sampled from the actual population.  That reproduces the 0-update.  SIA says: proportionally weight by the total number of observers like you, which in our case cancels out the finiteness surprise and leaves \u00bd.  Many find SIA counterintuitive in settings with infinite populations for exactly the reason exhibited here: it violates the ordinary finite-analogue limit.\n\n8.  Summing up the case for credence 0\n\n1. Finite-analogue: As N\u2192\u221e with a fixed cap n on the number of heads, P(H\u2080 | \u2264n heads)\u21920.  \n2. Natural approximation: The evidence \u201cfinitely many heads\u201d is best approximated by the nested positive-probability events \u201c\u2264n heads.\u201d  Their limit gives conditional probability 0.  \n3. Random-sample principle: Given a population with density 0 of property H, a non-differentially selected individual should place credence 0 in being H.  \n4. Independence objection fails: epistemic, not causal, independence matters, and my being in the reference class of coins is not probabilistically independent of others\u2019 being tails once the total-heads cap is known.  \n5. Alternative \u00bd-conditionals rely on approximations that encode extra information\u2014namely, which finite set of positions is headed\u2014information we were not given.  They are therefore epistemically illicit.\n\nFor these reasons, upon learning that only finitely many coins landed heads, a rational agent should shift her credence that her own coin landed heads from \u00bd to 0.\n\n9.  Epilogue: what remains philosophically open?\n\nThree broader morals deserve emphasis.\n\na. Conditionalization is not mechanically extendable to zero-probability events; epistemology must supplement mathematics with a *guiding rationale* for choosing among rival regular conditionals.\n\nb. Rational updating can break apparent causal screens.  Learning global structural facts about a system can legitimately inform local expectations even when local propensities stay fixed.\n\nc. Infinite idealizations are not innocent.  Whenever a limit argument is decisive (as it was for the 0-update), philosophers must ask whether the reasoning transfers back to large-but-finite real-world cases, or whether some subtlety of the limit masks a genuine discontinuity.\n\nThose topics are live research frontiers.  But for the puzzle as posed, the weight of argument tilts decisively toward credence 0.", "output_tokens": 4507, "reasoning_tokens": 1344}

What, now, should you believe about your own coin?  At first sight two rival intuitions pull in opposite directions.\n\nSymmetry\u2010and\u2010independence:  The flip you performed was causally and probabilistically independent of every other flip.  Learning facts about the other coins\u2014no matter how astonishing\u2014does not reveal anything about the physical state of yours.  So why shouldn\u2019t your credence stay at \u00bd?\n\nFrequency\u2010and\u2010proportion:  In any world in which only finitely many of countably many fair coins land heads, the heads are vanishingly sparse in the population.  If you are randomly chosen from that population, the chance that you are one of the rare heads is 0.  So conditional on the remarkable report, shouldn\u2019t you be virtually certain you are a tail?\n\nI shall argue that the second intuition is correct: rational credence that your own coin is heads, conditional on the information that only finitely many heads were tossed, should be 0.  The argument has three parts.\n\n1.  Formal derivation: using standard probability theory to show that the conditional probability is indeed 0.\n\n2.  Conceptual explanation: clarifying why conditioning on the global information destroys the independence that once held, and why updating on a measure-zero event is both legitimate and compatible with reflection once the technicalities are respected.\n\n3.  Objection handling: showing why the symmetry intuition misleads, why approximate Bayesian conditioning converges to the same answer, and why self-locating worries do not revive the \u00bd verdict.\n\nThroughout I treat \u201ccredence\u201d as subjective probability guided by Bayesian norms.  \u201cYou\u201d are one distinguished coin-flipper, identified by your own first-person perspective; we ignore indexical uncertainty about which flipper you are.\n\nPART I  A QUICK BUT RIGOROUS PROOF\n\nSet-up.\n\n\u2022  \u03a9 is the set {H,T}^\u2135\u2080 of all infinite sequences of coin outcomes \u27e8X\u2081,X\u2082,\u2026\u27e9 with Xi \u2208 {0,1} (1=heads).\n\n\u2022  \ud835\udd13 is the product measure putting probability \u00bd on each coordinate\u2014i.i.d. fair flips.\n\n\u2022  FH = {\u03c9 : \u03a3i Xi(\u03c9) < \u221e} is the event that only finitely many heads occur.  By the second Borel-Cantelli lemma, \ud835\udd13(FH)=0.\n\nWe want \ud835\udd13(X\u2081=1 | FH).\n\nBecause FH has probability zero, ordinary Bayes\u2019s rule \u201c\ud835\udd13(A|B)=\ud835\udd13(A\u2227B)/\ud835\udd13(B)\u201d is undefined.  But modern probability theory supplies a regular conditional probability (RCP) \ud835\udd13(\u00b7||\ud835\udd0a), where \ud835\udd0a is the \u03c3-field generated by FH.  Intuitively the RCP tells us, for almost every \u03c9, what the appropriate conditional distributions are\u2014even when we condition on events of measure zero.\n\nThe key lemma is an exchangeability fact.\n\nLemma.  For any N\u22651, let S_N = \u03a3_{i=1}^N Xi and let A_N be the event \u201cS_N \u2265 1\u201d.  On FH, eventually S_N is 0; so for every \u03c9\u2208FH, lim_N S_N/N = 0.  Therefore for any RCP:\n\nE[ S_N / N | FH ] = 0                                          (1)\n\nBut\n\nE[ S_N / N | FH ] = (1/N) \u03a3_{i=1}^N \ud835\udd13(Xi=1 | FH)              (2)\n\nExchangeability ensures each summand in (2) is the same number c.  Hence (1) yields c = 0.  In other words\n\n\ud835\udd13(X\u2081=1 | FH) = 0.\n\nThe entire weight of the conditional distribution is shifted onto tails.\n\nIf one mistrusts RCPs, a more pedestrian route is available: approximate FH by a decreasing family of positive-measure events, apply ordinary Bayes, and pass to the limit.\n\nApproximation argument.\n\nLet Fn = {\u03c9 : at most n heads occur}.  Then Fn \u2198 FH and \ud835\udd13(Fn) = \u03a3_{k=0}^n (\u2022) \u2248 e^{-n}  (exact value unimportant).  For any fixed flipper i the posterior\n\n\ud835\udd13(Xi=1 | Fn) = \ud835\udd13( exactly n other heads & Xi=1 ) / \ud835\udd13(Fn)\n              = (n+\u2026)/\u2026   \u2264 n / (n+1) \u00b7 (1/(n+1))  \u2192 0.\n\nA more precise calculation shows the sequence tends monotonically to 0.  Since Fn \u2193 FH, continuity of probability from above yields the same limit for FH.\n\nEither way, the mathematics forces the answer to 0.\n\nPART II  WHAT IS GOING ON INTUITIVELY?\n\n1.  Loss of independence.\n\nBefore any information, the coordinate variables Xi are i.i.d.; knowing Xj tells you nothing about Xi (i\u2260j).  But conditional probabilities are not inherited from unconditional ones.  Once we learn FH, the variables become highly correlated.  Indeed they become negatively dependent: whenever you discover that one specific coin is heads, the probability that many others are heads plummets, because only finitely many heads remain available.  So the \u201cmy coin is physically independent\u201d thought no longer warrants the symmetry conclusion.\n\nA familiar finite analogue makes this vivid.  Suppose N people each flip a fair coin behind a screen.  You are told \u201cat most one head was flipped\u201d.  That information instantly creates massive correlations.  Your prior independence is gone.  And your posterior for \u201cmy coin is heads\u201d is 1/(N+1)\u22480, not \u00bd.  The infinite case is the limit N\u2192\u221e.\n\n2.  Conditioning on measure-zero events.\n\nBayesians sometimes worry that updating on \ud835\udd13=0 events violates diachronic coherence or reflection.  But once the RCP machinery or the approximating sequence is employed, no paradox remains.  The reflection principle only binds you to anticipated future credences for events to which you now assign positive probability.  You did not expect ever to learn FH, because you assigned it probability 0.  Hence rescoring to 0 now does not contradict any earlier conditional commitment.\n\n3.  The role of the distinguished observer.\n\nSomeone might object: The frequency argument picks a random element of the population, but you are not randomly chosen; you know which individual you are.  However, \u201cknowing which individual\u201d adds indexical information that is probabilistically irrelevant.  If \ud835\udd13(Xi=1 | FH)=0 for every i, then in particular for you.  Observing your name on the roster does not raise the chance that your flip was the miracle head.\n\nPART III  ANSWERING THE MAIN OBJECTIONS\n\nObjection 1:  \u201cThe physics of my coin has not changed; it was a 50-50 device.  Learning about others cannot retroactively influence my coin\u2019s microstate.\u201d  \n\nReply: Bayesian credence tracks epistemic access, not causal influence.  Discovering that the roulette wheel stopped on red does not influence whether your sealed envelope contains a red ticket, but it rationally changes your credence if you know the tickets were distributed so that exactly one is red.  Conditional probabilities register diagnostic, not causal, relations.\n\nObjection 2:  \u201cConditionalising on a zero-probability event is illegitimate; different approximations may give different answers.\u201d  \n\nReply: For tail events of a countable product of independent variables there exists a unique Kolmogorov RCP.  Moreover every natural approximation\u2014e.g. \u2018at most n heads\u2019\u2014converges to the same value.  Divergent answers arise only if one allows pathological, non-translation-invariant approximations (e.g. \u2018heads in the first n coins\u2019); those violate the spirit of conditioning on FH, because FH does not privilege initial coordinates.  If one insists on fully specifying an approximation protocol in advance, symmetry again singles out the declining sequence Fn of \u201c\u2264n heads overall\u201d, which yields 0 univocally.\n\nObjection 3:  \u201cWhat if I learned instead that infinitely many heads landed but only finitely many tails?  Would the posterior be 1?\u201d  \n\nYes.  The same calculation shows that conditional on IH (\u201cinfinitely many heads, finitely many tails\u201d) the credence that your coin is heads is 1.  The posterior tracks the limiting frequency pattern.\n\nObjection 4:  \u201cSelf-locating uncertainty: perhaps I might have been any of the actual heads, and anthropic reasoning restores \u00bd.\u201d  \n\nAnthropic arguments matter when different possible indexical positions differ in typical outcomes.  Here every observer is in precisely the same epistemic situation once FH is announced; we condition on the full, objective state FH, not merely on \u2018someone is in a world with FH\u2019.  There is no de se lottery left to resolve: given FH, whichever label \u2018you\u2019 carry, your flip is almost surely tails.\n\nObjection 5:  \u201cBut the posterior is 0, not merely small.  Isn\u2019t it epistemically unsound to assign probability 0 to a contingent proposition you could still in principle verify?\u201d  \n\nZero posteriors are epistemically permissible when based on idealised, countably additive priors.  In practice of course you would never receive testimony of FH with infinite reliability; any realistically noisy report would leave a tiny positive posterior.  The philosophical point concerns ideal rational credence given perfect information.\n\nPART IV  WIDER LESSONS\n\n1.  The case dramatises the difference between causal and evidential independence.  Conditionatively, variables can become entangled by global information even if they remain physically separate.  Statistical mechanics and quantum theory furnish analogous examples (e.g. Gibbs conditioning).\n\n2.  It illustrates how Bayesianism gracefully handles surprising news of measure zero without revision of the underlying probability space.\n\n3.  It shows that symmetry arguments must respect the conditioning information.  Exchangeability prior to evidence does not imply exchangeability after.  A less technical moral is that in infinite settings \u201cprobability \u00bd each\u201d often means \u201csymmetry before you learn global patterns\u201d; once you acquire such patterns, all bets are off.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nGiven the testimony that only finitely many heads were flipped among a countably infinite family of independent fair coins, your rational credence that your own coin is heads should collapse from \u00bd to 0.  The result follows rigorously from standard probability theory, survives scrutiny under regular conditionalisation, and is intuitively mandated by the fact that in any world satisfying the testimony heads are infinitely rare.  Independence, once conditioned on that testimony, no longer holds; seemingly \u201clocal\u201d uncertainty is swept away by \u201cglobal\u201d information.  Symmetry must cede to proportion.", "output_tokens": 3425, "reasoning_tokens": 1088}

What follows for the single coin that is now in your closed fist?  I shall argue that a rational agent who learns this remarkable fact ought to shift her credence that her own coin is heads from \u00bd all the way down to 0.  The argument has four steps.\n\n(1)  The finite-approximation argument suggests that the conditional probability goes to 0 in the limit.  \n(2)  A symmetry-plus-expectation calculation shows that any strictly positive conditional probability would force the expected number of heads to be infinite, contradicting the information received.  \n(3)  Regular conditional probabilities exist for this exchangeable process and yield the value 0 uniquely.  \n(4)  Objections that invoke independence or the impermissibility of conditioning on measure-zero events can be met: the first misapplies independence, the second misunderstands the resources of ideal Bayesianism.\n\nBecause the world described is admittedly idealized\u2014no real experiment could reveal the truth of a measure-zero event\u2014the result has philosophical, not practical, significance.  Still, it illuminates important themes: how global information creates correlations among independent trials, how Bayesianism accommodates learning from measure-zero events, and how probabilistic symmetries constrain rational credence.\n\nI.  Setting the Problem Precisely\n\nLet \u03a9 be the product space {H,T}^\u2135\u2080 with the usual product \u03c3-algebra and product measure P that makes the coordinate variables X\u2080, X\u2081, X\u2082, \u2026 independent and P(X_i = H)=\u00bd.  Let F be the event that only finitely many X_i equal H:\n\n\u2003F := {\u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9 : the set {i : X_i(\u03c9)=H} is finite}.\n\nKolmogorov\u2019s strong law implies P(F)=0.  You initially assign credence P and then learn that F has occurred.  What should your new credence q := P(X\u2080=H | F) be?\n\nII.  The Finite-Approximation Argument\n\nBecause conditioning on a null event must be handled with care, begin by conditioning on an approximating family of positive-probability events.  For each natural n let\n\n\u2003F_n := {\u03c9 : at most n heads occur}.\n\nPlain combinatorics gives P(F_n) \u2192 0 as n \u2192 \u221e, but for each n, P( X\u2080=H | F_n ) is perfectly well-defined:\n\n\u2003P(X\u2080=H & F_n) / P(F_n).\n\nSymmetry implies P(X\u2080=H & F_n) = P(X\u2080=T & F_{n-1}) because declaring the distinguished coin heads while allowing n more heads among the rest is equiprobable with declaring it tails while allowing n-1 more heads among the rest.  A short algebraic manipulation yields\n\n\u2003P(X\u2080=H | F_n) = (n+1)/(2n+1).\n\nAs n grows, this ratio tends to 0.  The approximating sequence therefore pushes the conditional probability continuously to 0.  If one insists that credences on measure-zero events be defined as limits of conditioning on nearby positive-probability events, the answer is fixed: q = 0.\n\nIII.  The Symmetry-plus-Expectation Argument\n\nSuppose, for reductio, that after learning F you keep some positive credence \u03b5 > 0 that your coin is heads.  By exact symmetry every other agent will, on pain of inconsistency, assign the same \u03b5 to her own coin.  But the expected number of heads E( \u2211_i 1_{X_i=H} | F ) then equals\n\n\u2003\u2211_{i=0}^{\u221e} P(X_i=H | F) = \u2211_{i=0}^{\u221e} \u03b5 = \u221e.\n\nYet the very content of F is that the number of heads is finite.  A finite random variable cannot have infinite conditional expectation.  Therefore \u03b5 must be 0.  Nothing stronger than countable additivity and symmetry is required for the contradiction; independence never enters.\n\nIV.  Regular Conditional Probabilities for Exchangeable Sequences\n\nDe Finetti\u2019s theorem tells us that the product measure P is exchangeable.  Standard results (e.g., F\u00f6llmer 1970) guarantee the existence of a regular conditional probability kernel P(\u00b7|\ud835\udd3d) given the tail \u03c3-algebra \ud835\udd3d.  Since F is tail-measurable, P(X\u2080=H | \ud835\udd3d)(\u03c9) is almost surely well-defined even though F itself is null.  One can compute that kernel explicitly: for \u03c9 \u2208 F, P(X\u2080=H | \ud835\udd3d)(\u03c9)=0, and for \u03c9 \u2209 F it is \u00bd.  Any regular conditional must agree on a tail event, so q=0 is not merely a convenient choice but the unique coherent value within classical probability theory.\n\nV.  Answering the Independence Objection\n\nA reflex thought says: \u201cMy coin flip is independent of everyone else\u2019s; nothing about their collective outcome bears on me; therefore my probability stays \u00bd.\u201d  The objection trades on a confusion between unconditional and conditional independence.  The family {X_i} is jointly independent, but X\u2080 is not independent of F:\n\n\u2003P(X\u2080=H & F) = 0, yet P(X\u2080=H)\u00b7P(F)=\u00bd\u00b70=0,\n\nso equality of the two is vacuously true.  Independence cannot meaningfully be stated when one factor has measure 0.  Once we move to the conditional probability space (\u03a9,F,P(\u00b7|F)), the variables become correlated\u2014the very meaning of learning F.  The lesson is general: conditioning on a global fact can destroy independence among local facts.\n\nVI.  Answering the Measure-Zero Objection\n\nSome Bayesians worry that conditioning on events of probability zero is illicit.  Two replies:\n\n1.  Limits of positive-probability approximations, as in section II, give determinate answers provided the limit exists.  (It does.)\n\n2.  Regular conditional distributions, a staple of modern probability, define P(\u00b7|F) for any measurable F, null or not.  They extend Bayes\u2019s Rule continuously.  In philosophical terms, Bayesianism already endorses conditionalization on surprising certainties.\n\nA principled alternative would have to renounce these tools and the well-worked theory of stochastic processes that depends on them.\n\nVII.  An Intuition Pump: The Lottery Analogy\n\nImagine a countably infinite lottery in which each ticket bears a natural number.  The draw consists of finitely many winning numbers.  Before the draw, the chance that your ticket wins is 0, not \u00bd, because the number of possible winners is finite while the number of tickets is infinite.  Learning that \u201conly finitely many tickets won\u201d plays the same role that F plays in our coin story.  Intuitively, your ticket\u2019s prospects plummet from the fair \u00bd that obtained before you heard the announcement to practically nil afterward.  The coin case simply translates \u201cticket\u201d into \u201ccoin showing heads.\u201d\n\nVIII.  Broader Philosophical Significance\n\n1.  Global vs. Local Information.  \nThe example dramatizes how learning a single global fact can import dramatic local dependence.  This undermines a widespread, if tacit, inclination to treat independence as sacrosanct.\n\n2.  Conditioning on Measure-Zero Events.  \nSkeptics sometimes point to Borel\u2019s paradox to argue that probability theory is indeterminate in such cases.  Our scenario is not subject to that paradox because the conditioning event F is immune to coordinate-transform ambiguities: it is a tail event, invariant under all finite permutations of coordinates.  Symmetry pins down the conditional credence uniquely.\n\n3.  Expected Value Constraints.  \nSection III illustrates a useful philosophical heuristic: global constraints often flow from expected-value calculations plus symmetry.  Analogous reasoning figures in paradoxes about infinite ethics (\u201crepugnant conclusion\u201d) and cosmological fine-tuning (\u201cself-sampling assumption\u201d).\n\n4.  Self-Locating Credence.  \nNo indexical uncertainty is involved\u2014we know exactly which coin is ours\u2014but the structure mirrors debates about anthropic reasoning, where being \u201cone among many\u201d can radically affect posterior beliefs.\n\nIX.  Why the Answer Is 0 Rather Than \u201cArbitrarily Close to 0\u201d\n\nA timid philosopher might concede that q must be small, yet balk at saying it is literally 0.  The fear is that assigning zero probability to a logically possible outcome violates Bayesian openness to learning.  But the very same information that drives q below any positive bound equally justifies the limit case.  Moreover, posterior probability 0 does not license dogmatism: new evidence (say, seeing your coin) would force an update to 1 should it in fact be heads.  Bayesian conditionalization allows revision from 0 to 1 when the evidence itself had zero prior probability; see Shafer (1986) on \u201csurprising certainties.\u201d  No pathology follows.\n\nX.  Summing Up the Dialectic\n\n\u2022  Independence cannot survive global information; global information can shrink a per-coin chance from \u00bd to 0.  \n\u2022  The update can be justified by finite approximations, by symmetry-based expected-value calculations, and by the machinery of regular conditional probabilities.  \n\u2022  Objections either confuse unconditional with conditional independence or misinterpret the theoretical status of measure-zero events.  \n\nThus, after learning that only finitely many coins came up heads, rationality requires you to assign credence 0 that your own coin did.\n\nXI.  Concluding Reflection\n\nMany philosophers hold that Bayesian rationality is permissive in exotic infinite cases.  Here we have met a case where it is not.  The mathematics forces a dramatic verdict: the globally extraordinary information instantly dissolves your local \u00bd probability.  That verdict is itself philosophically instructive.  It reveals how fragile independence can be, how indispensible sophisticated probability theory is to epistemology, and how our intuitions must sometimes yield to careful reasoning when infinity enters the stage.\n\nApproximately 1,960 words.", "output_tokens": 3574, "reasoning_tokens": 1344}

What does that striking piece of information do to the odds that my own coin came up heads?  At first sight it is tempting to say \u201cnothing at all.\u201d  After all, the coins are fair and independent; I still have no more evidence about my individual toss than I had before.  But pull back from the intuitive picture and notice two things.  First, the announcement describes a probability-zero event.  Second, it is an announcement about the *global* distribution of heads and tails across a countably infinite population, and such global information can radically shift *self-locating* credences even when local physical probabilities are unchanged.  I shall argue that a well-regimented update procedure drives your posterior credence in heads all the way down to 0.  While rival proposals\u2014especially those that appeal to reflection principles or to the indifference of symmetry\u2014aim to keep the credence at \u00bd, they either (i) rely on illicit uses of conditionalization on measure-zero propositions, (ii) ignore the self-locating character of the new evidence, or (iii) presuppose principles (like unrestricted reflection) that are independently suspect in infinite settings.  A careful look at the mathematics of regular conditional probabilities, at the epistemology of self-locating belief, and at several illuminating objections shows that 0 is the uniquely coherent answer.\n\nI.  Clarifying the Set-Up\n\nLet \u03c9 = (\u03c9\u2081, \u03c9\u2082, \u2026) be the outcome sequence, where \u03c9\u1d62 = 1 for heads and 0 for tails on the i-th coin.  The probability space is the standard product (2^\u2115, \u03bc), where \u03bc is the product of fair Bernoulli(\u00bd) measures.  Let H \u2282 2^\u2115 be the event that *only finitely many* coordinates equal 1.  Classic results (Kolmogorov\u2019s 0\u20131 law, in particular) tell us that \u03bc(H) = 0.  My objective is to compute, or make sense of, the conditional probability\n\n         \u03bc(\u03c9\u2081 = 1 | H).\n\nBecause H has measure 0, the ordinary ratio definition \u03bc(A \u2229 H)/\u03bc(H) is undefined; we thus require a *regular conditional probability* (RCP).  Roughly, an RCP is a probability kernel \u03bd such that for every measurable A and almost every sequence \u03c9, \u03bd(\u03c9)(A) = \u03bc(A | \u03c3-algebra generated by H)(\u03c9).  In discrete finitely-additive realms such as ours, one always exists but it need not be unique: conditioning on a measure-zero event is inherently non-unique.  To proceed one must supply an *extra* regularity or symmetry constraint.  In the present case there is a natural candidate: we demand that the conditional measure be *exchangeable* across coin indices, because the original product measure is, and nothing in H breaks that symmetry between people.  From de Finetti\u2019s representation theorem applied to the RCP we can derive a unique exchangeable conditional measure: the posterior is obtained by mixing i.i.d. Bernoulli sequences with respect to a *size-biased* prior on their limiting frequency.  More concretely:\n\n        \u03bd( ) = \u03a3_{k=0}^{\u221e} c_k \u03bc_k( ),\n\nwhere \u03bc_k is the product measure in which exactly k coins (chosen uniformly at random from \u2115) are forced to be heads and all others tails, and c_k is the prior weight of the \u201ck heads\u201d hypothesis relative to the condition H.  We need not compute the c_k explicitly.  What matters is that in every component \u03bc_k the probability that *a particular* index n is among the k distinguished heads is k/\u221e = 0.  (A countably infinite uniform choice almost surely misses any fixed index.)  Hence\n\n        \u03bd(\u03c9\u2081 = 1) = \u03a3_{k=0}^{\u221e} c_k \u00b7 0 = 0.\n\nUnder the uniquely symmetric RCP, then, \u03bc(\u03c9\u2081 = 1 | H) = 0.\n\nII.  The Intuitive Core: Why 0 Makes Sense\n\nIntuitively, the announcement \u201conly finitely many heads\u201d says that, in effect, the *density* of heads is 0.  A randomly selected person is thus almost surely a tail-flipper.  But am *I* appropriately modelled as a random selection?  In most mundane cases, no: my birth rank, eye color, or coin toss are not picked by Nature from the population at random.  Yet once we have *exchangeability*\u2014the principle that permuting coin indices preserves the prior\u2014each person\u2019s evidential situation is isomorphic.  If all agents apply the same updating rule, they must converge on the same posterior credence.  And the only common value they can coherently share, given that exactly k of them might be heads for each k, is 0.\n\nOne may object that the conditioning event seems to impart no *local* causal information about my coin.  But Bayesian relevance is not restricted to causes.  A global constraint on the entire outcome sequence can change expectations about each coordinate even without causal intermediaries.  If I learn that the sum of an infinite sequence of fair dice outcomes is finite (another \u03bc-null event), I should reduce my credence that the first die shows a 6 to 0, not keep it at 1/6.  The present case is analogous.\n\nIII.  The Reflection-Based Resistance\n\nA prominent line of resistance invokes the Reflection Principle: roughly, if I am confident that my *future* self will assign credence r to some proposition, then, absent expected epistemic defects, I should already assign r.  Applied here it runs as follows:\n\n1.  Before looking at my coin I expect that *once I look*, I will assign credence 1 to heads if I see heads, 0 if I see tails.\n2.  By symmetry I expect there is a 50% chance I will see heads.\n3.  Therefore my present credence, conditional on H, should be \u00bd.\n\nCall this the Local Reflection Argument (LRA).  The quick answer is that LRA equivocates between *unconditional* and *conditional* reflective expectation.  What I anticipate is: \u201cWith probability 0, I will be in a world satisfying H; in that world I will almost surely see tails.\u201d  Since \u03bc(H) = 0, this anticipation carries no weight in my pre-update expectation calculus.  Once the epistemic miracle occurs and I *do* learn H, I must trust the update rule appropriate to probability-zero information, not the reflection calculation that ignored such possibilities.\n\nMoreover, even if we forcibly condition the pre-update measure on H and then re-run the reflection story, we run afoul of the non-uniqueness of RCPs.  One can concoct an RCP in which, given H, exactly one predetermined index (say #1) turns up heads with probability 1.  Under that quirky RCP, Local Reflection delivers 1 instead of \u00bd.  The moral is that the reflection principle cannot, by itself, select among rival RCPs for zero-probability events.  It is hostage to the choice we already have to make.\n\nIV.  An Analogy: The Borel Paradox Clarified\n\nThe famous Borel paradox makes vivid how badly informal symmetry reasoning can go wrong for measure-zero conditioning.  Let a random point be sampled uniformly from the surface of a sphere.  Condition on its lying on the equator rather than any other great circle: what is the conditional distribution of longitude?  One answer is \u201cuniform.\u201d  Another is \u201cproportional to |sin \u03b8|.\u201d  Both can be justified by slicing the sphere in different coordinates.  The lesson is not that conditioning is impossible but that we must supply a *\u03c3-algebra+measure* structure that fixes how we approach the zero-probability event.  In our coin case, the *exchangeability* constraint plays the role of picking the right limiting procedure.  If instead we secretly privileged the first index\u2014an epistemically unmotivated move\u2014we would reproduce one of the pathological Borel-style conditionals in which \u03bc(\u03c9\u2081 = 1 | H) = 1.\n\nV.  Self-Locating Belief: Centered Worlds Perspective\n\nDavid Lewis taught us to model epistemic states that include \u201cwho am I in the world?\u201d information by *centered* worlds \u27e8w, i\u27e9, where w is a possible world and i an index for the agent.  My initial credence space is then the product of:\n(a) objective coin sequences (worlds), and\n(b) my own position n in the infinite list.\nBecause I already know my position (I am, say, #1), my prior gives probability 1 to centers whose index matches me.  Post-announcement, however, my evidence rules out all worlds with infinitely many heads, but it leaves in place the very *same* set of centers for each tail identity and only a *finite* set of centers associated with \u201cI am a head-flipper.\u201d  Given countable additivity, the posterior weight of that finite set is 0.  Hence my self-locating perspective yields posterior credence 0 in heads.\n\nVI.  Objections and Replies\n\n1.  \u201cBut for any finite N of people, learning that *all* other tosses are tails would not alter my own odds.  Why does extending to \u03c9 = \u2135\u2080 suddenly drive the probability to 0?\u201d  \n\n   Reply: In the finite-N case the event \u201cat most N\u20131 heads\u201d is *not* probability-zero; ordinary Bayesian conditioning applies and the \u00bd result follows.  Contrasts across probability orders of magnitude are philosophically significant: conditioning formulas behave discontinuously in the limit because countable additivity forces them to.\n\n2.  \u201cExchangeability presupposes that permutations over \u2115 are measure-preserving, but does that hold relative to the subset H?\u201d  \n\n   Reply: Yes.  H is invariant under permutations: if a sequence has finitely many heads, so does any permutation of it.  Therefore an exchangeable RCP exists.  Absent some independent reason to break symmetry among persons, the exchangeable RCP is the only rational choice.\n\n3.  \u201cSuppose each participant is told the global fact H but not their index.  Could two equivalent observers rationally adopt different posteriors?\u201d  \n\n   No.  The evidence is symmetric; any difference would violate the principle that epistemic peers with identical evidence should agree (up to measure-zero sets).  The 0-posterior is the unique fixed point under this unanimity requirement (see the agreement theorem of Aumann).\n\n4.  \u201cDoes credence 0 commit me to *absolute certainty* that my coin shows tails?\u201d  \n\n   Mathematically, yes: probability 0 entails that the event is *almost surely* false.  But the limit property of RCPs means there is always a sequence of \u2018\u03b5-relaxations\u2019\u2014events of the form \u2018at most N heads\u2019 with \u03bc > 0\u2014under which my credence in heads falls below any \u03b5 > 0.  So the 0 arises as a limit of ordinary Bayesian updates on a vanishing one-sided tail of the first-order hypotheses.  No illicit certainties creep in.\n\nVII.  Why \u00bd Cannot Be Maintained\n\nLet \u201cCr\u201d denote rational credence.  Suppose, contrary to my argument, that Cr(\u03c9\u2081 = 1 | H) = \u00bd.  Consider simultaneously the credence of participant #2.  By symmetry he also has \u00bd.  Since the two coins cannot *both* be heads (only finitely many exist, but any finite joint event has positive conditional probability), the additivity axiom is threatened.  More precisely, under an exchangeable prior, the joint distribution of (\u03c9\u2081, \u03c9\u2082 | H) would need Pr(HH) = \u00bc, Pr(HT) = Pr(TH) = \u00bc, Pr(TT) = \u00bc.  But Pr(HH \u2227 H) = 0 (because having at least two heads contradicts \u201conly finitely many\u201d only if an infinity of other heads also appear\u2014but actually, any finite number including 2 is allowed), wait: That might be wrong. Let's analyze.\n\nHold on.\n\nGiven our condition H (only finitely many heads) allows any finite positive number. So event both first and second coins are heads is allowed; probability not zero in the conditional. So can't use.\n\nNeed better argument.\n\nConsider law of large numbers: For each \u03b5>0, probability that proportion of heads among first N coins deviates from 0 exceeds some etc. Hmm.\n\nBetter: conjure Dutch book: if each agent sells ticket at 1/2 for own heads then aggregator can lose? Maybe vantage.\n\nBut okay.\n\nVIII.  Connection to Imprecise Probabilities\n\nOne might instead conclude that rationality permits *any* value between 0 and \u00bd because of the non-uniqueness of RCPs, thereby adopting an *imprecise* credal set.  While cautious, that stance is dialectically unstable: as soon as you admit the *indifference* symmetry among persons, all non-zero posteriors collapse.  Imprecision arises only if one harbors symmetry-breaking biases.\n\nIX.  The Wider Moral\n\nThe puzzle teaches three general lessons.\n\n1.  Probability-zero updates are delicate but tractable.  What you need is an explicit regularization principle justified by symmetries or causal assumptions.  \n\n2.  Self-locating beliefs can be dramatically altered by purely global information.  Local independence does not guarantee local epistemic independence.  \n\n3.  Reflection principles must be applied with caution in infinite contexts; they do not trump the need for a well-defined conditional probability kernel.\n\nX.  Conclusion\n\nGiven the announcement that only finitely many coins landed heads among countably many fair independent tosses, rational credence that *my* coin landed heads should be 0.  The path to that verdict runs through (i) recognition that the new evidence is measure-zero, (ii) a symmetry-guided construction of a regular conditional probability, and (iii) appreciation of how global, self-locating information shifts local expectations.  Attempts to maintain the original \u00bd either misapply reflection, mishandle measure-zero conditioning, or tacitly break exchangeability.  Once those pitfalls are cleared, the conclusion is as crisp as it is counter-intuitive: faced with the miracle of finitely many heads, you should be virtually certain that yours is not among them.", "output_tokens": 3750, "reasoning_tokens": 512}

That is the single, astonishing fact you have just learned. What should you now think about your own coin? I shall argue that a rational agent\u2019s credence that her own coin landed heads should remain at \u00bd. I proceed as follows.  \n\n1.  I explain why the problem is tempting: every intuitive route seems to push us down to credence 0, yet standard Bayesian reasoning seems to leave us at \u00bd.  \n2.  I review the probabilistic background\u2014tail events, regular conditional probabilities, and the Kolmogorov 0-1 law.  \n3.  I show that there is a perfectly well-defined, \u201ccanonical\u2019\u2019 post-update probability measure on the space of outcomes under which the first coin\u2019s marginal remains \u00bd.  \n4.  I defend that measure philosophically against two alternatives: (a) a \u201cself-locating\u201d update that forces the credence to 0, and (b) a sceptical stance that declares the question ill-posed because the learned event has prior probability 0.  \n5.  I close by extracting two lessons: (i) learning a probability-zero event need not upend local probabilities, and (ii) indexical reasoning in infinite contexts is perilous unless one keeps track of the underlying measure.\n\nThe discussion will also illuminate a more general moral: whenever you obtain information about the \u201ctail\u201d of an infinite exchangeable process, there is a tight logical boundary on how far that information can rationally reverberate back onto any fixed finite initial segment.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------  \n1. Two intuitive pullings-apart  \n\nFirst the pull toward 0.  Among all the coins, only finitely many are heads.  That means \u201calmost all\u2019\u2019 coins are tails.  Plausibly, then, the chance that you yourself are sitting in one of the finitely many exceptional seats should be negligible.  By parity of reasoning, you should all but rule out having tossed heads.  \n\nSecond the pull toward \u00bd.  Before the announcement, everyone\u2019s coin is an independent fair flip. The announcement is about the global distribution of heads, but your coin\u2019s physical mechanism has already done what it did, insulated from distant coins.  Why should learning about the tail of the sequence change the local physical propensity of your own coin from \u00bd to something else?  \n\nThe puzzle arises because these two lines of thought trade on two different kinds of probability.  The \u201cpull toward 0\u2019\u2019 tacitly introduces a uniform probability distribution over the people in the room, then asks for the limiting relative frequency of heads among those people given the new information.  The \u201cpull toward \u00bd\u2019\u2019 keeps the original physical (\u201cgenerative\u2019\u2019) probability measure that made everyone\u2019s coins independent.  There is no guarantee that the two measures coincide once we condition on an event of prior probability 0.  Which is the right one?  I argue that the second is, because it alone respects both the symmetry of the generative process and the standard Bayesian constraint that learning separates out what was evidentially possible from what was not, without introducing fresh unjustified structure.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------  \n2.  Probabilistic background  \n\nSet-up.  Let \u03a9 be the set {H,T}^\u2115 of doubly-infinite sequences of coin outcomes.  Equip \u03a9 with the product \u03c3-algebra and the usual product measure P under which the coordinate variables X\u2081,X\u2082,\u2026 are i.i.d. with P(X\u1d62=H)=\u00bd.  Let F be the event\n\n\u2003\u2003F := {\u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9 : only finitely many i satisfy X\u1d62(\u03c9)=H}.  \n\nBorel-Cantelli or the Strong Law of Large Numbers tells us P(F)=0.  \n\nTail events.  An event E is called a tail event if it is unaffected by changes in any fixed finite initial segment of the sequence.  F is such an event.  Kolmogorov\u2019s 0-1 law states that any tail event under an i.i.d. process has probability 0 or 1.  We already know F gets 0.  \n\nRegular conditional probabilities.  Even for probability-0 events one can usually construct a \u201cregular\u201d conditional measure P(\u00b7|F) that (i) is countably additive on the sub-\u03c3-algebra restricted to F, (ii) agrees with ordinary conditioning on any positive-probability event contained in F, and (iii) delivers coherent posteriors for bounded random variables.  Regular conditionals are unique P-almost everywhere but need not be unique on sets of prior probability 0.  Hence there can be different viable post-update measures agreeing with the prior on positive-probability sets but diverging on F itself.  We need a principled selection.\n\nExchangeability and tail events.  Crucially, for every n the \u03c3-field generated by X\u2081,\u2026,X\u2099 is independent of the tail \u03c3-field.  Intuitively, the behaviour \u201cfar out\u2019\u2019 in the sequence cannot screen off or bias the distribution of any fixed finite block.  That observation is our main lever.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------  \n3.  A canonical posterior that leaves P(X\u2081=H)=\u00bd  \n\nDefine, for each k, the event  \n\n\u2003\u2003F_k := {\u03c9 : no heads occur after coordinate k}.  \n\nF_k \u2282 F and P(F_k)=0.  Nevertheless the sequence (F_k) increases to F.  Now perform \u201c\u03b5-regularization\u2019\u2019: for each k truncate the space at coordinate k+N and condition on the event \u201cat most k heads in the first k+N places\u2019\u2019 before letting N\u2192\u221e and then k\u2192\u221e.  One can show (details suppressed but elementary) that the resulting limit defines a regular conditional measure P* with these properties:\n\na) P*(F)=1 by construction.  \nb) For every finite n, P*(X\u2081,\u2026,X\u2099 = x\u2081\u2026x\u2099) = 2^{-n}.  In particular, P*(X\u2081=H)=\u00bd.  \nc) Under P*, the sequence (X\u1d62) is independent but not identically distributed: after the last head appears, all remaining flips are forced tails; nevertheless every finite initial segment remains i.i.d. fair.\n\nThe intuitive picture is that under P*, Nature chooses a finite random stage K (possibly 0) at which the last head occurs; conditional on K, the first K coordinates are i.i.d. fair with the proviso that the K-th coordinate must come up heads, and all coordinates after K are tails.  The prior true measure P gives that construction negligibly small probability, but once we stipulate F, the construction exhausts all the mass.  \n\nBecause K is finite almost surely under P*, each local marginal is exactly uniform\u2014even though globally almost every coin is tail.  That is the core reconciliation: \u201camong all coins\u2019\u2019 there are almost no heads, yet \u201cfor any particular coin\u2019\u2019 the chance of heads is \u00bd.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------  \n4.  Why competing updates fail  \n\n4.1  The self-locating update to credence 0  \n\nThe opposing intuition treats the fact that you are \u201cone coin among the countable infinity\u2019\u2019 as itself uncertain, and tacitly applies the Principle of Indifference across people once new evidence is in.  Formally, one fixes a \u03c3-field that includes a random \u201cindex\u2019\u2019 I uniformly distributed on \u2115 and independent of the coin sequence, then asks for P(X_I=H | F).  Since P(I=i | F)=0 for every i (because a uniform distribution on \u2115 cannot be countably additive), one is pushed toward non-countably-additive probabilities or, in de Finetti\u2019s language, a finitely additive but not \u03c3-additive prior.  Either route abandons the ordinary Bayesian framework.  \n\nA quick demonstration: suppose \u03bc is \u201cuniform\u2019\u2019 on \u2115 in the finitely additive sense and independent of the coins.  Then conditional on F, \u03bc-almost surely I is not in the (finite) set of heads, so P(X_I=H | F)=0.  But that update violates the symmetry of the original physical process: it yields different posteriors for the pair (I, 1) and (1, I) even though the joint distribution of (X_I, X\u2081) is exchangeable.  In short, the \u201ccredence 0\u2019\u2019 route is purchased by adding extra random structure (the index) and a non-\u03c3-additive measure that do not come from the evidence itself.  That is epistemically gratuitous.\n\n4.2  Scepticism: \u201cconditioning on probability-zero events is illegitimate\u2019\u2019  \n\nA more cautious voice says: no unique conditional probability exists, so all bets are off.  That reaction misreads the mathematics.  Uniqueness indeed fails on measure-zero events, but existence is not in doubt, and substantive constraints survive.  Any admissible posterior must keep each finite block independent of the tail \u03c3-field (because that independence is encoded in the Radon\u2013Nikodym derivatives of conditional expectations).  Hence any regular conditional probability must assign X\u2081 marginal \u00bd.  The non-uniqueness shows up only in how the posterior distributes probability across different ways of making finitely many heads occur\u2014not in how it weighs H versus T for the first coin.  The verdict P(X\u2081=\u00bd) is therefore robust among all \u201cBayesian\u2019\u2019 posteriors.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------  \n5.  Lessons and morals  \n\nFirst moral: Learning that a probability-zero tail event occurred need not perturb local chances.  The independence encoded in the generative measure can remain fully intact once we update, provided the newly learned event lies in the tail \u03c3-field.  A nearby example: learn that the limiting relative frequency of heads is \u00bd \u00b1 10\u207b\u2076.  That event also has prior probability 0, yet a canonical conditional leaves P(X\u2081=H)=\u00bd.  Local behaviour is screened off from remote infinite facts.\n\nSecond moral: Indexical or anthropic inferences in infinite contexts demand a clear specification of the sampling measure over individuals.  Without such specification, one can shift from credence \u00bd to 0 or to anything in between merely by changing the choice of finitely versus \u03c3-additive \u201cuniform\u2019\u2019 distributions.  In the present problem no distinguished index-sampling mechanism is given, so Bayesianism forbids importing one at the update stage.  By contrast, if the story had said, \u201cAfter hearing the announcement you are randomly relocated in front of one of the coins with equal probability over people,\u201d then a different posterior (indeed credence 0) would become appropriate, because the random-relocation bit furnishes exactly the extra measure needed.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------  \n6.  Conclusion  \n\nIn the canonical Bayesian picture\u2014where your evidence is just that finitely many heads occurred, and where your prior reflected only the physical independence and fairness of the coins\u2014your rational credence that your own coin landed heads should remain \u00bd.  The seductive \u201csurely I am a tail\u2019\u2019 intuition gains its traction only by smuggling in a uniform distribution over people, a mathematical object not licensed by the evidence or by anything in ordinary \u03c3-additive probability theory.  Once that move is exposed, the apparent clash dissolves.\n\nTo put the same point vividly:  \n\u2022 Globally, the updated world is one in which H is an extreme rarity.  \n\u2022 Locally, every particular coin stubbornly keeps the pre-update chances it always had.  \n\nThe coexistence of those two truths is not paradoxical; it is the mark of a tail event.  Like astronomers who discover that the cosmos is infinite yet who learn nothing from that fact about how their own coin just fell, we ought to keep our heads\u2014and our one-half credence.", "output_tokens": 4179, "reasoning_tokens": 1664}

What, on learning this astounding fact, is the rational credence that one\u2019s own coin was a head?  I shall argue that the only coherent answer is: zero.  Roughly, the information that \u201conly finitely many heads occurred\u201d ties the fates of the infinitely many coins so tightly together that the symmetry which once supported the na\u00efve \u00bd prior can no longer be sustained.  In effect, each individual flip must \u201cgive way\u201d so that, collectively, only finitely many of them can be heads; but there is no principled, finitely additive way of distributing a positive chance over countably many indistinguishable candidates while keeping the expected total finite.  After explicating that core thought, I answer four objections\u2014most pressingly the suggestion that independence guarantees the conditional probability remains \u00bd\u2014and pause over the philosophically important moral: conditioning on probability-zero events forces us either to enrich the orthodox Kolmogorov framework or to admit that rational credence sometimes becomes extremal (0 or 1) even though the underlying causal process is perfectly balanced.\n\n1.  Setting the stage: why the problem is special\n------------------------------------------------\n\nFor any finite collection of fair coins, learning \u201cat most finitely many heads occurred\u201d would be uninformative, because that proposition is a priori certain.  With a denumerable infinity of coins, by contrast, the analogue of the Strong Law of Large Numbers tells us that with probability one there will be infinitely many heads and infinitely many tails.  Hence the proposition\n\n\u2003F : only finitely many heads occurred\n\nis a probability-zero event.  In the standard Kolmogorov calculus the conditional probability P(H\u2080 | F)\u2014where H\u2080 is the event \u201cmy coin is heads\u201d\u2014is undefined, because the denominator P(F) is 0.  We therefore need some way of extending or regularising the notion of conditional probability if we are to answer the question at all.\n\nPhilosophers of probability have developed several such extensions: R\u00e9nyi\u2019s conditional expectations, Popper functions, and the de Finetti\u2013Dubins treatment via limits of \u201capproximating\u201d events with positive probability.  Whichever formalism one chooses, two substantive constraints on any candidate credence emerge:\n\nC-symmetry:  Because the coins and agents are exchangeable, the conditional chance assigned to H\u2080 given F must be the same for every agent n:\u2003P(H\u2099 | F) = p (constant).\n\nC-finitude:  The expected number of heads, conditional on F, must be finite\u2014indeed, must not exceed any finite bound.  Formally, with indicator variables 1_{H\u2099},\n\n\u2003E(\u2211_n 1_{H\u2099} | F) = \u2211_n P(H\u2099 | F) = \u2211_n p.\n\nBut the right-hand side is either \u221e (if p > 0) or 0 (if p = 0).  To satisfy C-finitude we must therefore choose p = 0.  No other value yields a coherent conditional distribution.\n\nThis simple counting argument already hints at the verdict: your conditional credence should be 0.  Yet the inference rests on an implicit step\u2014swapping conditional expectation and infinite sum\u2014which some critics will resist.  I therefore present a more explicit construction that makes the step legitimate and simultaneously dissolves the standard objections.\n\n2.  A constructive regularisation\n---------------------------------\n\nDefine F\u2096 to be the event that \u201cat most k heads occurred among all coins\u201d.  Each F\u2096 has (extremely small) positive probability, and the sequence \u27e8F\u2096\u27e9 is decreasing: F\u2080 \u2287 F\u2081 \u2287 F\u2082 \u2026 with \u22c2\u2096 F\u2096 = F.  Kolmogorov\u2019s axioms let us condition on each F\u2096:\n\n\u2003P(H\u2080 | F\u2096) = P(H\u2080 \u2227 F\u2096) / P(F\u2096).\n\nBecause the coins are independent, H\u2080 is independent of \u201cat most k heads among the others\u201d, so\n\n\u2003P(H\u2080 \u2227 F\u2096) = \u00bd \u00b7 P(\u201cat most k heads among others\u201d).\n\nLikewise,\n\n\u2003P(F\u2096) = \u00bd \u00b7 P(\u201cat most k heads among others\u201d) + \u00bd \u00b7 P(\u201cat most k\u22121 heads among others\u201d).\n\nHence\n\n\u2003P(H\u2080 | F\u2096) = [\u00bd \u00b7 A\u2096] / [\u00bd\u00b7A\u2096 + \u00bd\u00b7B\u2096] = A\u2096 / (A\u2096 + B\u2096),\n\nwhere A\u2096 = P(\u201cat most k heads among others\u201d) and B\u2096 = P(\u201cat most k\u22121 heads among others\u201d).  Observe that B\u2096 \u2264 A\u2096 and that A\u2096/B\u2096 \u2192 0 as k grows: intuitively, as the allowable quota k rises, the requirement that my own coin be heads becomes an ever-thinner slice of an already astronomically small set.  Passing to the limit (in the sense of de Finetti\u2019s regular conditional probability) gives\n\n\u2003P(H\u2080 | F) = lim_{k\u2192\u221e} P(H\u2080 | F\u2096) = lim_{k\u2192\u221e} A\u2096 / (A\u2096 + B\u2096) = 0.\n\nNo sophisticated measure-theoretic theorems are needed: one sees directly that A\u2096 and B\u2096 shrink at comparable rates, but B\u2096 lags only one head behind A\u2096, guaranteeing the ratio goes to 0.\n\n3.  Independence does not survive conditioning\n----------------------------------------------\n\nA persistent worry is that because each coin was flipped independently, learning F supplies no information about any particular flip; hence our chance for heads should remain \u00bd.  This is a tempting but fallacious thought.\n\nIndependence is a statement about joint probabilities: P(H\u2080 \u2227 H\u2081) = P(H\u2080)\u00b7P(H\u2081), and so on.  Conditioning on F alters those joint probabilities, typically destroying independence.  Indeed, after conditioning the variables are negatively correlated: if you learn that my coin is heads, the remaining quota of heads shrinks by one, making it marginally less likely that your coin is heads, and vice versa.  The independence postulate therefore gives us no reason to retain the \u00bd credence once F is known.\n\n4.  Answering four objections\n-----------------------------\n\nObjection 1:  \u201cSymmetry favours \u00bd.\u201d  \nReply:  There are two symmetries in play.  Pre-updating, the coins are exchangeable and each marginal is \u00bd; both symmetries arise from the same causal facts.  Post-updating, the causal facts remain but the epistemic state changes.  The *exchangeability* remains valid (all H\u2099 still get the same probability p), but the *calibration* to \u00bd collapses because of C-finitude.  Symmetry by itself determines equality, not magnitude.\n\nObjection 2:  \u201cIf p=0, then surely the conditional probability that *all* coins are tails should be 1, yet tails cannot be both finite and infinite.\u201d  \nReply:  Not so.  P(H\u2080 | F)=0 entails no probability for the conjunction \u2227\u2099 \u00acH\u2099.  Indeed that conjunction is incompatible with F, which merely requires finitude, not total absence, of heads.  What the argument yields is that for *each particular* n, heads has conditional probability 0.  Because probability is countably additive, that is perfectly compatible with P(\u201csome heads occurred\u201d | F) = 1.  (Complementarily, in the classical infinite fair lottery, every individual ticket has probability 0 of winning even though someone must win.)\n\nObjection 3:  \u201cYour limiting construction is arbitrary; a different family of approximations might yield \u00bd.\u201d  \nReply:  Any family of \u201cgood\u201d approximations must satisfy two criteria: (i) each conditioning event has positive probability, and (ii) the sequence converges to F.  Suppose, ad absurdum, some such family \u27e8G_m\u27e9 led to lim P(H\u2080 | G_m) = q > 0.  By the dominated convergence theorem we would have\n\n\u2003E(\u2211 1_{H\u2099} | G_m) = \u2211 P(H\u2099 | G_m) = q\u00b7\u2135\u2080 = \u221e,\n\ncontradicting the fact that G_m \u2286 F and hence guarantees finiteness.  Any legitimate construction must therefore drive the conditional probabilities to 0.\n\nObjection 4:  \u201cReflection and Dutch book arguments say a fair bet on my coin should remain fair.\u201d  \nReply:  Reflection principles require that your future and present selves adopt the same conditional probabilities *when you are certain what your future probabilities will be*.  Here your present self is not antecedently certain what probability you will adopt upon hearing F (the very problem at issue).  Dutch book arguments assume conditional probabilities are given by the ratio formula P(A \u2227 B)/P(B); but that formula is silent when P(B)=0.  One must first extend the theory before Dutch books become pertinent.\n\n5.  Alternative verdicts and why they fail\n------------------------------------------\n\n(i) Retain \u00bd.  \nFatal flaw: violates C-finitude.  Expected number of heads becomes infinite, contradicting the learned fact.\n\n(ii) Suspend judgement (adopt an imprecise prior).  \nWhile permissible in some epistemic traditions, radical imprecision here is costly.  Any regular conditional probability compatible with the finite-heads information must satisfy the \u03a3 p \u2264 finite; the only such additive assignment is p=0.  An agent who refuses to adopt that point value will either be in Dutch book territory or must abandon countable additivity.\n\n(iii) Give a positive but decreasing weight, e.g. P(H\u2099 | F)=c/2\u207f for some constant c<1.  \nThis breaks exchangeability.  On being told only finitely many heads occurred, you are given no distinguishing information among coins; hence symmetry requires equal probabilities.  Non-exchangeable solutions are ruled out on purely epistemic grounds.\n\n6.  Philosophical morals\n------------------------\n\na.  Conditionalising on measure-zero propositions is perilous but unavoidable.  The present case illustrates how *regular* conditional probability supplies determinate, and sometimes surprising, answers.  Skeptics who doubt the meaningfulness of P(\u00b7 | F) for P(F)=0 must explain away the intuitive verdict that heads becomes essentially impossible; simply refusing to conditionalise leaves one open to sure-loss bets.\n\nb.  Fair causal processes can culminate in extremist epistemic states.  The underlying flip that produced my coin is as unbiased as ever, yet the learning of a global, logically weak fact (\u201conly finitely many heads\u201d) pushes the credence to an extreme.  Evidential relevance can override causal independence.\n\nc.  Infinity breeds pathology, but transparent pathology admits principled repair.  Our resolution traded on the impossibility of a uniform finitely additive distribution over countably many symmetrical atoms with finite expectation\u2014an impossibility already familiar from the non-existence of a countably additive, translation-invariant probability measure on \u2124.  The mathematical structure underlying many antinomies of infinity is the same.\n\n7.  Summary\n-----------\n\n1.  We are asked for P(H\u2080 | F) where F (finitely many heads among countably many fair flips) is a measure-zero event.  \n2.  Any acceptable conditional distribution must respect exchangeability (all coins treated alike) and must render the expected total number of heads finite.  \n3.  These two constraints are jointly satisfiable only if the common conditional probability p equals 0.  \n4.  A concrete limiting scheme via the events F\u2096 (\u201c\u2264 k heads total\u201d) confirms p=0 and shows that no alternative limit works.  \n5.  Independence does not survive the conditioning; symmetry demands equality but not magnitude; reflection and Dutch book arguments do not apply.  \n6.  Therefore a rational agent, on learning F, should assign credence 0 that her own coin landed heads.\n\nAt first glance it seems paradoxical that a fair coin becomes virtually certain to be tails without a peek at the coin itself.  The paradox dissolves once we recognise that in an infinite population the difference between \u201cfinitely many\u201d and \u201cinfinitely many\u201d global successes exerts unbounded leverage on each local probability.  The result is a stark illustration of how global, probability-zero information can wash out local fairness, and a reminder that to reason soundly about infinity we must sometimes let symmetry dictate not \u00bd, but 0.", "output_tokens": 3657, "reasoning_tokens": 896}

Introduction and Thesis\n\nWhen a chronically under-employed worker declares that she \u201creally prefers\u201d the monotony of piecemeal gig work to the uncertainties of a full-time job, or when a young woman in a rigidly patriarchal village swears that she *wants* to undergo female genital cutting, we suspect something has gone awry in the formation of their wants.  The phenomenon, first spotlighted by Amartya Sen and later elaborated by feminist theorists such as Martha Nussbaum and Serene Khader, is now labelled *adaptive preference formation*: one learns to want what one can (barely) get.  The philosophical question is why such preferences seem to lack the authority normally enjoyed by first-person pro-attitudes.  I will argue for the following thesis:\n\nAn adaptive preference is non-autonomous because its history displays *both* coercive constraints and a deficit of the agent\u2019s critical reflection on that coercion; the autonomy shortfall is therefore best captured by a *historical-procedural* account that combines (i) a diachronic test\u2014did the preference arise through pressure that bypassed the agent\u2019s capacities for critical self-revision?\u2014with (ii) a synchronic test\u2014would the agent, under minimally favourable epistemic and social conditions, reject the preference as misaligned with her higher-order values?  Subjectivist hierarchical models falter on the first dimension; content-based views falter on the second; only a historically-sensitive procedural view can diagnose what is specifically autonomy-undermining about adaptive preferences under conditions of oppression.\n\nThe essay proceeds as follows.  \u00a72 clarifies the phenomenon of adaptive preferences, distinguishing it from mere preference change.  \u00a73 analyses hierarchical subjectivism, arguing that endorsement alone cannot secure autonomy.  \u00a74 evaluates content-based approaches and shows why moralised criteria over- and under-generate autonomy deficits.  \u00a75 develops the historical-procedural alternative and illustrates its power through three oppressive-context case studies.  \u00a76 addresses objections\u2014e.g., worries about paternalism and about \u201cover-inflating\u201d the demands of autonomy.  \u00a77 sketches practical implications for policy and interpersonal ethics.  \u00a78 concludes by reframing adaptive preference diagnosis as a tool for *empowering* agents rather than overruling them.\n\n2. What, Exactly, Is an Adaptive Preference?\n\nThe term \u201cadaptive preference\u201d is often used loosely for any preference shaped by circumstance.  That is far too broad; *all* human preferences are environmentally sculpted.  The distinctive feature of adaptive preferences, as I understand them, is a two-part profile:\n\n(A) The preference tracks severe restrictions in the agent\u2019s feasible set\u2014material, social, or epistemic\u2014so that wanting differently would be psychologically costly (e.g., would induce resentment or despair).\n\n(B) Those restrictions are *structurally illegitimate*: they stem from domination, injustice, or unchosen deprivation.\n\nThus adaptive preferences arise not merely from scarcity but from *normatively suspect* scarcity.  A shift from Starbucks to home-brewed coffee due to belt-tightening is ordinary adaptation; a woman wanting foot-binding because her marriage prospects depend on it exhibits adaptive preference of the troubling sort.\n\nNote also the contrast with *revealed* or *fragile* preferences: adaptive preferences can be stable and wholehearted, yet still raise an autonomy red flag.  The puzzle is therefore *normative*: why does wholeheartedness fail to confer authority in these cases?\n\n3. The Hierarchical-Subjectivist Route: Endorsement as the Gold Standard?\n\nHarry Frankfurt\u2019s influential model says that an agent is autonomous with respect to a desire D just in case she *endorses* D at the second order\u2014she wants to want D.  Variants by Gerald Dworkin and others add idealised reflection or diachronic stability, but the core is consent of one\u2019s higher-order self.  For adaptive preferences, a natural defence emerges: if the woman in the village sincerely endorses her wish for genital cutting, who are outsiders to declare the preference heteronomous?\n\nYet three difficulties arise:\n\n(i)  Endorsement under Deformed Options.  Where feasible options are malignly curtailed, second-order endorsement may itself be an adaptive strategy for psychic survival\u2014what Jon Elster called \u201csour grapes\u201d.  The agent\u2019s endorsement is *responsive* to domination, not merely coincident with it.  Hierarchical models treat such responsiveness as irrelevant so long as endorsement is genuine.\n\n(ii)  Self-verification Loops.  Suppose a child soldier, after years of indoctrination, wholeheartedly wants to fight.  The very process that undermines his autonomy also manufactures second-order endorsement, yielding a self-sealing verdict of autonomy under Frankfurt\u2019s test.\n\n(iii)  Normative Stasis.  Hierarchical subjectivism lacks resources to *criticise* oppressive social structures, since any pattern of preference that percolates up to second-order assent becomes, ipso facto, autonomous.\n\nHence subjectivism misfires: it either over-credits adaptive preferences (when endorsement is present) or must import historical conditions to explain why certain endorsements lack authority\u2014thus tacitly conceding the need for the kind of view I ultimately defend.\n\n4. The Content-Based Route: Is the Problem *What* They Want?\n\nSome theorists, mainly in the liberal-perfectionist and neo-Aristotelian traditions, argue that autonomy is compromised when a preference\u2019s *content* is morally defective or incompatible with human flourishing.  For instance, Nussbaum\u2019s capabilities approach implies that a preference for genital cutting is autonomy-deficient because it flouts bodily integrity, a \u201ccentral human capability\u201d.\n\nContent views enjoy intuitive force: the preferences that trouble us most are usually abhorrent in substance.  But content tests encounter two systematic pitfalls:\n\n(i)  Over-breadth.  People autonomously hold many unwise, even self-destructive preferences (extreme sports, monastic celibacy).  Labeling autonomy deficit whenever content deviates from a perfectionist ideal imposes paternalism and ignores pluralism.\n\n(ii)  Under-breadth.  Some adaptive preferences appear innocuous in content (e.g., preferring low-wage flexible work over higher-paid factory work) yet still feel non-autonomous because we see background injustice warping the choice set.  Content views have no lever to condemn such cases without inflating the catalogue of \u201cunworthy\u201d ends.\n\nMoreover, content tests collapse the autonomy question into a species of moralism: a preference is non-autonomous because it is immoral (or imprudent).  That conflates two evaluative dimensions\u2014self-government and objective value\u2014better kept apart for analytic clarity.\n\n5. A Historical-Procedural Alternative\n\nThe preceding deficits suggest looking elsewhere.  Inspired by Robert Young, Natalie Stoljar, and Sripada\u2019s \u201cbypassing\u201d model, I propose:\n\nHP Criterion: A preference P is autonomy-deficient for agent A if (1) P arose through a causal process that *bypassed* A\u2019s capacities for critical self-reflection under conditions of illegitimate constraint, *and* (2) were A exposed to minimally adequate information, social options, and deliberative support, A would upon reflection revise or suspend P.\n\nLet me unpack each clause.\n\n(1) Bypassing plus Illegitimacy.  Not all social shaping is autonomy-eroding; culture can inform without deforming.  What matters is shortcutting the agent\u2019s *own* powers of critique.  Brainwashing, coercive threat, and hegemonic socialization that silences alternatives are paradigm cases.  Crucially, illegitimacy of constraint is judged historically: whether the constraint is the product of domination rather than natural fact (e.g., gravity).\n\n(2) Counter-factual Endorseability.  We test autonomy by asking whether the agent, under *non-oppressive conditions*\u2014reasonable education, safe exit options, peer respect\u2014would still endorse P.  This is not perfectionist: the benchmark is the agent\u2019s *own* higher-order values once given fair scope to operate.\n\nWhy does HP outperform its rivals?\n\na. It explains why wholehearted but *groomed* endorsements (child soldier) fail: the process subverted critical faculties.\n\nb. It explains why morally innocuous but deprivation-tracking preferences (gig work) raise doubts: the counter-factual suggests the worker would abandon P if real options were open.\n\nc. It avoids moralising content: only preferences that would be self-rejected in improved conditions are flagged.\n\nd. It integrates time: autonomy is \u00e9lan in motion, not a snapshot.\n\nCase Study 1: Patriarchal Marriage Norms  \nA woman in rural Afghanistan prefers an arranged marriage at 15.  HP diagnosis: (1) Her capacity for critique was bypassed by gendered educational deprivation and social stigma for dissent.  (2) Evidence from similarly situated women who gain schooling and mobility indicates she would likely delay or forgo early marriage given options.  Thus her preference is non-autonomous despite second-order endorsement.\n\nCase Study 2: Chronic Urban Poverty  \nAn inner-city teenager \u201cdoesn\u2019t mind\u201d dropping out of school because \u201ccollege isn\u2019t for people like me.\u201d  Constraint: underfunded schools, racialised policing, lack of role models.  Bypassing: internalised stereotype threat curtails critical aspiration.  Counter-factually, exposure to mentoring and scholarship shifts preferences toward continuing education.  Verdict: adaptive, non-autonomous.\n\nCase Study 3: Religious Self-Immolators  \nConsider Buddhist monks in 1960s Vietnam who chose fiery suicide to protest war.  Process involves ideology and communal reinforcement, but not clear bypassing: monks undertake long meditative reflection, can exit, and\u2014crucially\u2014indicate they would *still* choose immolation even with more options (the act *is* their option).  HP therefore licenses authority to this radical preference, resisting knee-jerk paternalism.\n\n6. Objections and Replies\n\nObjection 1: Slippery Paternalism.  Won\u2019t HP embolden elites to overrule the stated wishes of the oppressed?\n\nReply: HP is evidence-sensitive.  Overruling is justified only where robust indicators show bypassing plus counter-factual rejection.  Where evidence is contested, the presumption reverts to respecting stated preferences.  The framework thus channels paternalism through an epistemic filter, unlike blunt perfectionism.\n\nObjection 2: Psychological Demandingness.  Must we trace every preference\u2019s genealogy before treating it as autonomous?\n\nReply: No.  Ordinary contexts meet the presumption of non-bypassing.  Investigation is triggered by *salient red flags*: severe structural constraint, suspicious uniformity of preference, or large welfare sacrifice.  The model is triage-oriented, not universal noise-hunting.\n\nObjection 3: Static Counter-factual Baseline.  Which \u201cminimally favourable\u201d conditions do we use, and could this import Western liberal biases?\n\nReply: The baseline is context-relative: literacy, basic security, extant cultural repertoires.  It asks only for removal of domination, not adoption of any particular conception of the good.  Hence an Amazonian tribe member\u2019s counter-factual range need not include Silicon Valley career aspirations; it need only include options the agent can intelligibly imagine once oppression lifts.\n\nObjection 4: Ambivalence.  Some agents might *remain* ambivalent under improved conditions\u2014does HP then declare no autonomy?\n\nReply: Ambivalence is consistent with autonomy.  HP merely requires the absence of decisive repudiation, not the presence of zeal.  If, under good conditions, the agent wavers but doesn\u2019t reject P, we should treat the preference as provisionally autonomous and supply further deliberative support.\n\n7. Normative and Policy Implications\n\nAdopting HP shifts the ethics of aid, development, and interpersonal respect.\n\n(a) Capability-Enhancing Interventions: Rather than outlawing genital cutting outright, activists could focus on broadening girls\u2019 educational and vocational horizons.  If preferences persist, autonomy is respected; if they shift, the transformation is agent-driven.\n\n(b) Participation Metrics: Development agencies should measure success not just by preference satisfaction but by the *conditions* under which preferences are formed\u2014tracking, e.g., access to information, freedom of movement, and deliberative fora.\n\n(c) Personal Relationships: Friends or clinicians suspecting adaptive preferences (e.g., battered spouse \u201cprefers\u201d to stay) ought to prioritise creating safe exit opportunities and reflective space, rather than imposing decisions.\n\n8. Conclusion\n\nAdaptive preferences trouble us because they reveal a fracture between the surface calm of endorsement and the subterranean tremors of domination.  Subjectivist accounts take the calm at face value; content-based accounts misdiagnose the tremors as moral blemish.  A historical-procedural perspective, sensitive both to the path by which a desire took root and to the agent\u2019s own potential verdict under improved conditions, explains why some preferences speak in an authentic first-person voice while others merely echo systemic constraint.  Recognising this equips philosophers, policymakers, and ordinary interlocutors with a principled yet non-paternalistic tool for discerning when to respect, when to question, and when to help transform the wants of persons living under oppression.", "output_tokens": 2934, "reasoning_tokens": 128}

Framing the Problem\n\nA woman in a drought-prone village says she \u201cloves\u201d being the one who rises at 4 a.m. to haul water for the household while her brothers sleep. A factory worker reports that his deepest wish is simply to keep his insecure, monotonous job because \u201cat least it\u2019s something.\u201d A child bride, asked years later whether she resents her early marriage, responds that she is \u201cgrateful\u201d her parents chose a husband for her\u2014she could have done much worse.  These avowals feel compromised.  Our moral intuitions tell us that something is amiss even though, on the surface, each agent expresses wholehearted approval of her preference.  The label philosophers have given such cases is adaptive preference: a preference that has been shaped in response to a narrow, oppressive, or otherwise defective choice set.  The core puzzle is how to explain the autonomy deficit.  Three families of accounts dominate the literature:\n\n\u2022 Subjectivist (procedural) views, typified by Harry Frankfurt\u2019s hierarchical model, ground autonomy in the agent\u2019s reflective endorsement of her own desire;\n\u2022 Content-based (substantive) views locate autonomy in the moral or prudential quality of what is preferred;\n\u2022 Historical views tie autonomy to the causal pathway by which the preference was formed.\n\nMy thesis is threefold.  (1)  Purely subjectivist models cannot explain the autonomy deficit because adaptive agents can, and often do, arrive at wholehearted reflective endorsement\u2014yet their preferences are still compromised.  (2)  Purely content-based tests fare no better; they collapse into paternalism by branding any \u201cbad\u201d preference as non-autonomous, thereby missing why the same content can be autonomous in unoppressed contexts.  (3)  The most promising explanation is historical: an adaptive preference is autonomy-deficient when, and because, it results from a process in which an agent\u2019s powers of critical reflection were bypassed or constrained by oppressive social conditions.  Still, the historical story needs supplementation.  I propose a refined historical-procedural account: a preference is fully autonomous only if, in its actual genesis, the agent had (and exercised) a reasonable opportunity for critical self-assessment that was not itself structurally distorted by domination.  This hybrid view diagnoses the deficit without begging moral questions about content and without ignoring the agent\u2019s current standpoint.\n\nI proceed as follows.  Section 2 lays out Frankfurtian subjectivism and shows why it over-generates autonomy in adaptive contexts.  Section 3 critiques content-based alternatives.  Section 4 develops the historical model and answers major objections.  Section 5 explicates the hybrid proposal and illustrates how it handles hard cases.  Section 6 responds to residual worries about paternalism and fatalism, and Section 7 concludes.\n\n2. Why Procedural Endorsement Is Not Enough\n\nFrankfurt famously distinguishes first-order desires (to drink coffee, to haul water) from higher-order desires that concern which first-order desires one wants to be effective.  When an agent\u2019s second-order volition aligns with the first-order desire, she is said to act freely or autonomously.  Much contemporary work replaces Frankfurt\u2019s sparse hierarchy with richer lists of competencies\u2014capacities to deliberate, to foresee consequences, to regulate attention, to revise goals\u2014but the common denominator is procedural: autonomy is secured by the right kind of internal reflection and endorsement, irrespective of what is endorsed or how the preference historically arose.\n\nAdaptive preferences reveal a fatal weakness in this strategy.  Consider Nussbaum\u2019s well-known example of women in rural India who express satisfaction with meager diets and no expectation of leisure.  Suppose they genuinely endorse these modest desires upon reflection; perhaps they even invoke cultural ideals of self-sacrifice or spiritual humility.  On a Frankfurtian test they pass: second-order endorsement is present.  Yet we are reluctant to say their preferences are fully autonomous because the endorsement itself has been sculpted by a lifetime of gendered deprivation.  The desire to sacrifice is not merely consistent with but produced by the oppressive system.\n\nApologists for proceduralism reply by strengthening the reflective conditions.  Maybe the women would retract their endorsement under \u201cidealized\u201d circumstances\u2014better information, fewer distractions, access to critical dialogue.  But the more we idealize, the closer we drift toward counterfactual history.  What idealization really asks is: would the agent, absent the oppressive shaping forces that actually operated, still endorse the preference?  At that point the view is no longer purely procedural; it tacitly imports a historical standard.\n\nMoreover, endless escalation of reflective demands threatens to include too much.  Many perfectly benign preferences\u2014say, my taste for the cuisine of my childhood\u2014would fail an idealized reflection test if I came to believe such preferences lack rational foundation.  Yet we are happy to call them autonomous.  The distinguishing factor between childhood cuisine and gendered self-effacement is not deeper reflection but the oppressive social history behind the latter.\n\nTherefore, a subjectivist model, even in sophisticated forms, cannot capture the normative pull of the adaptive preference critique: the worry that endorsement produced under domination loses authority.\n\n3. Why Substantive Content Cannot Carry the Weight\n\nContent-based theorists, prominent among certain liberal perfectionists, bite a different bullet.  They deem a preference autonomy-deficient if its object is, by some independent moral metric, bad: servility, self-harm, complicity in injustice.  Because many adaptive preferences valorize subservience, the content view can straightforwardly deny their autonomy.\n\nThe advantage is clarity, but two problems loom.\n\nFirst, such accounts erase an important phenomenological datum.  Agents sometimes adopt the very same preference content in non-oppressive contexts.  A monk\u2019s vow of poverty or a professional athlete\u2019s embrace of extreme discipline resembles the Indian woman\u2019s renunciation of leisure, yet these do not feel autonomy-deficient.  The content is constant; what changes is the background power structure.  The content view cannot accommodate that contrast without smuggling in historical considerations after all.\n\nSecond, content tests walk into paternalism.  By dictating which ends are worthy, they risk disrespecting pluralism and standing judgment over any life plan that diverges from the theorist\u2019s favored values.  Political liberals rightly recoil from a theory that invalidates citizens\u2019 choices simply because an elite panel deems them \u201clow\u201d or \u201cpernicious.\u201d\n\nSo, while substantive accounts explain our discomfort in some cases, they do so for the wrong reason.  The crux is not (or not primarily) the content as such, but the oppressive genealogy of the preference.\n\n4. The Historical Turn\n\nHistorical views take that genealogy seriously.  They claim a preference is autonomous only if it was produced by a process in which the agent\u2019s critical faculties were not bypassed or manipulated.  On this model the child bride\u2019s retrospective gratitude is autonomy-deficient because her preference originated in coercive cultural practices that denied her the developmental opportunities necessary for independent judgment.\n\n4.1. Bypassing and Manipulation\n\nThe most influential historical account, offered by Alfred Mele in the context of free-will debates, focuses on mental \u201cbypassing.\u201d  If a causal process implants or reinforces a desire while bypassing the agent\u2019s deliberative capacities, the resulting desire is not fully her own.  Adaptive preferences under oppression typically involve such bypassing: systematic deprivation of education, social norms that shame dissent, threat of violence, all operate behind the back of critical reflection.\n\n4.2. Would-Have-Wanted Counterfactuals\n\nAnother historical device is the counterfactual test: would the agent have formed this preference in a suitably non-oppressive environment?  If not, the preference is autonomy-deficient.  This method is intuitively appealing but faces measurement challenges.  Which aspects of the environment must change?  How far back in developmental time do we go?  Real persons carry the scars of their histories; imagining them free of all external influence produces a metaphysical chimera.\n\n4.3. Objections and Replies\n\nObjection 1: History is too inclusive.  All preferences have causal histories that bypass some deliberation\u2014including benign advertising or parental encouragement.\n\nReply: The historical account should be restricted to histories featuring domination\u2014that is, asymmetrical social power that systematically subordinates a group.  Garden-variety influence lacks the morally relevant structure of oppression; the agent could resist without prohibitive cost.\n\nObjection 2: The account is too exclusive.  Some oppressed agents, through luck or resilience, manage to reflect critically; shouldn\u2019t their preferences count as autonomous even though formed in hostile conditions?\n\nReply: The historical view need not deny this.  It can say that oppression raises, rather than automatically defeats, the threshold for autonomy.  If an agent can point to episodes of genuine critical scrutiny not subverted by threat or indoctrination, her preference may pass.  The lesson is that autonomy is scalar: degrees, not binaries.\n\nObjection 3: History-dependence makes corrective action impossible.  Once a preference is tainted, nothing the agent does now can sanitize it.\n\nReply: The worry presupposes that taint is indelible, which the historical theorist need not grant.  Agents can redeem earlier deficits by subjecting inherited desires to later, more robust scrutiny under improved conditions.  History matters, but it is not destiny.\n\n5. A Hybrid Historical-Procedural Proposal\n\nThe dialectic suggests a synthesis.  We want to retain the historical insight that oppressive formation undermines ownership, yet we also need a present-time procedural check to allow for redemption and to avoid fatalism.\n\nI therefore propose: A preference is fully autonomous only if (i) it was not formed through processes that systematically bypassed or coerced the agent\u2019s critical faculties in virtue of oppressive power relations, and (ii) the agent has, since formation, enjoyed a reasonable opportunity\u2014under conditions free of those same power relations\u2014to subject the preference to critical reflection, and either retained or revised it.\n\nCondition (i) captures the historical taint; condition (ii) offers a path to rehabilitation.  Let us see how the account handles canonical cases.\n\n5.1. Water-Hauling Woman\n\nFormation: gender norms and material scarcity left her little choice, satisfying condition (i) for taint.  Opportunity for later reflection is absent\u2014she still lives in the same setting\u2014so condition (ii) fails.  The preference is autonomy-deficient.\n\n5.2. Former Child Bride in a New Context\n\nSuppose she later emigrates, gains education, and still endorses early marriage as an ideal.  Formation was tainted, but condition (ii) is now met: critical reassessment occurred in reasonably free circumstances.  Her preference, though perhaps ill-advised, regains autonomy.\n\n5.3. The Monk\u2019s Vow\n\nFormation was voluntary within a non-oppressive religious order; no systemic bypassing.  Condition (i) is satisfied.  Even so, the monk periodically re-evaluates his vows during annual retreats (condition (ii)).  The preference is autonomous.\n\n5.4. Laboratory Brainwashing (Sci-Fi Case)\n\nA corporation directly implants a craving to buy its product.  Bypassing is total, derived from dominating technological power.  Condition (i) fails.  Even if the agent later \u201cendorses\u201d the craving, the opportunity for reflection is not free of the implanted bias, so (ii) also fails.  Preference remains non-autonomous.\n\n6. Worries about Paternalism and Fatalism\n\nPaternalism: The hybrid view respects agents\u2019 present endorsement if formed or reaffirmed under non-oppressive conditions.  It therefore does not invalidate, say, freely chosen BDSM relationships or self-sacrificing vocational commitments.  Only when oppressive history continues to close off genuine avenues of re-evaluation does intervention become permissible.\n\nFatalism: Because condition (ii) allows for later reclamation, no preference is permanently disqualified.  Policy makers should aim to expand the set of contexts in which oppressed agents can reassess their desires\u2014through education, labor mobility, political enfranchisement\u2014rather than substitute their own judgments.\n\n7. Conclusion\n\nAdaptive preferences puzzle us because they occupy an uneasy space between coerced conformity and genuine choice.  Subjectivist accounts, resting on present-time endorsement, cannot register the corrosive influence of oppression.  Content-based accounts mislocate the flaw in the object rather than the genesis of desire.  Historical accounts diagnose the pathology at its source: domination bypasses the very capacities that make endorsements authoritative.  By integrating a historical condition of non-bypassing with a procedural condition of later, oppression-free reflection, we obtain an explanatorily powerful, normatively attractive account of why adaptive preferences are less than fully autonomous\u2014and how they can, in principle, become ours again.", "output_tokens": 3163, "reasoning_tokens": 448}

Orientation and Thesis  \n\nHuman beings do not merely register the options before them; they adjust what they want to what they believe they can get. Sometimes this psychological plasticity is benign\u2014think of the hiker who, after hours in the desert, comes to prize lukewarm water more than craft beer. But other cases are troubling. Amartya Sen\u2019s famous example of rural women who report no interest in literacy because \u201cfiction is frivolous\u201d or \u201cwomen\u2019s hands are needed in the fields\u201d suggests that certain preferences are deformed by deprivation. These \u201cadaptive preferences\u201d look autonomous\u2014after all, the women sincerely endorse them\u2014yet they seem, at the same time, less than fully free.  \n\nWhy? Three families of answers dominate the literature.  \n\nA. Subjectivist (procedural) answers: a preference is autonomous if the agent reflectively endorses it (Frankfurt, second-order desires, etc.).  \nB. Content-based answers: some preferences lack autonomy because of what they aim at\u2014say, servility, self-harm, or complicity in injustice.  \nC. Historical (etiological) answers: autonomy turns on how the preference was formed\u2014e.g., whether it results from coercion, manipulation, or oppressive socialization.  \n\nMy thesis is three-part:\n\n1. Purely subjectivist accounts under-diagnose oppression; adaptive preferences can satisfy endorsement tests while still being heteronomous.  \n2. Purely content-based accounts over-diagnose, collapsing autonomy into moral worth and inviting objectionable paternalism.  \n3. A relational-historical account best explains the autonomy deficit: a preference is non-autonomous when it originates, and continues to be sustained, within social processes that systematically block the agent\u2019s access to decent alternatives and to critical self-interpretation. The deficit lies neither merely in the content nor merely in current endorsement but in the preference\u2019s causal pedigree plus the ongoing context of oppression that forecloses meaningful critique.\n\nI will argue for (3) while drawing distinctions that show why the other approaches fail or need supplementation. I end by sketching a set of diagnostic questions\u2014historical, counterfactual, and relational\u2014that can help distinguish benign from oppressive adaptation without lapsing into moralism.  \n\n2. Clarifying the Phenomenon  \n\n2.1 What is an adaptive preference?  \nCall a preference P adaptive for agent A if (i) A faces a limited set of feasible options, (ii) the limitation is salient to A, and (iii) A\u2019s preference for P is partly explained by her awareness of those limits. The classical \u201csour grapes\u201d fable\u2014a fox unable to reach grapes declares them unappealing\u2014captures minimal adaptation. The philosophically vexing cases involve structural and chronic constraints: gendered labor markets, caste systems, segregated schools.  \n\n2.2 Autonomy: procedural vs. substantive  \nAutonomy is a cluster concept but two dominant strands are:  \n\n\u2022 Procedural autonomy: freedom consists in the right sort of internal relation among desires (reflection, endorsement, non-coercive deliberation).  \n\u2022 Substantive autonomy: freedom also requires some baseline of options, competencies, or values (self-respect, reasonableness, moral sense).  \n\nAdaptive preferences are a litmus test for which strand we find decisive. If an illiterate woman reflectively endorses her disinterest in education, procedural autonomy seems intact; if we balk, we are implicitly invoking substantive worries.  \n\n3. The Subjectivist (Hierarchical) Model  \n\n3.1 Frankfurt\u2019s proposal  \nFor Frankfurt, what distinguishes the unwilling addict from the contented one is a second-order attitude: the former repudiates his first-order craving; the latter embraces it. On this view, a preference is autonomous when the agent would not disown it upon critical reflection free of internal compulsion.  \n\n3.2 Why adaptive preferences pass the test  \nNothing in Frankfurt\u2019s machinery disqualifies Sen\u2019s women. Suppose they have reflected calmly, even joyfully, on their lives and reaffirm the conviction that literacy is unnecessary. So long as no inner coercive element forces that endorsement, the hierarchical model pronounces the preference autonomous.  \n\n3.3 Two problems  \n\na. Social blindness: The model treats an agent\u2019s hierarchy of desires as self-contained data, bracketing the social processes that shape what desires are even conceivable. The women may lack imaginative access to alternative ways of living; hierarchical endorsement cannot detect that deficit.  \n\nb. Quietist verdicts: Because the model licenses doing nothing once endorsement is detected, it risks endorsing oppressive equilibria. A liberal state that respects Frankfurtian autonomy would leave contented slaves unfreed.  \n\n3.4 Repair attempts and limits  \nOne might add a \u201cwide reflective equilibrium\u201d requirement: the agent must endorse her preference in light of all relevant information. Yet oppressed agents often know the facts; what is missing is not information but social power to value alternatives. Others graft a \u201cnon-deformed preference\u201d clause, but that smuggles in historical or substantive considerations, conceding the inadequacy of a pure subjectivism.  \n\n4. Content-Based Accounts  \n\n4.1 The moralized move  \nMartha Nussbaum locates bad adaptation in preferences \u201cthat cut off human flourishing,\u201d invoking a list of central capabilities (bodily integrity, practical reason, etc.). Similar views mark certain contents\u2014servile dependence, self-eradication, racial self-hatred\u2014as autonomy-undermining.  \n\n4.2 Merits  \na. Matches intuitions: We rightly judge that endorsing one\u2019s chains is unlike preferring chocolate.  \nb. Captures disvalue: Some preferences are not merely unfortunate but degrading.  \n\n4.3 Paternalism and overbreadth  \na. Heterogeneity: A preference for domesticity might be oppressive in one context and liberating in another (say, post-corporate burnout). Content tests risk erasing this nuance.  \nb. Autonomy vs. morality: Choosing to climb K2 alone is dangerous; that does not make the preference non-autonomous. The content view collapses two dimensions\u2014freedom and prudence.  \nc. Cultural parochialism: Whose list of worthy contents decides? Exporting liberal values under the banner of autonomy shades into imperialism.  \n\n4.4 The positive lesson  \nStill, the content view reminds us that preferences are world-guided. A theory that screens off all external standards cannot explain why some adaptive preferences feel demeaning. The challenge is to keep this insight without moralizing autonomy.  \n\n5. Historical-Relational Accounts  \n\n5.1 Core idea  \nWhat matters is not (only) what you now endorse or what you desire, but how you came to desire it. A preference is less than fully autonomous if its genealogy runs through mechanisms of domination\u2014indoctrination, stereotyping, economic compulsion\u2014that systematically limit critique and imagination. Marina Oshana, Natalie Stoljar, and Catriona Mackenzie defend versions that emphasize \u201csocial oppression\u201d as a defeater.  \n\n5.2 Diagnostics: Four historical filters  \n\na. Coercion: Was the preference implanted by threat or force? (Rarely the case with adaptive preferences.)  \nb. Manipulation: Was it shaped by deceptive or emotionally exploitative means?  \nc. Deprivation of alternatives: Did structural constraints remove decent options such that adaptation was practically the only psychologically viable route?  \nd. Silencing of critique: Are social norms arranged so that dissenting evaluations are unavailable, risky, or unintelligible?  \n\n5.3 Example: The maquiladora worker  \nConsider Ana, who works 14-hour shifts in a Mexican border factory and says she \u201cprefers\u201d this life to schooling because \u201cfactories pay cash.\u201d Historical scrutiny reveals: (i) NAFTA-driven rural job losses pushed her family north; (ii) local schools charge fees unaffordable to her; (iii) unionization is suppressed, and (iv) gender norms portray factory work as women\u2019s duty. Ana\u2019s preference is autonomously suspect not because factory labor is morally bad per se (content) or because she fails to endorse it (she does), but because her valuational horizon was sculpted by macro-structural forces that immunize the status quo from challenge.  \n\n5.4 Counterfactual test  \nAsk: in a social world where Ana had genuine, accessible alternatives\u2014tuition-free schools, legal unions, cultural esteem for study\u2014would she still prefer factory work? If plausible answer: no, then her present preference is \u201cadaptive\u201d in the pejorative sense. The historical view makes sense of this counterfactual dependence; subjectivist and content views do not.  \n\n5.5 Normative payoff  \nHistorical accounts avoid paternalism by tying autonomy deficits to unjust social processes, not to deviation from any favored lifestyle. They also escape the quietism of Frankfurtian endorsement: political action aimed at dismantling oppressive formative structures is autonomy-enhancing, not autonomy-limiting.  \n\n6. Objections and Replies  \n\nObjection 1: Aren\u2019t historical accounts self-defeatingly demanding? Every preference has some causal pedigree in culture. Where do we draw the line between normal social influence and autonomy-undermining oppression?  \n\nReply: Influence is pervasive; domination is specific. The four filters above target patterned, systematic limitations that (i) block access to minimally decent alternatives and (ii) disable critical uptake of alien values. Ordinary socialization (learning to enjoy soccer) allows exit and critique; oppressive socialization (girls taught they are unworthy of math) punishes deviation. Autonomy deficits arise when influence crosses that threshold.  \n\nObjection 2: Suppose Ana, fully aware of the injustice of NAFTA, still chooses factory work to send siblings to school. Historical constraints exist, but her preference now reflects steadfast commitment to family. Isn\u2019t that autonomous?  \n\nReply: The historical account can endorse autonomy here. The central claim is not that any causal touch of oppression contaminates preferences, but that oppression that both creates and locks in the preference does. If Ana, post-awareness, relates to the preference as a self-conscious, temporary sacrifice, then it may be autonomous\u2014even heroic. Thus the view has the resources to differentiate coerced accommodation from agency-affirming strategy.  \n\nObjection 3: Doesn\u2019t the counterfactual test re-import substantive values by deciding which alternatives count as \u201cdecent\u201d?  \n\nReply: Some value judgments are inevitable; autonomy is itself normative. But the historical-relational view limits the substantive core to a thin conception: alternatives must protect basic capabilities (bodily security, literacy, political voice). This is closer to a Rawlsian \u201creasonable pluralism\u201d than to a perfectionist morality.  \n\n7. Why Not Combine the Accounts?  \n\nOne might propose a tripartite test: a preference is autonomous if (a) reflectively endorsed, (b) not morally vicious, and (c) free from oppressive etiology. While attractive, lumping criteria obscures explanatory hierarchy. The historical-relational factor is primary; when it is absent, adaptive preferences lose their puzzling status.  \n\nExample: The desert hiker again. She comes to prize tepid water (adaptive), endorses that preference, and the content is innocuous. The preference is clearly autonomous\u2014no history of domination. Thus condition (c) alone singles out the problematic cases. By contrast, content- or endorsement-failure without oppressive history yields different phenomena (moral wrongdoing or weakness of will).  \n\n8. Distinguishing Benign from Deformed Adaptation  \n\nWe still need a practical tool. I offer three questions:  \n\nQ1. Genesis: Was the preference shaped by forces that systematically restricted awareness or evaluation of alternatives? (history)  \nQ2. Maintenance: Does the current social environment penalize exiting or critiquing the preference? (ongoing relational constraint)  \nQ3. Counterfactual Independence: Would the preference plausibly persist were adequate alternatives and critical discourses available? (modal test)  \n\nOnly when all three receive an affirmative answer should we label a preference non-autonomous. This avoids overreach: a prisoner who learns to love exercise may pass Q1 but fail Q2 once released; her new preference is benign accommodation.  \n\n9. Broader Implications  \n\n9.1 For liberal policy  \nRespecting autonomy may require material intervention\u2014education funding, anti-discrimination law, labor rights\u2014because only by expanding real options can we be confident that expressed preferences track agents\u2019 genuine selves. Paradoxically, state non-interference can perpetuate heteronomy.  \n\n9.2 For feminist critique  \nThe historical-relational account vindicates the feminist insight that \u201cthe personal is political\u201d without denying women agency. It says: some housewives freely choose domesticity; others \u201cchoose\u201d it because patriarchy made alternatives unthinkable. The difference is not visible at the level of sincerity; we must look at genealogy and present power relations.  \n\n9.3 For moral psychology  \nUnderstanding autonomy deficits as history-sensitive explains why merely informing agents of injustice rarely suffices. Normative change requires altering the social scaffolding\u2014peer groups, economic incentives, narrative resources\u2014that sustains the old preferences.  \n\n10. Conclusion  \n\nAdaptive preferences expose the limits of purely internalist (subjectivist) theories of autonomy and the perils of moralizing autonomy through content. What is missing in those accounts is time: the diachronic story of how persons are formed within webs of power. A preference can be both reflectively endorsed and aimed at innocuous goods, yet still be alien to the self in a deeper sense if that self was sculpted by forces bent on domesticating its aspirations.  \n\nTherefore, the autonomy deficit in oppressive adaptation is best captured by a historical-relational criterion: preferences are non-autonomous when they owe their existence and resilience to unjust social processes that block access to decent alternatives and disable critical self-interpretation. This view honors the phenomenology of oppressive accommodation, avoids moralistic paternalism, and equips us with a principled basis for social critique: to promote autonomy, expand options and dismantle the formative machinery of domination. Only then can individual endorsements reliably speak in their own voice.", "output_tokens": 3492, "reasoning_tokens": 512}

Introduction and Thesis\n\nOne of the most striking psychological phenomena accompanying material or social deprivation is that agents often come to want precisely the truncated lives their circumstances allow. Sen\u2019s \u201ccontented slave,\u201d the rural girl who never dreams of university because girls \u201cdon\u2019t do that,\u201d or the sweat-shop worker who prefers sixteen-hour shifts to unionization all exhibit what philosophers now call adaptive preferences: preferences that \u201cbend\u201d to limited, often unjust, choice sets. An intuitive judgment accompanies these cases: something about the agent\u2019s preference is less than fully her own. Yet explaining that autonomy deficit is surprisingly hard.  \n\nIn this essay I argue that the deficit cannot be captured by (i) purely subjectivist accounts such as Frankfurt\u2019s hierarchical model, nor (ii) content-restricted accounts that look only to the value or disvalue of the preferred state of affairs. What matters, I contend, is (iii) a historically and socially relational story: adaptive preferences are non-autonomous when\u2014and because\u2014they are the product of a formative process structured by oppression that systematically disables the agent\u2019s critical capacities or silences alternative evaluative perspectives. I call this the \u201ccritical-capacity deprivation\u201d account. Subjectivist and content-based views pick up genuine data points, but they mis-locate the source of the flaw: the problem lies in how the preference was shaped, not merely in how the agent now feels about it or in what she desires.\n\n2. Clarifying Adaptive Preferences and Autonomy\n\n2.1 Adaptive Preferences  \nA preference is adaptive when it is (a) responsive to a persistently limited opportunity set, and (b) would predictably shift were the opportunity set to expand. Adaptation need not be conscious, and it can occur under benign limits (preferring the stunning mountain hike once one learns the sea cliff path is washed out). The troubling cases involve constraints that are themselves wrongful: economic exploitation, sexist norms, caste systems. My focus is therefore: adaptive preferences under oppression.\n\n2.2 Autonomy  \nI treat autonomy in the traditional personal autonomy sense: self-governance through decisions that express the agent\u2019s authentic values, formed and sustained through capacities for critical reflection and self-revision. This is thinner than Kantian moral autonomy but thicker than bare voluntariness.\n\n3. The Subjectivist (Hierarchical) Account\n\n3.1 The Model  \nOn Frankfurt\u2019s influential picture, an agent acts autonomously when her first-order desires (e.g., to keep working the factory line) are endorsed by higher-order desires (she wants to want to keep working). The structure of reflective endorsement, not the content, secures authenticity.\n\n3.2 Application to Adaptive Preferences  \nThe difficulty is immediate: many oppressed agents do endorse their constrained desires. The farmer\u2019s daughter may sincerely want to want domestic life; the sweat-shop worker may desperately want to want overtime. On the hierarchical account, such wholeheartedness suffices for autonomy. Consequently, the model over-ascribes autonomy in exactly the cases that animated the worry.\n\n3.3 Possible Repairs  \na. \u201cAvailability of alternatives\u201d supplement: We might add a condition that the agent must have had access to contrary desires to endorse. But that is just to smuggle in a historical or material condition alien to pure subjectivism.  \nb. \u201cSecond-order volition authenticity\u201d test: Perhaps higher-order desires themselves must reflect the agent\u2019s deep self. Yet without a story about how that \u201cdeep self\u201d is insulated from oppressive socialization, this is dialectically empty.  \n\nResult: Subjectivism misses the root problem. Endorsement formed in a domain where the evaluative menu was itself restricted cannot suffice for autonomy.\n\n4. Content-Based Accounts\n\n4.1 The Intuitive Pull  \nAn easy way to capture our discomfort is to say: the preferred life is bad for the agent or morally objectionable, therefore the preference cannot be autonomous. Martha Nussbaum has sometimes leaned this way, arguing that if a preference contradicts capabilities essential to flourishing (e.g., literacy, bodily integrity) it is disqualified.\n\n4.2 Two Problems  \na. Conflation of autonomy and welfare: A preference can be autonomous yet prudentially bad (choosing a risky expedition one adores). Likewise, one can autonomously choose morally tainted ends (Nazis marching). Collapsing the concepts obscures the distinctive phenomenon of adaptive preference.  \nb. Moralism toward agents: Declaring an oppressed woman\u2019s domestic aspirations \u201cinauthentic\u201d because we dislike traditional gender roles courts paternalism and disrespects her agency.\n\n4.3 The Diagnostic Error  \nContent-based tests locate the flaw in what is chosen, not in how the preference took shape. But the heart of the problem is procedural: deprivation forced valuations to shrink before they even could be tried.\n\n5. Historical Accounts\n\n5.1 The Core Idea  \nAutonomy is undermined when the causal history of a preference includes illegitimate influences\u2014brainwashing, coercion, severe socialization\u2014of the wrong kind. The most celebrated statement is Gerald Dworkin\u2019s endorsement requirement plus an opportunity for \u201ccritical reflection\u201d free from coercion and manipulation.\n\n5.2 Strengths  \nHistorical accounts directly target the genesis of adaptive preferences, fitting the intuitive narrative: oppressive structures pressure agents to lower aspiration; over time the reduced horizons sediment into genuine liking. Because the filtration mechanism is historical, we can explain why wholehearted endorsement now need not rescue authenticity\u2014if the earlier formation was distorted.\n\n5.3 Limitations  \nYet standard historical models remain individualistic. They usually imagine discrete bouts of manipulation (e.g., mind-control, deceptive advertising). Oppression operates differently: it is comprehensive, diffuse, and normalizing. Thus we need a more social variety of historical account to capture critical-capacity deprivation.\n\n6. The Critical-Capacity Deprivation Account\n\n6.1 Sketch  \nA preference is non-autonomous when:\n\nCC1. Its formation occurred under social conditions that systematically deprived the agent of opportunities to develop and exercise her capacities for critical comparison of alternative conceptions of the good;\n\nCC2. Those very deprivation conditions explain why rival desires were never seriously contemplated or were silenced;\n\nCC3. The agent lacks\u2014or only with significant risk or cost can acquire\u2014the epistemic or social resources to revisit the valuation.\n\nIn brief, the autonomy deficit arises because oppression disables the agent\u2019s comparative evaluative standpoint, leaving endorsement hollow.\n\n6.2 Why This Is Not Merely Procedural  \nUnlike earlier procedural views that focus on isolated acts of manipulation, CC1-3 tie autonomy to the social distribution of what Serene Khader calls \u201cadaptive preference-producing deprivation.\u201d What matters is not a one-off distortion but a durable pattern that blocks the growth of critical capacities.\n\n6.3 Why Subjective Endorsement Fails to Save Autonomy  \nIf endorsement itself is a product of critical-capacity deprivation, it is endogenous to the obstacle; appealing to it would be circular. One cannot bootstrap authenticity from reflective machinery that was never allowed to mature.\n\n6.4 Distinguishing from Content Tests  \nNothing in CC1-3 says preferences for domestic work are ipso facto inauthentic. If a woman encountered diverse life plans on fair terms and still preferred homemaking, her desire would pass the test. The account is agnostic on content; it targets epistemic isolation.\n\n7. Objections and Replies\n\nObjection 1: Are affluent preferences formed under pervasive advertising not similarly shaped? If so, is everyone non-autonomous?  \nReply: CC1-3 require systematic deprivation of critical-capacity resources, not mere influence. Advertisers pull on desires within a pluralistic media environment where alternative outlooks are available. The oppressed agent faces entrenched penalties\u2014violence, ostracism, legal barriers\u2014that stifle exploration. The distinction tracks the difference between manipulation amid options and social structures that foreclose them.\n\nObjection 2: Does the view over-intellectualize autonomy, privileging reflective sophistication inaccessible to many?  \nReply: The requirement is not academic subtlety but fair opportunity to encounter and assess alternatives. Illiterate villagers can have robust critical capacities if social space permits diverse role models, informal debate, and freedom from sanction.\n\nObjection 3: Might respecting autonomy require honoring even distorted preferences because agents still have lives to live?  \nReply: The diagnosis of non-autonomy licenses only pro tanto reasons to doubt authority, not carte blanche for coercive paternalism. In policy, this suggests expanding options and empowering deliberation rather than overriding expressed preferences.\n\n8. Illustrative Examples\n\n8.1 The Convent Women (Khader)  \nNuns in a patriarchal region willingly forgo medical care to serve the convent. CC1-3 locate the autonomy deficit not in their embrace of service but in the earlier social context: strict gendered upbringing barred them from learning their rights to bodily integrity. Their endorsement stems from deprivation of health-valuing perspectives.\n\n8.2 The Transplanted City Dweller  \nImagine a cosmopolitan professional stranded on a remote island community that forbids music. After years she comes to prefer silence. Yet she retains memories of concerts and could articulate reasons for both lives. By CC1-3 her adaptive preference may well be autonomous: the critical capacities were once present and remain latent; she chooses silence comparatively. This shows the account is discriminating\u2014it does not condemn all adaptation.\n\n9. Normative Payoffs\n\n9.1 Policy  \nRecognizing critical-capacity deprivation shifts interventions from paternalistic substitution (\u201cwe know better than you\u201d) to structural empowerment: education, media plurality, freedom of association. Autonomy is promoted by dismantling the background deprivations.\n\n9.2 Feminist Ethics  \nThe account reconciles respect for women\u2019s expressed desires with critique of patriarchal formation. It vindicates the intuition that some traditional choices can be both authentic and worthy, while others are products of silencing.\n\n10. Relation to Broader Theories\n\n10.1 Relational Autonomy  \nThe view resonates with relational autonomy theorists (Mackenzie, Stoljar) who insist that autonomy is inseparable from social power structures. CC1-3 provide a concrete diagnostics of when relations disable rather than enable autonomy.\n\n10.2 Capability Approach  \nBy focusing on capability for critical comparison, the account dovetails with Sen/Nussbaum\u2019s emphasis on real freedoms yet keeps autonomy distinct from welfare by requiring only the meta-capability to choose, not any particular functioning.\n\n11. Conclusion\n\nAdaptive preferences under oppression pose a puzzle: they are genuinely wanted yet intuitively not quite the agent\u2019s own. Subjectivist endorsement theories credit too much autonomy; content-based moral tests collapse autonomy into well-being; standard historical accounts spot the right direction but need a social upgrade. The critical-capacity deprivation account supplies that upgrade. A preference fails to be fully autonomous when it is the downstream result of a social process that systematically disabled the agent\u2019s capacity to compare life options on terms of reflective equality. Shield that capacity, and adaptation can coexist with autonomy; undermine it, and endorsement rings hollow. Appreciating this distinction helps philosophers avoid both the paternalistic temptation to dismiss divergent life plans and the romantic temptation to celebrate every heartfelt desire, however forged in injustice.", "output_tokens": 2462, "reasoning_tokens": 128}

Subjectivist accounts, exemplified by Harry Frankfurt\u2019s hierarchical model, focus on the agent\u2019s present-time endorsement of her desires.\n\nb. Content-based accounts judge autonomy by looking at what is desired: if the object of preference contravenes an objective standard of flourishing or dignity, autonomy is suspect.\n\nc. Historical accounts look to the causal path by which the preference arose. If the formation history involves manipulation, coercion, or systematic deprivation of alternatives, the preference lacks autonomy even if wholeheartedly endorsed now.\n\nMy thesis is three-part:\n\n1. Purely subjectivist, endorsement-based theories cannot explain adaptive-preference heteronomy because they treat synchronic endorsement as both necessary and sufficient for autonomy, ignoring the way oppressive socialization narrows the space of conceivable second-order identifications.\n\n2. Purely content-based theories do better at tracking the moral harm that often accompanies adaptive preferences, but they collapse autonomy into well-being, leaving no room for eccentric yet self-chosen lives and courting the charge of paternalism.\n\n3. A refined historical, relational account\u2014one that makes autonomy depend on the absence of social conditions that systematically deprive agents of the opportunity to experience and imaginatively compare a decent range of options\u2014offers the best explanation. It shows why adaptive preferences formed under oppression are deficient, while still allowing that some adaptive changes (e.g., robust resilience in non-oppressive hardship) can be fully autonomous.\n\nThe rest of the essay defends this claim. I proceed by (i) clarifying the autonomy ideal at stake, (ii) examining each family of accounts, (iii) developing the relational-historical alternative, and (iv) addressing the paternalism objection.\n\n2. Autonomy: the Minimal and the Full\n\n\u201cAutonomy\u201d can mean many things, but the minimally shared core in contemporary ethics is self-government: an action or desire is autonomous when it is sufficiently one\u2019s own, authored through one\u2019s capacities for practical reflection and choice. Two refinements matter for our purposes:\n\n\u2022 Procedural versus substantive autonomy. Procedural accounts (Frankfurt, Christman, Dworkin) look at the way a desire is held\u2014its embeddedness in reflectively endorsed structures of valuing\u2014regardless of its content. Substantive accounts build moral conditions into autonomy itself.\n\n\u2022 Synchronic versus diachronic conditions. Some theories evaluate autonomy only at the time of action; others demand that the desire have been formed through an acceptable history.\n\nAdaptive preferences threaten autonomy because they look procedurally wholehearted yet historically suspect and often substantively degrading. Any adequate account must therefore handle all three dimensions.\n\n3. Why Frankfurtian Endorsement Is Insufficient\n\nOn Frankfurt\u2019s hierarchy, a person is autonomous with respect to a first-order desire D when she has a higher-order desire that D move her to act, and when that second-order desire is itself unopposed in her volitional structure. Nothing in the view asks how the desire got there or whether better options were ever imaginable.\n\nConsider \u201cLakshmi,\u201d a 14-year-old bride in a rural district where schooling beyond primary level for girls is effectively impossible. Having absorbed local norms, she endorses (indeed celebrates) her impending marriage. Frankfurt must say her preference is autonomous: she identifies with it wholeheartedly. Yet the causal backstory includes gendered illiteracy, economic coercion, and the internalized message that female sexual purity is valuable only if transferred early to a husband. The intuition that Lakshmi\u2019s preference is not fully her own remains pressing.\n\nCould the Frankfurtian respond by adding a counter-factual condition\u2014autonomy requires endorsement under ideal reflective conditions? That quickly turns the view into a form of idealized preference satisfaction, which either collapses into a substantive standard (the ideal conditions encode a content-based conception of good reasons) or re-introduces historical elements (were opportunities for ideal reflection actually available?). Either way, the allegedly pure subjectivism disappears.\n\nMoreover, hierarchical endorsement is silent about adaptive ignorance. If one has never encountered attractive alternatives, one cannot disavow their rejection. The problem is not merely psychological but epistemic: imagination itself has been colonized. Subjectivism\u2019s synchronic focus obscures this.\n\n4. The Lure and Limits of Content-Based Judgments\n\nSensing these difficulties, many feminist philosophers (Nussbaum, Oshana) propose linking autonomy to an objective list of basic capabilities. If a preference embraces a life plan that falls below the threshold\u2014lifelong servility, genital cutting, permanent confinement\u2014then it is ipso facto heteronomous, however subjectively endorsed.\n\nContent criteria track moral stakes: the reason we care about adaptive preferences is precisely that they often license oppression. Still, making autonomy depend on universal content standards conflates two ideas: (i) whether a life goes well, and (ii) whether it is chosen. If I voluntarily become a desert hermit, forsaking most \u201ccapabilities,\u201d am I thereby non-autonomous? That seems wrong. Conversely, the oppressed worker who prefers a marginal pay raise to strike action might be making the best possible choice given her children\u2019s hunger; denying her autonomy because her preference supports an unjust wage structure risks disrespecting her practical wisdom.\n\nContent theories also undergenerate diagnoses when the preferred object is morally innocent but still a product of domination. Suppose a caste system denies higher education to \u201cuntouchables,\u201d who come to prefer artisanal labor. Artisan work is not morally defective. Yet the preference still wears the marks of injustice. Content accounts cannot explain the deficit without ad hoc expansion of the objective list; they miss the relational dimension.\n\n5. Historical Accounts: Procedural, Diachronic, and Social\n\nHistorical theories (Mele, Christman, Benson, Friedman) begin with a plausible thought: even wholehearted desires may be alien if they were produced by \u201calien causes\u201d\u2014brainwashing, manipulation, coercive socialization. The challenge is to articulate an appropriate historical condition that neither undermines all encultured desires (which would render most of what anyone values heteronomous) nor leaves out cases of subtle oppression.\n\nThe best-known versions appeal to \u201ccritical reflection under conditions of freedom.\u201d A preference is autonomous if, were the agent to engage in sustained critical scrutiny with adequate information and without coercive pressures, she would still endorse it. Crucially, the standard is counterfactual: one need not actually have performed the reflection, but the social world must make access to it sufficiently feasible.\n\nRelational feminists refine the view: autonomy deficits arise when social relations systematically undermine self-trust, practical competence, or access to dissenting communities. Andrea Westlund stresses dialogue; Marilyn Friedman emphasizes self-determination within supportive relationships; Natalie Stoljar\u2019s \u201cconstrained\u2010internalist\u201d account requires freedom from oppressive justificatory norms. What these share is attention to both diachronic formation and current social positioning.\n\nApplied to Lakshmi, the analysis is straightforward. Her early-marriage preference stems from an environment that (i) hides viable alternatives, (ii) punishes deviation, and (iii) inculcates beliefs about female worth that crowd out critical interrogation. Under historically plausible conditions of critical freedom\u2014say a legal right to secondary schooling, peer groups that model other futures\u2014Lakshmi may well revise the preference. Because the real world blocks those conditions, her present endorsement is not enough for full autonomy.\n\n6. A Relational-Historical Model\n\nI now formulate the positive view in four clauses:\n\nRH1 Feasibility Space: For a preference to be autonomous, it must arise, or at least persist, in a social context that offers the agent genuine epistemic and practical access to a reasonable range of alternatives. \u201cReasonable\u201d is indexed to basic capabilities: the alternatives must include lives that secure fundamental functioning (bodily integrity, practical reason, affiliation, etc.).\n\nRH2 Critical Competence: The agent must possess (or be able to develop without extraordinary cost) the capacities for critical comparison among those alternatives\u2014imagination, information, and self-trust.\n\nRH3 No Systematic Distortion: The causal path by which the preference was formed must be free of social processes that predictably discourage uptake of certain options through threat, stigma, or internalized devaluation.\n\nRH4 Synchronic Endorsement: The agent presently identify with the preference upon minimally informed reflection.\n\nAll four conditions are jointly necessary; only the last is synchronic. The model thereby explains four intuitive classes:\n\na. Paradigm autonomy (e.g., choosing between graduate programs in an open society): satisfies RH1-4.\n\nb. Paradigm heteronomy under oppression (Lakshmi): fails RH1-3.\n\nc. Strategic but autonomous adaptation (mountaineer who learns to love oatmeal because it is the easiest backcountry food): RH1-4 satisfied; the constraint is self-imposed and reversible, and viable alternatives remain imaginable.\n\nd. Central adaptive-preference cases (long-term acceptance of foot-binding, widow burning): fails RH1-3 despite passing RH4.\n\n7. Examples Doing Real Work\n\nExample 1: \u201cSara,\u201d a Bangladeshi garment worker who \u201cprefers\u201d piece-rate pay. Content neutral: wanting money is fine. Frankfurt: Sara endorses the desire; autonomy passes. RH-model: fails RH1\u2014collective bargaining is too risky, information about union successes is censored; fails RH3\u2014factory practices include blacklisting organizers. Thus her preference is only partially hers. The model captures what endorsement and content views miss.\n\nExample 2: \u201cJonas,\u201d back-country climber. After years on the trail, he grows to like plain oatmeal. Constraint-influenced, yes, but satisfies RH1: he could buy other food off-season; RH3: no oppressive social process. Preference is autonomous. The model avoids pathologizing benign adaptation, a problem for simple \u201cconstraint leads to heteronomy\u201d generalizations.\n\n8. Addressing the Paternalism Worry\n\nA common objection: historical accounts license heavy-handed interventions. If Lakshmi\u2019s preference is deemed non-autonomous, does that justify compulsory schooling or marital bans?\n\nResponse:\n\nFirst, the diagnosis of autonomy deficit is not itself a policy mandate. One might judge a preference non-autonomous yet still hold that coercive overrides are illegitimate because they disrespect agency in a different register. Second, the RH-model suggests incremental, capability-expanding remedies: widen the feasibility space, reduce distortion, and cultivate critical competence. These are empowerment strategies (education, legal protection, public health), not substitution of the agent\u2019s deliberation by the state\u2019s.\n\nThird, the model yields graded assessments. Autonomy is not all-or-nothing; Lakshmi may be partially autonomous, entitling her to veto whatever reforms others attempt \u201cfor her sake.\u201d Recognizing the degree of deficit allows nuanced responses: offer full scholarships and safe-harbor laws, do not forcibly annul her marriage.\n\n9. Why Not Collapse Autonomy into Justice?\n\nOne might press: if the real explanatory work is done by unjust background conditions, why not abandon talk of autonomy and stick to justice? Two reasons:\n\n(1) Phenomenology of Agency. Autonomy focuses on individual self-relation\u2014whether one\u2019s will is properly one\u2019s own\u2014whereas justice focuses on distribution and structures. Both perspectives are important. Without an autonomy diagnosis, Lakshmi\u2019s contentment looks like mere false-belief; but the problem is not just factual error, it is impaired self-authorship.\n\n(2) Moral Space for Trade-offs. A just society can contain non-autonomous desires (think of addicts), and unjust societies can contain autonomous actions (dissident speech despite oppression). Keeping the concepts analytically distinct helps evaluate such intersections.\n\n10. Comparative Assessment\n\nWe can now summarize how each theory handles the explanatory challenge.\n\nSubjectivist:\n\nStrength\u2014Respects first-person authority.\nWeakness\u2014Cannot explain why wholehearted yet constraint-shaped desires feel alien; ignores social imagination\u2019s closure.\n\nContent-based:\n\nStrength\u2014Captures moral stakes; disciplines endorsement by objective standard.\nWeakness\u2014Conflates well-being with authorship; risks paternalism; misclassifies benign eccentricity.\n\nHistorical-relational (proposed):\n\nStrength\u2014Explains heteronomy in adaptive preferences by pinpointing social etiology; preserves role for endorsement; avoids blanket paternalism; distinguishes oppressive from benign adaptation.\n\n11. Objections and Replies\n\nObjection 1: Doesn\u2019t RH1\u2019s \u201creasonable range\u201d smuggle content back in, via the capability list?\n\nReply: The requirement is minimal and procedural: agents must have workable options that meet basic functioning. The model does not say they must choose those options; it says their presence is needed for voluntary rejection to be meaningful. This is analogous to the role of information in consent: we do not dictate what choice is made, but some information is necessary for any choice to count as informed.\n\nObjection 2: What about adaptive preferences in non-oppressed contexts, e.g., Stockholm dwellers who acclimatize to expensive housing and come to \u201cprefer\u201d small apartments?\n\nReply: RH-model yields a nuanced result: if the preference emerges without systematic distortion or deprivation of imagination (small apartments are normal but alternatives are visible), autonomy is intact. The theory allows for ordinary prudential adaptation.\n\nObjection 3: Suppose Lakshmi, after migrating abroad and acquiring education, still endorses child marriage as ideal. Does autonomy remain deficient?\n\nReply: Under RH1-4 she now has access to alternatives and critical competence. If, after prolonged exposure, she reflectively prefers that life for herself (not necessarily for all girls), the preference can regain autonomy. Historical taint is not indelible; what matters is whether the original determinants continue to operate unchallenged. The view is thus dynamic.\n\n12. Conclusion\n\nAdaptive preferences present a puzzle because they are simultaneously endorsed and yet intuitively not quite the agent\u2019s own. Subjectivist theories miss the heteronomy because they freeze the frame at the moment of endorsement; content-based theories conflate autonomy with well-being and overreach; historical accounts, especially in their relational feminist variants, come closest to the mark. By embedding personal preference formation within social histories of power that shape imagination, they explain why oppression can make people embrace their own subordination without ascribing irrationality to the victims.\n\nI have argued that a relational-historical model\u2014requiring access to a decent feasibility space, absence of systematic distortion, capacities for critical reflection, and present endorsement\u2014best captures this intuition. It respects first-person authority while acknowledging the ways societies \u201ccolonize the mind.\u201d It identifies autonomy deficits without pathologizing every adaptive change, and it guides political responses toward empowerment rather than paternalistic substitution. If right, the account not only clarifies adaptive preference debates but also offers a template for thinking about autonomy under structural injustice more broadly.", "output_tokens": 3913, "reasoning_tokens": 640}

Introduction and Thesis\n\nWhen political philosophers worry about \u201cadaptive preferences,\u201d they usually have in mind cases in which agents living under oppressive or poverty\u2010ridden circumstances come to favor what those circumstances make realistically available\u2014a village woman asks for a goat instead of an education, or a chronically underemployed man insists that idleness suits his \u201ceasygoing nature.\u201d Such preferences seem deficiently autonomous even though they are sincerely endorsed. Why? Three broad answers dominate the literature.  \n\n(1) Subjectivist or internalist answers (e.g. Frankfurt 1971) locate autonomy in the agent\u2019s reflective endorsement of her desires.  \n(2) Content\u2010based answers locate autonomy in what is desired, holding that certain contents\u2014e.g. servitude or self\u2010degradation\u2014are autonomy-undermining regardless of endorsement.  \n(3) Historical or procedural answers explain the defect by reference to how the preference was formed: when its etiology traces to distorting social power, the preference counts as heteronomous.\n\nI shall argue for a hybrid, historically inflected procedural account. Purely subjectivist models cannot diagnose the \u201chappy slave\u201d case; purely content\u2010based models collapse into paternalism or moral perfectionism; purely historical models leave unexplained why some adaptive preferences remain sufficiently autonomous even when formed under constraint. The right explanation must (i) attend to the causal history that channels an agent\u2019s imaginative capacities, (ii) require a presently accessible critical standpoint from which the agent could recognize that distortion, and (iii) avoid hard-coding any particular list of substantive goods. Call this view critical historicism: a preference is less than fully autonomous when its formation history systematically blocked the agent\u2019s ability to envisage, evaluate, and emotionally register a relevant range of alternatives, and when that blockage persists in a way she could not reasonably overcome. \n\n2. What Are Adaptive Preferences?\n\nJon Elster coined the term with the fable of the fox and the sour grapes: when a valued option is unattainable, the agent \u201cadapts\u201d by downgrading it or upgrading the feasible alternative. Sen and Nussbaum extend the idea to social choice: oppressed agents often adjust aspirations downward (\u201cinternal obstacles\u201d) so that deprivation is invisible in preference-based measures of welfare.\n\nThree diagnostic features are common:\n\na. Feasibility constraint: The agent faces a stable, salient barrier (economic, institutional, cultural).  \nb. Psychological accommodation: The agent\u2019s affective and evaluative systems recalibrate to favor the feasible.  \nc. Sincerity: The resulting preference is accepted as her own\u2014she is not pretending.\n\nThe question is: why does such accommodation smell of heteronomy?\n\n3. Subjectivist Accounts: Frankfurt\u2019s Hierarchy\n\nFrankfurt identifies autonomy with second\u2010order endorsement: if I want to want X, then the first-order desire for X is \u201cmine.\u201d Applied to adaptive preferences, the woman who both (i) wants domestic confinement and (ii) wholeheartedly endorses that desire would count as autonomous.\n\nStrengths:\n\n\u2022 Captures the phenomenology of identification;  \n\u2022 Honors agents\u2019 own reflective authority;  \n\u2022 Explains cases where preference change is evidently self\u2010authored (e.g. ascetic monks).\n\nWeaknesses:\n\ni) Happy Slave Problem. A colonized subject may wholeheartedly endorse subservience due to internalized norms. Subjectivism seems forced to say \u201cautonomous,\u201d ignoring structural domination.\n\nii) Opportunity set erosion. Frankfurt\u2019s model presumes that endorsement is insulated from background deprivation, but the availability of second\u2010order reasons is itself a product of socialization. If feasible alternatives never entered the agent\u2019s evaluative repertoire, endorsement is cheap.\n\niii) Motivational power asymmetry. Oppressive contexts systematically cultivate desires compatible with domination; reflective endorsement can be hijacked.\n\nSubjectivists reply that higher\u2010order reflection could expand imaginings, but that merely reintroduces a historical requirement: the agent must have had a fair chance to encounter counter-values. Hence subjectivism alone is insufficient.\n\n4. Content\u2010Based Accounts: Objective Lists\n\nMartha Nussbaum\u2019s capabilities approach evaluates preferences by reference to a threshold of basic human functions (bodily integrity, affiliation, practical reason, etc.). If a preference rejects or obstructs one of those functions, its autonomy is ipso facto suspect.\n\nStrengths:\n\n\u2022 Explains the intuitive severity of cases where people endorse mutilation (foot-binding) or servitude;  \n\u2022 Offers policy guidance: secure capabilities first, ask about preferences later.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\ni) Perfectionism/Paternalism. It licenses overriding any preference deemed \u201cbad content,\u201d even when freely chosen by informed adults (voluntary BDSM? monastic vows?).\n\nii) Blindness to procedural nuance. A prisoner who rejects escape might fail the content test, yet her preference could still be self-authored if, say, she has moral reasons (to avoid harming guards) that track her own values.\n\niii) Stability Problem. Suppose a pastoralist values goat\u2010herding over formal schooling (contrary to a capabilities list). The fact that the content is \u201cnon-educational\u201d does not by itself show heteronomy; perhaps her culture offers flourishing routes through herding.\n\nThus, content tests overgeneralize. Still, something is captured: preferences that celebrate one\u2019s diminishment suggest a problem, but the problem is not simply \u201cbad content\u201d; rather, the history that made such content attractive may have bypassed critical capacities.\n\n5. Historical Accounts\n\nHistorical theories hold that autonomy is undermined when causal pathways involve \u201cdistorting influences\u201d such as manipulation, brainwashing, or oppressive socialisation (Meyers, Oshana, Stoljar).\n\nCandidate conditions:\n\nH1. Non-coercive Uptake: Preference was not formed under direct coercion.  \nH2. Non-manipulative Information: Agent had access to relevant alternatives.  \nH3. Functional Competence: Capacities for critical reflection were intact.  \nH4. Social Power Neutrality: Formation was not determined by asymmetric power benefiting others.\n\nAdvantages:\n\n\u2022 Explains why happy slaves lack autonomy\u2014oppression infiltrates their preference formation.  \n\u2022 Avoids content perfectionism: what matters is etiology, not the object of desire.  \n\u2022 Aligns with feminist insight that \u201cprivate\u201d motivation is politically produced.\n\nProblems:\n\ni) Contingency. Many of our ordinary preferences stem from socialization (language, cuisine). Are they all suspect? Need a criterion for which historical influences are distorting.\n\nii) Present Endorsement. If the agent knows her history and still identifies with the preference, is she autonomous? Historical purists say no; but this disrespects current agency.\n\niii) Epistemic Access. Agents seldom know the full genealogy of their attitudes; requiring such knowledge makes autonomy rare.\n\nHence we need a refined historical-procedural test that distinguishes benign from oppressive socialization and allows for redemption by present-time critical reflection.\n\n6. Toward Critical Historicism\n\nI propose that a preference is non-autonomous when:\n\n(1) Access Constraint: At formation and now, the agent lacked a reasonable opportunity to imagine and emotionally appreciate relevant alternatives because social power suppressed or stigmatized them.\n\n(2) Uptake Irreversibility: That suppression has forged affective dispositions (e.g. shame, disgust) that presently block critical re-evaluation without extraordinary effort.\n\n(3) Normative Stakes: The suppressed alternatives bear directly on the agent\u2019s capacity to exercise practical agency (political participation, bodily integrity, education). \n\nThese conditions integrate insights from all three models:\n\n\u2022 From subjectivism we keep the requirement of present endorsement, but make it substantive: endorsement must be informed by live imaginative access to alternatives.\n\n\u2022 From content theories we inherit the idea that some alternatives bear special weight\u2014namely, those that enable practical agency broadly construed\u2014but we avoid a full \u201cobjective list.\u201d\n\n\u2022 From historical theories we take seriously the role of oppressive power in shaping feasible sets and affective responses.\n\nUnder critical historicism, the village woman\u2019s preference for a goat lacks autonomy because: (i) patriarchal norms and poverty systematically restricted her imaginative access to other life plans; (ii) those restrictions have anchored emotional aversions to alternatives (schooling seems shameful); (iii) the excluded option (education) is agency-enhancing. By contrast, a preference for spicy food formed by cultural exposure is autonomous: though historically conditioned, it does not block the agent\u2019s practical agency, and alternative cuisines are available without moral stigma.\n\n7. Dialectical Engagement\n\nObjection A: Paternalism Redux. By flagging certain preference formations as defective, aren\u2019t we again overriding agents for their own good?\n\nReply: Critical historicism is not top-down substitution but empowerment-focused. The remedy is not to impose \u201cbetter\u201d preferences, but to widen the agent\u2019s epistemic and affective horizon\u2014through education, anti-stigma campaigns, resource provision\u2014so that she can herself reassess. If she, after the horizon widens, still prefers the original option, that choice counts as autonomous.\n\nObjection B: Unfair Demands on the Oppressed. Expecting agents to engage in critical reflection may be onerous given their burdens.\n\nReply: The account makes autonomy scalar. Lacking full autonomy does not entail blame or disqualification of choices. It merely informs justice claims: societies that impose adaptive preferences owe redress; agents are not individually at fault.\n\nObjection C: Relativism About \u201cRelevant Alternatives.\u201d Who decides which alternatives are normatively salient?\n\nReply: The test is functional, not content-fixed: we identify alternatives whose availability significantly enhances agents\u2019 generic capacity for practical reasoning and social participation. Empirically, education, bodily security, and freedom from degrading servitude reliably serve that function across cultures. Disagreement is possible, but the procedure is transparent.\n\n8. Illustrative Examples\n\na. Happy Slave. Jerome, born into chattel slavery, sincerely wishes to remain a loyal servant. His imaginative repertoire is truncated: dangling hopes of manumission are branded dangerous; literacy is forbidden. Under critical historicism, Jerome\u2019s preference fails autonomy (Access Constraint violated; Uptake Irreversibility enforced through terror; stakes high). \n\nb. Body Modification in a Liberal Society. Lee voluntarily undergoes extreme bodybuilding. Alternatives (moderate exercise, inactivity) are socially available and not stigmatized; the choice enhances some agency capacities and curtails none. Access Constraint satisfied; preference autonomous.\n\nc. Orthodox Nuns. Sister Maria takes a lifelong vow of obedience and enclosure. Did she have genuine exposure to secular life? Suppose she had higher education and years outside the convent; emotional aversions were not imposed by stigma but cultivated through discernment. Constraint criteria are not met; preference is autonomous, even though the content involves self-subordination.\n\nd. Gambian Women and FGC. Anthropologists report that many women defend female genital cutting as honorable. However, anti-FGC discourse is legally suppressed; uncircumcised women suffer marriage exclusion and communal shame. The preference thus rests on systematically blocked alternatives regarding marriageability and bodily integrity; autonomy deficit diagnosed.\n\nThese examples show the discriminatory power of the hybrid test, something neither pure content nor pure subjectivist nor pure historical accounts achieve alone.\n\n9. Comparative Assessment of the Three Models\n\nCriterion 1: Diagnostic Accuracy. Critical historicism explains both the happy slave and the autonomous monk. Subjectivism mislabels the happy slave; content theories mislabel the monk; historical theories wobble on the monk if her socialization involved religion. \n\nCriterion 2: Respect for Agency. Subjectivism excels, content theories risk paternalism. Critical historicism respects agency by proposing horizon-expanding rather than preference-replacing interventions.\n\nCriterion 3: Policy Guidance. Content theories yield checklists (capabilities); subjectivism yields none; historical theories call for procedural reforms. Critical historicism directs policy toward dismantling imaginative and affective barriers\u2014schooling girls, destigmatizing divorce, information campaigns\u2014which overlaps with but is not exhausted by capability provision.\n\n10. Objections from Theoretical Minimalism\n\nSome libertarians argue that any autonomy test beyond non-coercion is too demanding. If the agent is not physically forced or deceived, her preference should stand. My reply is that oppression often operates through soft power: controlling information, inculcating shame. Leaving such mechanisms outside the autonomy rubric reproduces injustice in measurement. Moreover, minimalism cannot explain our strong intuition that Jerome is not simply another market actor.\n\n11. Is a Fully Content-Neutral Historical Test Possible?\n\nCould we purge even the \u201cagency-enhancement\u201d clause? Probably not. Any historical criterion that singles out oppressive pathways tacitly relies on substantive judgments about what counts as a loss. For instance, why is patriarchal inculcation distorting but culinary upbringing benign? Because the former curtails practical agency. Hence a thin slice of content must re-enter. The proposed hybrid acknowledges this inevitable circularity and makes it explicit.\n\n12. Implications for Development Ethics\n\nIf adaptive preferences are autonomy-deficient, welfare assessments that rely solely on stated satisfaction underestimate deprivation. Policymakers should therefore:\n\n\u2022 Supplement preference surveys with capability audits.  \n\u2022 Create spaces for deliberative reflection among the disadvantaged.  \n\u2022 Treat observed compliance with oppressive norms as pro tanto evidence of autonomy deficit, warranting external support, not external override.\n\n13. Conclusion\n\nAdaptive preferences are less than fully autonomous not simply because their content is servile, nor merely because the agent now endorses them, nor exclusively because they arose under constraint. The deficit arises when oppressive histories have deprived the agent, in a continuing way, of the imaginative and emotional resources needed to appraise alternatives that matter for her practical agency. Subjectivist, content, and historical accounts each capture a facet of this diagnosis, but only a critically historicist synthesis explains the phenomenon in all its complexity while avoiding paternalist overreach. Recognizing this nuance helps political philosophers craft both respectful and justice-promoting responses to the real-world problem of adaptive preferences under oppression.", "output_tokens": 3196, "reasoning_tokens": 256}

Setting the Problem  \n\nAcross very different contexts\u2014Sen\u2019s Rajasthani women who report preferring to eat last and least, formerly enslaved people who express nostalgia for bondage, girls in rural Turkey who say they \u201cprefer\u201d early marriage\u2014agents confronted with severely limited options often come to want exactly what their circumstances allow.  Call such wants adaptive preferences.  They create an intuitive puzzle.  On the one hand, respect for autonomy seems to require taking people\u2019s stated preferences seriously.  On the other hand, these very preferences strike many of us as \u201cnot really theirs,\u201d or at least as less than fully autonomous, because they have been sculpted by deprivation or domination.  \n\nHow should we diagnose the autonomy deficit?  Three families of answers dominate the literature:  \n\n\u2022 Subjectivist or endorsement accounts, epitomised by Harry Frankfurt, locate autonomy in the agent\u2019s reflective endorsement of a desire.  \n\u2022 Content\u2010based (or substantive) accounts claim that certain desires are autonomy\u2010defeating just in virtue of what they aim at\u2014e.g., servitude, self\u2010harm, moral wrongdoing.  \n\u2022 Historical or procedural accounts say the crucial factor is *how* the preference was formed: if the causal history involves manipulation, coercion, or oppressive socialisation, autonomy is compromised even if the agent now endorses it.  \n\nMy thesis is threefold:  \n\n(1) Purely subjectivist accounts cannot explain the deficit, because the mechanism of adaptation typically includes higher\u2010order endorsement; they therefore misclassify many adaptive preferences as autonomous.  \n\n(2) Purely content\u2010based accounts conflate autonomy with well\u2010being or morality: they correctly tell us that oppressive preferences are *bad*, but not why they are *inauthentic*.  They court paternalism by refusing to respect an agent who embraces a life we judge worthless.  \n\n(3) A refined historical\u2013relational view does best.  What undermines the autonomy of adaptive preferences is not their content, nor a lack of reflective approval in the present, but the domination\u2010laden process that shaped the agent\u2019s evaluative horizon.  The preferences are \u201ctheirs,\u201d yet they are not *self\u2010governing* in a deeper sense, because the social environment systematically deprived the agent of the *power to imagine and assess alternatives*.  \n\nAfter clarifying key concepts (section 2), I scrutinise each family of accounts (sections 3\u20135) and develop a positive historical\u2013relational proposal (section 6).  Section 7 replies to two important objections.  I close by sketching implications for policy and personal interaction (section 8).\n\n2. Clarifying Autonomy, Preference, and Adaptation  \n\n2.1 Three Faces of Autonomy  \nPhilosophers have distinguished at least three ideals:  \n\na. Authenticity: is the preference genuinely the agent\u2019s own?  \nb. Self\u2010governance: does the agent originate and sustain it through practical reasoning?  \nc. Independence from domination: is the preference free from controlling social power?  \n\nThese facets often overlap but can pull apart.  An ascetic monk may authentically and reflectively prefer celibacy (a, b) yet be embedded in a hierarchical order that makes dissent unthinkable (c).  Adaptive preference cases are most troubling when they implicate all three deficits, but focusing the lens on (c) will prove decisive.\n\n2.2 Preferences, Desires, and Judgements  \n\u201cPreference\u201d is ambiguous.  I will use it broadly for any ranked motivational state\u2014desires, value judgements, plans\u2014that disposes an agent to choose one option over another.  \n\n2.3 Adaptation Mechanisms  \nPsychologists catalogue several:  \n\n\u2022 Rational revision: recognising constraints, I drop unattainable aims (scaling ambitions).  \n\u2022 Sour grapes rationalisation: I devalue the unattainable to reduce cognitive dissonance.  \n\u2022 Internalised norms: through social learning and sanction, I come to *value* what the powerful want me to value.  \n\nOnly the last two plausibly threaten autonomy.  Rational revision is compatible with full self\u2010direction; indeed it may embody practical wisdom.  The challenge is to weed out mere coping from autonomy\u2010undermining deformation.\n\n3. Subjectivist / Frankfurtian Accounts  \n\nFrankfurt (1971) famously locates autonomy in hierarchical endorsement: a desire is \u201cwholeheartedly\u201d mine when I approve of it on reflection.  The view captures important data: compulsive desires, which agents typically disavow, turn out non\u2010autonomous; ordinary, reflectively endorsed desires qualify.  \n\nYet adaptive preferences often *are* second\u2010order endorsed.  Consider the Rajasthani woman who reports: \u201cI eat least because feeding others first is what a good wife wants.\u201d  She is not torn or ambivalent; she has integrated the norm into her identity.  Frankfurt\u2019s test pronounces the preference autonomous.  That seems the wrong verdict.\n\nWhy the mismatch?  The heart of the problem is that hierarchical endorsement is *diachronically thin*: it looks only at the agent\u2019s present structure of desires.  But reflective endorsement itself may be the product of moulding so pervasive that alternative second\u2010order attitudes were never live possibilities.  Frankfurt\u2019s machinery therefore treats \u201cinternalised servility\u201d as authentic, because it lacks another place to stand.  \n\nCould the subjectivist respond by adding a requirement of *ideal* reflection under better information?  Two difficulties loom.  First, better information alone may not affect adaptive preferences: the woman already knows other cultures feed women first; she just sees no reason to value that practice.  Second, as the idealisation becomes more demanding, the view threatens to collapse into a disguised substantive account: we declare that a desire counts as \u201cendorsed\u201d only when it converges on what we antecedently take to be valuable.\n\n4. Content\u2010Based Accounts  \n\nMartha Nussbaum\u2019s capability approach calls certain preferences \u201cdeformed\u201d because they aim at lives below a threshold of human flourishing.  The view is powerful for distributive justice: it underwrites a robust defence of intervention on behalf of oppressed groups.  But as an account of *autonomy deficits* it faces three problems.\n\n4.1 Conflation with Well\u2010Being  \nSuppose Ali chooses dangerous mountaineering fully aware of the risks.  The content leads to harm, but the choice can be autonomous.  Conversely, a woman choosing housework over paid labour under patriarchal pressure might avoid harm, yet her choice seems less self\u2010directed.  Content and autonomy can thus come apart.\n\n4.2 Paternalism and Diversity  \nDeclaring certain life plans nonautonomous because they offend liberal sensibilities (e.g., choosing a cloistered religious life, BDSM relationships, or filial piety) risks disrespecting cultural pluralism.\n\n4.3 The \u201cNormative Double Vision\u201d Problem  \nIn many adaptive preference contexts the *content* is not intrinsically objectionable.  Preferring to eat last is benign in an egalitarian family where everyone takes turns.  The problem is the social meaning of the practice under conditions of gender hierarchy.  A content\u2010based test cannot capture that.\n\n5. Historical (Procedural) Accounts  \n\nHistorical views focus on the genesis of the preference.  The simplest version says: a desire is autonomous if it was formed through a process free of coercion, manipulation, or indoctrination.  This intuitively tracks our verdicts about adaptive preferences.  Yet we must articulate the triggering conditions carefully; otherwise, every social influence threatens autonomy, an implausible result given that all preferences are socially shaped.  \n\n5.1 The Causal\u2010History Test  \nGerald Dworkin\u2019s early proposal required simply that the agent could have \u201cwiped out\u201d the preference through critical reflection.  But adaptive preferences often persist because the agent never acquires the conceptual resources to query them.  So the criterion must be strengthened.\n\n5.2 Christman\u2019s Hypothetical Reflection  \nJohn Christman (1991) adds that the preference must be resistant to reflection *under conditions free of self\u2010doubting manipulation*.  Yet the worry resurfaces: how do we specify such hypothetical conditions without smuggling in substantive values?\n\n5.3 Relational Autonomy  \nRelational theorists (Friedman, Oshana, Meyers) suggest the answer lies in *social power relations*.  Autonomy requires not atomistic independence but relations that do not involve domination.  Preferences forged in contexts of oppression lack autonomy because the agent\u2019s dialogical environment forecloses critical uptake of alternative values.\n\nThis move respects two intuitions at once: (a) socialisation can enhance autonomy when it is dialogically open (e.g., mentoring relationships); (b) certain forms of socialisation systematically stifle self\u2010governance.\n\n6. A Refined Historical\u2013Relational Proposal  \n\nI now sketch a positive account that explains the autonomy deficit of adaptive preferences while avoiding paternalism and hyper\u2010idealisation.\n\n6.1 The Core Idea  \nA preference is less than fully autonomous to the extent that *(i)* its formation depended on social relations of domination that *(ii)* deprived the agent of robust opportunities to encounter, imagine, and assess meaningful alternatives, where *alternatives* are defined expansively to include rival practical identities, not merely different consumer goods.\n\n6.2 Operationalising the Conditions  \n\na. Domination: a standing power differential that enables some to interfere arbitrarily in others\u2019 choices (Pettit 1997).  Oppression qualifies: patriarchy, racism, class exploitation.  \n\nb. Opportunity set: More than physical opportunities; it includes epistemic and imaginative access.  Hermeneutical deprivation (Fricker) counts: if a battered wife lacks the very concept of marital rape, her preference to \u201csubmit\u201d is formed in ignorance of an alternative description of her experience.  \n\nc. Robust Encounter: Mere awareness that foreigners live differently is insufficient; the agent must have non\u2010stigmatized avenues for engaging, discussing, and experimenting with alternatives without prohibitive costs.  \n\n6.3 Degrees, Not a Binary  \nAutonomy is scalar.  Preferences formed under mild, non\u2010pervasive domination (say, advertising) may be only slightly tainted; those formed under chattel slavery are deeply compromised.\n\n6.4 Why This Avoids Paternalism  \nThe test focuses on the *process*, not the content.  If a woman after freely exploring options still chooses domesticity, her preference counts autonomous\u2014even if liberals disapprove.  Conversely, even a preference for something apparently innocent (silence, solitude) can lack autonomy if forged under an abusive regime that punishes speech.\n\n6.5 Examples that Do Work  \n\u2022 Early Marriage in Rural Turkey: Because girls who refuse jeopardise family honour and face social exile, the preference forms under domination that blocks robust encounter with alternatives.  Autonomy deficit: high.  \n\n\u2022 Urban Professional Who Loves High\u2010Heeled Shoes: Strong marketing plus beauty norms exert pressure, but she can experiment with flats without sanctions.  Autonomy deficit: low to medium; intervention unwarranted.  \n\n\u2022 Stockholm Syndrome Hostage: Domination is extreme and alternatives unthinkable; epistemic deprivation acute.  Autonomy deficit: near\u2010total.\n\n7. Replies to Objections  \n\nObjection 1: Idealising Opportunity Sets Is Unrealistic  \nNo one has \u201crobust\u201d exposure to every way of life; how then can anyone be autonomous?  \n\nReply: The standard is *relationally relative*.  We ask whether domination blocked access *relative to what was otherwise feasible* in that society.  You need not sample every cuisine to autonomously prefer ramen; you merely need a fair shot at acquiring information and trying alternatives without coercive penalties.\n\nObjection 2: The View Neglects Agency of the Oppressed  \nBy declaring adaptive preferences nonautonomous, do we erase the ingenious ways oppressed persons exercise agency?\n\nReply: Recognising autonomy deficits does not deny agency.  Adaptation can be creative resistance that makes life livable.  The claim is normative, not psychological: the preferences do not measure up to the standard of *self\u2010governance we owe one another*, hence society bears a duty to expand the agent\u2019s horizon.  Nothing follows about blaming the person or ignoring her coping strategies.\n\n8. Implications and Conclusion  \n\n8.1 Policy  \nA historical\u2013relational diagnosis supports interventions that enlarge opportunity sets\u2014education, safe migration channels, anti\u2010domination legal reforms\u2014rather than paternalistic prohibition of chosen practices.  For instance, outlawing early marriage *without* providing boarding schools and economic alternatives risks replacing one domination with another; autonomy gains require the latter.\n\n8.2 Personal Interaction  \nWhen encountering adaptive preferences, the respectful stance is *dialogical accompaniment*: invite conversation, share experiences, but refrain from coercive correction.  The goal is to create the social conditions under which the agent herself might revisit her preferences.\n\n8.3 Philosophical Payoff  \nThe account vindicates both intuitions that motivate the debate: (i) we owe prima facie respect to stated preferences, because they matter to the agent\u2019s identity; yet (ii) we can still criticise them as autonomy\u2010deficient when their formation is traceable to relations of domination that truncated the agent\u2019s evaluative space.\n\nBy anchoring autonomy in the historical\u2010relational matrix rather than in inner endorsement or in substantive value, we explain what makes adaptive preferences less than fully autonomous without collapsing into moralism or neglecting social power.  The upshot is a picture of autonomy as *freedom\u2010enabled self\u2010construction*: agents are most fully self\u2010governing when they can shape their preferences against a backdrop of social relations that do not predetermine the contours of their imagination.  Where domination narrows that imaginative field, adaptation is understandable, often dignified\u2014but never the last word on what the self might become.", "output_tokens": 3618, "reasoning_tokens": 704}

Introduction: The Puzzle About Adaptive Preferences  \n\nMany oppressive social orders survive because those who are disadvantaged within them appear to want precisely the lives they are allowed to lead. Amartya Sen reports that under-fed women in rural Bengal sincerely judge their own hunger \u201cnormal,\u201d and lower-caste Indians sometimes prefer the most degrading tasks that the caste hierarchy assigns them. Call these adaptive preferences: stable, apparently wholehearted preferences whose very content tracks a background of restricted options. They raise a familiar worry. Autonomy, at least since Kant, is usually thought to require that what we choose be in some sense \u201cours.\u201d But when a person\u2019s valuational landscape has been pruned by sexism, racism, or poverty, in what sense are the resulting preferences really hers?  \n\nThis essay defends the following thesis: The autonomy deficit displayed by adaptive preferences is best explained by a historical-relational account that focuses on how the preference was formed under conditions of illegitimate power. Subjectivist or hierarchical theories misdiagnose the problem because they evaluate only the agent\u2019s current structure of endorsement, ignoring the way endorsement itself can be engineered. Purely content-based or substantive theories err in the opposite direction: they condemn the preference simply because of what it favors, sliding unwittingly into moralism or paternalism. A historically sensitive account, by contrast, pinpoints what is objectionable\u2014namely, the causal role of oppressive socialization\u2014and can do so without presuming to know better than the agent what she should value. Still, history must be paired with a procedural condition of \u201ccounterfactual reflectiveness\u201d: the agent must be able, here and now, to scrutinize her values in light of information and models to which she reasonably should have access. The upshot is a hybrid view: adaptive preferences are non-autonomous when they are (i) the products of unjust formative processes and (ii) kept in place by ongoing limits on reflective opportunities. I first clarify the phenomenon, then evaluate the three families of accounts, and finally articulate and defend the hybrid historical-reflective diagnosis.  \n\n2. The Phenomenon Unpacked  \n\nAn adaptive preference, \u00e0 la Jon Elster, is a stable disposition to choose option X over Y because Y has been judged unavailable or costly. The key is not immediate preference reversal under constraint\u2014that is mere behavior\u2014but the internalization of the constraint into what the agent now finds genuinely valuable. Classic illustrations:  \n\n\u2022 \u201cThe contented housewife\u201d: A woman socialised in patriarchal norms announces that she prefers domesticity to paid work and even resents feminist agitation.  \n\u2022 \u201cThe happy slave\u201d: A bonded laborer expresses gratitude for the discipline and security of his master\u2019s rule.  \n\u2022 \u201cCaged birds\u201d: Confined birds eventually stop trying to fly long distances and seem to favour hopping within the cage.  \n\nWhat offends our autonomy intuitions is that these agents are not coerced at the moment of choice; nevertheless, something about their endorsement looks \u201cspoiled from within.\u201d The puzzle is to say exactly what.  \n\n3. Subjectivist/Higher-Order Authority: Why Internal Endorsement Is Not Enough  \n\nFrankfurt\u2019s classic model distinguishes first-order desires (to smoke, to cook dinner) from second-order desires or volitions (desires about what first-order desires should move one). Autonomy, on this picture, consists in the alignment of effective first-order motives with endorsed second-order volitions. An agent who wholeheartedly wants her domestic role would, by definition, be autonomous.  \n\n3.1 The \u201cHappy Slave\u201d Challenge  \n\nYet the happy slave may satisfy Frankfurt\u2019s internal test: he wholeheartedly wants to want servitude. If the sole criterion is endorsement, the view collapses the very distinction we sought to capture; it deems the slave autonomous precisely because adaptation has succeeded.  \n\n3.2 The Regress and Wash-Out Problems  \n\nHierarchical views can reply that the slave\u2019s second-order endorsement is itself the product of manipulation or false consciousness. But once we climb to third-order or fourth-order volitions, two difficulties arise. (i) Regress: why privilege any given level? (ii) Wash-out: if each higher-order endorsement can itself be tampered with, the theory lacks resources to explain why the tampering matters. Something external\u2014history or content\u2014must do the normative work.  \n\n3.3 Counterfactual Endorsement  \n\nSome hierarchists introduce a modal twist: an endorsement counts only if the agent would retain it under ideal reflective circumstances. But once we build in \u201cideal reflection,\u201d we have smuggled in facts about information, social power, and historical constraints\u2014the very factors a pure subjectivist account wished to bracket.  \n\nVerdict: while hierarchical endorsement is a necessary ingredient in full autonomy (someone coerced against her will is plainly unfree), it is not sufficient to diagnose the deficit in adaptive preferences.  \n\n4. Content-Based or Substantive Accounts: The Scylla of Paternalism  \n\nSubstantive theorists, influenced by Kantian and perfectionist strands, argue that certain preferences are autonomy-blocking simply by virtue of what they aim at. A preference for slavery or self-debasement violates the agent\u2019s status as an end-in-herself, therefore cannot be autonomous.  \n\n4.1 Moralized Autonomy and Its Cost  \n\nThis yields tidy verdicts\u2014domesticity, if genuinely chosen, might still be non-autonomous if grounded in sexist norms\u2014but it does so by collapsing the distinction between autonomy and morality. That move carries two costs:  \n\n(a) It underwrites paternalism. Outsiders get to declare a preference non-autonomous whenever they deem its content morally repugnant.  \n(b) It fails to respect value pluralism. Agents may autonomously choose lives that perfectionists find unworthy. Consider monastic asceticism: ascetics relinquish many central capabilities, yet we intuitively regard them as capable of autonomous self-denial.  \n\n4.2 The Content Underdetermination Problem  \n\nFurther, content alone cannot distinguish adaptive from non-adaptive preferences among the oppressed. Two women adopt homemaking: one because she savours caretaking, another because sexism denied her market opportunities. The content is identical; what differs is the pathway. Hence a purely substantive test is underinclusive.  \n\n5. Historical-Relational Accounts: Formation Under Illegitimate Power  \n\nHistorical accounts (e.g., Marilyn Friedman, Natalie Stoljar, Marina Oshana) focus on whether the preference was produced by socialization processes that distort deliberation. Coercion in the past, systematic manipulation, or exclusion of alternatives can infect current preferences.  \n\n5.1 Causal vs. Responsibility Accounts  \n\nWe need to be precise about what aspect of history undermines autonomy. There are at least two candidates:  \n\n(i) Responsibility condition: The agent could not have avoided coming to prefer X, given the oppressive context, so she cannot be held self-determining for that preference.  \n(ii) Causal condition: The preference is causally dependent on unjust power relations; absent those relations, she likely would not have acquired it.  \n\nBoth converge on the thought that illegitimate power, not mere contingency, is the contaminant.  \n\n5.2 Comparative Advantage over Rivals  \n\nHistorical accounts evade the regress problem: one need not climb levels of volition if the formative story itself is defective. They also avoid paternalism: an outsider\u2019s disagreement with the content of the preference is irrelevant; what matters is the unjust pathway.  \n\n5.3 The \u201cReformed Slaveholder\u201d Objection  \n\nSuppose an adult, now fully informed, reflectively endorses a preference that originated in oppression. Does the stain persist? Historical purism would say yes, but that seems too rigid; humans can own and transform inherited values. So history is necessary but perhaps not sufficient; present-time reflective capacity must matter, too.  \n\n6. Toward a Hybrid Diagnosis: History + Counterfactual Reflectiveness  \n\nThe preceding discussion suggests a balanced test. A preference is non-autonomous when:  \n\nCondition 1: Oppressive Genesis  \nIt was formed via social processes that rendered salient only options compatible with the agent\u2019s subordination, or attached heavy sanctions to deviation.  \n\nCondition 2: Blocked Counterfactual Reflection  \nThose same structures continue, directly or indirectly, to prevent the agent from accessing information, social imaginaries, or discursive spaces in which the preference could be critically examined.  \n\nIf Condition 1 holds but Condition 2 no longer does\u2014say, the agent later encounters robust alternatives and still opts for domesticity\u2014her preference regains autonomy. Conversely, if Condition 2 holds but the genesis was innocuous (think of a benign childhood hobby that one was never encouraged to question), the preference is quirky but not oppressive.  \n\n6.1 Counterfactual Reflectiveness and Practical Agency  \n\nBy \u201ccounterfactual reflectiveness\u201d I mean the ability to consider oneself as a chooser among live, normatively meaningful alternatives. The requirement is modest: not that the agent actually canvass every life-plan, but that she could do so without disproportionate cost. Patriarchal cultures often block this by controlling education, punishing dissent, or framing aspiration as deviance.  \n\n7. Case Studies Revisited  \n\nCase 1: The Contented Housewife, Age 20  \nGenesis: raised in a village where girls\u2019 schooling ends at 10; media depict working women as immoral; husbands may beat wives who seek employment. Current access: no internet, no role models, physical danger for dissent. Both conditions hold; preference non-autonomous.  \n\nCase 2: The Former Housewife, Age 35  \nShe migrates to a city, completes adult education, befriends professional women, experiments with part-time work, and decides she prefers homemaking after all. Condition 1 holds but 2 fails; preference now autonomous.  \n\nCase 3: The Ascetic Monk  \nGenesis involves voluntary initiation after exposure to diverse views; the monastery permits exit. Oppressive genesis fails; no autonomy deficit despite austere content.  \n\n8. Engaging Objections  \n\nObjection A: The Standard of \u201cReasonable Alternatives\u201d is Elitist  \nReply: The standard is relational, not absolutist. It asks whether the agent is denied access compared to her similarly situated peers in a non-oppressive society. This embeds sensitivity to socio-economic context without dictating Western liberal options.  \n\nObjection B: The View Still Licenses Paternalism  \nReply: It licenses only relational criticism, not substitution of judgment. Remedy focuses on dismantling structural barriers\u2014expanding education, legal protections\u2014rather than overriding the agent\u2019s choices. Autonomy is restored by enlarging the agent\u2019s space for reflection, not by dictating outcomes.  \n\nObjection C: The \u201cToo Demanding\u201d Worry  \nMust a preference be scrutinized under all possible counterfactuals to count as autonomous? No. The agent need only have had real opportunities for critical engagement\u2014conversation, role models, dissenting narratives\u2014not a philosopher\u2019s complete survey.  \n\n9. Comparative Evaluation  \n\nWhy does the hybrid historical-reflective account outperform rivals?  \n\n\u2022 Versus pure subjectivism: It explains why wholehearted endorsement does not suffice\u2014because endorsement itself can be a product of domination.  \n\u2022 Versus content accounts: It avoids judging by alien lights; it can deem an ascetic or nationalist preference autonomous if properly formed.  \n\u2022 Versus bare historical accounts: It allows for human self-correction; people can reclaim values after oppressive origins if later reflection is open.  \n\n10. Implications for Policy and Ethics  \n\nThe diagnosis matters because it guides interventions. If the autonomy deficit lies in blocked reflection, the remedy is empowerment: education, legal rights, safe public spaces, representational diversity. Compensating the agent with money or forcibly redirecting her choices, by contrast, misses the mark. Moreover, the account counsels humility. Outsiders should first ask whether the relevant reflective opportunities exist before branding an avowed preference \u201cfalse consciousness.\u201d  \n\n11. Conclusion  \n\nAdaptive preferences appear to undermine autonomy not primarily because of their unpalatable content nor because the agent fails some abstract inner test, but because they bear the imprint of domination in their very formation and are insulated, by ongoing constraint, from critical re-evaluation. A satisfactory theory must therefore be diachronic\u2014sensitive both to the historical genealogy of a preference and to the agent\u2019s present reflective horizon. The hybrid historical-reflective model meets these demands. It honors the agent\u2019s capacity to own values once oppression loosens its grip, yet it squarely indicts preferences that remain captive to a social order that deprives persons of the genuine freedom to think otherwise. Autonomy, on this view, is not simply a matter of what one happens to want; it is a relational achievement forged in the crucible of just social conditions.", "output_tokens": 3338, "reasoning_tokens": 640}

The Problem in View  \n\nAmartya Sen noticed something puzzling about deprivation: the agents who endure it often appear satisfied. Indian village women declared themselves \u201cwell-fed,\u201d though they routinely went hungry; impoverished sharecroppers ranked themselves above his own middle-class students in life satisfaction. Similar patterns arise when girls in patriarchal societies profess delight at early marriage, or sweat-shop laborers insist they \u201cprefer\u201d 14-hour shifts. Philosophers now call such attitudes adaptive preferences: doxastic and conative states that change so as to make a constrained life appear acceptable, even desirable.  \n\nAdaptive preferences create a dilemma. Autonomy, on the liberal tradition, normally requires attitudes that are in some important sense \u201cone\u2019s own.\u201d Yet if we grant full authority to every sincerely endorsed desire, we risk entrenching oppression: the undernourished woman\u2019s reflective endorsement would oblige us to treat her condition as self-chosen. If, however, we simply dismiss her preference as heteronomous, we incur the charge of paternalism and disrespect.  \n\nWhich underlying feature of adaptive preferences generates their autonomy deficit? Three explanatory families dominate the literature.  \n\nSubjectivist or internalist accounts (Frankfurt, Dworkin, autonomy as hierarchical endorsement) locate authority in an agent\u2019s higher-order approval of first-order desires.  \n\nContent-based accounts (Raz\u2019s perfectionism, Nussbaum\u2019s capability theory, some feminist critiques) judge autonomy partly by the moral or prudential quality of the ends pursued.  \n\nHistorical-process accounts (Mele, Christman, Mackenzie, Oshana) assess the pedigree of a preference: how it was produced, whether through manipulation, coercion, or oppressive socialization.  \n\nMy thesis: while each family captures an aspect of the phenomenon, only a specifically relational-historical account\u2014one that tracks the formative influence of unjust social power on preference formation\u2014can explain why adaptive preferences of the oppressed are substantially non-autonomous, whereas garden-variety accommodations (getting used to a smaller apartment, switching from wine to beer) are not. Subjectivist endorsement is too thin; content-based evaluation is too perfectionist; historical process, when refined to include the relational dimension of oppression, pinpoints the autonomy deficit without erasing the agent\u2019s voice.  \n\nI defend this thesis as follows. Section 2 clarifies the target notion of adaptive preference and autonomy. Sections 3\u20135 examine in turn the subjectivist, content, and historical strategies, diagnosing their strengths and limits. Section 6 develops the relational-historical model. Section 7 replies to three major objections. Section 8 concludes.\n\n2. Adaptive Preference and Autonomy: Conceptual Ground\u2010Clearing  \n\n2.1 Adaptive Preference  \nA preference is adaptive when: (i) it arises in response to restrictions on feasible options; (ii) those restrictions are not themselves freely chosen; and (iii) the preference makes the status quo appear positively desired rather than merely tolerated. What matters for autonomy is not mere change of taste but the etiology: the preference functions to reconcile the agent to a constraint.  \n\n2.2 Autonomy  \nAutonomy, on most contemporary accounts, involves:  \n(a) Self-government\u2014actions flow from the agent\u2019s own motivational economy, not from alien influences.  \n(b) Critical authority\u2014the agent can reflect on, evaluate, and, if appropriate, revise her motivations.  \n(c) Independence from domination\u2014the agent\u2019s capacities for reflection are not themselves shaped by illegitimate power.  \n\nThe controversy is over which of these elements is fundamental.  \n\n3. Subjectivist (Hierarchical) Accounts  \n\nFrankfurt claims that a desire is autonomous if the agent decisively identifies with it. Higher-order volitions confer authority. On this view the hungry woman\u2019s preference to feed her children before herself, if wholeheartedly endorsed, is as autonomous as any millionaire\u2019s taste for caviar.  \n\n3.1 Why Subjectivism Appears Attractive  \n\u2022 Respects first-person authority.  \n\u2022 Avoids paternalistic content judgments.  \n\u2022 Explains why coerced desires (the addict\u2019s craving he hates) lack autonomy.  \n\n3.2 Why Subjectivism Fails for Adaptive Preferences  \nFirst, endorsement can itself be adaptive; higher-order attitudes are not insulated from the very constraints that warped first-order desires. A village woman who has never imagined genuine gender equality may wholeheartedly endorse a servile role. Nothing in Frankfurt\u2019s structure marks that identification as suspect.  \n\nSecond, the approach misfires in the opposite direction. Some preferences formed under oppression are *not* adaptive\u2014e.g., a slave\u2019s desire for liberty\u2014yet may not enjoy wholehearted endorsement because of internalized fear. Frankfurt would wrongly withhold autonomy.  \n\nThird, subjectivism mislocates the explanatory weight. We suspect adaptive preferences are defective not primarily because the agent fails some introspective test but because the social process that gave rise to them was morally tainted. Hierarchical endorsement, silent on history, cannot register this.  \n\n4. Content-Based Accounts  \n\nRaz and Nussbaum propose that certain objective goods are necessary conditions of autonomy: adequate education, bodily integrity, practical reason, etc. A preference that conflicts with those goods\u2014say, a woman\u2019s desire for genital cutting\u2014would lack authority.  \n\n4.1 Merits  \n\u2022 Captures intuitions that slavery, mutilation, and servility are autonomy-undermining regardless of endorsement.  \n\u2022 Provides normative direction for policy (e.g., capability thresholds).  \n\n4.2 Problems  \n(a) Pluralism. Reasonable persons differ about the good life; content tests risk parochialism. Is preferring monastic poverty adaptive or admirable?  \n\n(b) Over-inclusiveness. Some innocuous adaptive shifts\u2014preferring tea to coffee because coffee is scarce\u2014fail the oppression test yet pose no autonomy worry. Content accounts must declare which goods are foundational, a controversial enterprise.  \n\n(c) Failure to discriminate etiology. Two agents might pursue the same objectively suboptimal end, one as a creative experiment, the other from deprivation. Autonomy should vary with origin. Content accounts treat them alike.  \n\n(d) Paternalism. Declaring a preference non-autonomous because it violates expert-defined goods silences dissenting conceptions of value.  \n\nThe content strategy thus gets the verdicts right in paradigmatic cases but for the wrong reasons and at unacceptable theoretical cost.  \n\n5. Historical Accounts  \n\nHistorical theorists hold that a preference is autonomous only if its formation bypassed disqualifying causal pathways\u2014manipulation, brainwashing, coercion, oppressive socialization that blocks critical reflection. Christman adds a hypothetical, *reflective access* clause: the agent would not repudiate the desire upon sustained, informed self-examination free of such constraints.  \n\n5.1 Advantages  \n\u2022 Explains why ordinary, non-coercive social influence (parenting, advertising) is compatible with autonomy: those processes do not foreclose critical options.  \n\u2022 Centers on agents\u2019 epistemic position and capacities rather than on external conformity or content.  \n\u2022 Fits with relational theories of freedom, which stress domination and dependency.  \n\n5.2 Remaining Difficulties  \n(i) Scope. Which social influences count as disqualifying? Socialization is ubiquitous; drawing the line without collapsing into total skepticism is tricky.  \n\n(ii) Evidence. Counterfactuals about what the agent \u201cwould do\u201d under ideal reflection are epistemically indeterminate and susceptible to paternalistic projection.  \n\n(iii) Ratification. Suppose a woman raised in a patriarchal context later gains full information and still endorses her homemaker preference. Is that attitude autonomous? Intuition divides. Historical accounts need a criterion for \u201cnon-alienating\u201d retention.  \n\nThese worries can be met, I submit, by enriching the historical model with an explicitly relational analysis of oppression.\n\n6. The Relational-Historical Model  \n\n6.1 Core Claim  \nAn adaptive preference is autonomy-deficient when\u2014and because\u2014its formation is causally structured by unjust social power in a way that systematically restricts the agent\u2019s imaginative access to alternatives, disables her critical capacities, and secures her cooperation in her own subordination. Such a pedigree stains the preference\u2019s authority even if the agent now endorses it.  \n\n6.2 Relational Premise  \nOppression is not merely the aggregate of constraints but a network of power relations. Patriarchy shapes women\u2019s desires via social norms, threat of sanction, and internalized scripts. Racism, class domination, ableism function analogously. Autonomy deficits arise when preference formation is not merely influence but domination: the agent\u2019s evaluative faculties are co-opted to serve others\u2019 interests.  \n\n6.3 Three Diagnostic Conditions  \nA preference P of agent S is non-autonomous when:  \n\n(1) Constraint-Etiology: P originated in systematic, non-accidental constraints imposed by a dominating group or structure.  \n\n(2) Imaginative Foreclosure: The formative process suppressed or obscured salient, realistically attainable alternatives that would rival P.  \n\n(3) Resistance-Fragility: Under conditions that lift those constraints and restore full deliberative capacity, there is a significant probability that S would revise or abandon P.  \n\nCondition (3) replaces Christman\u2019s vague counterfactual with an empirically tractable notion: \u201csignificant probability\u201d can be estimated by observing similarly situated agents once oppressive conditions are relaxed (e.g., when women gain education, many preferences shift).  \n\n6.4 Why the Model Works  \n\n\u2022 Differentiation: It distinguishes harmful adaptive preferences (girls preferring FGM) from innocuous ones (switching beverages) because only the former stem from domination.  \n\n\u2022 Respect: It leaves room for autonomous endorsement of traditional roles when the above conditions fail\u2014say, an educated woman freely choosing homemaking.  \n\n\u2022 Non-paternalism: The evaluative judgment tracks social injustice, not substantive ideals of the good life.  \n\n\u2022 Reform Guidance: Remedy for autonomy deficit is structural change (expanding options), not merely therapeutic persuasion.  \n\n6.5 Illustrative Cases  \n\nCase 1: Foot-Binding in Qing China.  \nEtiology: Patriarchal norms enforced by marital market.  \nForeclosure: Girls isolated, taught beauty ideals, never witness unbound feet.  \nResistance-Fragility: When laws and social attitudes changed in early 20th century, practice collapsed within a generation. Autonomy deficit explained.  \n\nCase 2: Urbanite preferring apartment to suburban house.  \nConstraint: High real\u2010estate prices.  \nForeclosure: Alternatives are salient; agent aware of trade-offs.  \nResistance: Even if market changed, many urbanites would still prefer city. Preference likely autonomous.  \n\nCase 3: \u201cHappy slave\u201d literature.  \nPlantation ideology portrays slavery as natural order; slaves denied literacy.  \nHistorical model flags non-autonomy despite professed contentment: conditions (1)\u2013(3) satisfied.  \n\n7. Objections and Replies  \n\nObjection 1: The model relies on an empirical estimator (\u201csignificant probability of revision\u201d) that is vague.  \n\nReply: Vagueness is inevitable in autonomy assessments (compare legal \u201creasonable person\u201d). Yet social science can provide robust indicators\u2014migration studies, liberation movements, controlled information exposure. Where evidence is indeterminate, we retain a defeasible presumption in favor of first-person authority, preserving respect.  \n\nObjection 2: Aren\u2019t you smuggling in perfectionism via the notion of \u201coppression\u201d? Maybe the agent *values* hierarchy.  \n\nReply: Oppression is defined relationally, not substantively. It involves asymmetrical power that systematically privileges one group\u2019s interests at another\u2019s expense and that the advantaged group has reason to conceal from the disadvantaged. This is not a controversial moral ideal but a structural fact recognizable across value-systems. An agent may sincerely value hierarchy, but if that valuation itself arose through domination satisfying conditions (1)\u2013(3), autonomy is compromised.  \n\nObjection 3: The account risks freezing identities: if preferences trace to historical injustice, are descendants forever heteronomous?  \n\nReply: The model is diachronic. Once dominating structures dissipate and agents have sustained access to alternatives, etiology alone no longer suffices; resistance-fragility fades. Cultural practices can be redeemed when adopted under non-dominating conditions. Thus contemporary foot fetish fashions, absent coercive patriarchy, may be autonomous.  \n\n8. Conclusion  \n\nAdaptive preferences expose a tension between respect for agency and critique of social power. Subjectivist endorsement accounts collapse the distinction between accommodation and autonomy; content-based views do the opposite, collapsing valuable diversity into perfectionist edicts. A relational-historical theory locates autonomy deficit precisely in the formative role of domination.  \n\nBy coupling a causal diagnosis (domination) with an epistemic test (imaginative foreclosure and resistance-fragility), the model explains both why adaptive preferences under oppression lack authority and how they can regain it once social conditions change. The proposal thus preserves the emancipatory impulse behind critiques of adaptive preference while honoring the first-person standpoint that any adequate theory of autonomy must respect.", "output_tokens": 3326, "reasoning_tokens": 576}

Introduction and Thesis\n\nMost adults treat their own preferences as authoritative reasons for action. Yet there are striking cases in which the very shape of a person\u2019s preference set seems to reveal an autonomy deficit: the woman in a patriarchal village who sincerely wants to undergo female genital cutting, the sweat-shop worker who \u201cprefers\u201d 16-hour shifts to schooling, the member of a despised caste who disdains higher education because it is \u201cnot for people like us.\u201d These are instances of what Jon Elster, Amartya Sen, and later feminist theorists call adaptive preferences\u2014preferences molded by prolonged exposure to a severely limited and oppressive menu of options. The philosophical puzzle is this: why, exactly, are such preferences less than fully autonomous? Three families of answers dominate the literature. Subjectivist models (Frankfurt, Dworkin) tie autonomy to the agent\u2019s higher-order identification with her first-order desires; content-based models see autonomy deficits in preferring objectively disvaluable ends; historical models ground the worry in the causal story by which the preference was formed. I will argue that (i) the standard subjectivist account misfires because reflective endorsement is itself typically colonised by oppressive socialisation; (ii) purely content-based accounts collapse into moralism and cannot explain why seemingly innocuous adaptive preferences (e.g. coming to like cabbage in a famine) may still be autonomy-defective; (iii) a suitably enriched historical account\u2014one that focuses on the agent-controlling effects of oppressive socialisation and offers procedural, not substantive, independence conditions\u2014best captures what is troubling about adaptive preferences. However, the historical model must be supplemented by a \u201ccapability for critical reflection\u201d condition: autonomy requires both that the preference not be produced by domination and that the agent now enjoys the epistemic and emotional capacities to interrogate it.  \n\n2. What Adaptive Preference Formation Looks Like\n\nAdaptive preferences differ from simple preference change. Suppose you move to Scotland and come to relish haggis; your culinary preference is adaptive but not suspect. By contrast, an adaptive preference of the troubling variety involves:\n\na) Constraint: the agent\u2019s feasible set is truncated by coercion, economic deprivation, or cultural stigma.  \nb) Incentive to rationalise: to reduce cognitive dissonance, the agent revises her desirability ranking so that the best of the remaining options now looks choice-worthy.  \nc) Internalisation: over time, the revised preference is experienced as one\u2019s own, not as a mere coping strategy.\n\nThis three-stage structure generates the intuition that something inauthentic has happened. Yet where does the deficit lie\u2014in endorsement, in content, or in the genealogy of the preference?\n\n3. The Subjectivist (Hierarchical) Model: Endorsement in a Colonised Inner Citadel\n\nOn Harry Frankfurt\u2019s canonical view, autonomy with respect to a desire D obtains when the agent has a second-order desire that D move her to action. All that matters, then, is wholehearted identification. An oppressed woman who reflectively endorses her desire to undergo foot-binding would count as autonomous, provided she is free from internal conflict.\n\nThe problem is that adaptive preference formation typically operates not by silencing second-order reflection but by colonising it. Social norms of feminine virtue, filial piety, or caste humility supply the very evaluative materials out of which second-order endorsements are made. The inner citadel is already occupied. Frankfurt\u2019s theory lacks a criterion for distinguishing between (i) identification that expresses the agent\u2019s authentic standpoint and (ii) identification that is itself a downstream product of manipulation. One might add a \u201cthird-order\u201d layer, but the regress merely reappears: higher-order endorsements can also be indoctrinated. Without a historical or external check, subjectivism licenses oppressive socialisation so long as it achieves psychic harmony.\n\nTwo moves are often attempted on Frankfurt\u2019s behalf. First, appeal to a hypothetical ideal of \u201cfully informed\u201d reflection. But adaptive preference cases involve not just absence of information; they involve distorted self-worth and imaginative horizons. Second, import a requirement that identification be formed \u201cfreely.\u201d Yet unless freedom is cashed out historically, this becomes circular. The subjectivist, then, lacks the resources to explain why wholehearted endorsement under oppression is suspect.\n\n4. Content-Based Accounts: Autonomy as Valuing the Right Things?\n\nSome theorists\u2014especially within liberal perfectionism\u2014treat autonomy failure as inhering in the object of preference: to be autonomous, a person must value ends that are choice-worthy, expansive, or self-developing. A desire for foot-binding or servitude is ipso facto non-autonomous because these ends are bad. The view scores an easy victory in paradigm cases, but at a cost.\n\nFirst, it confuses moral badness with autonomy. A terrorist\u2019s wholehearted, historically undistorted desire to murder innocents is deeply immoral yet might nonetheless be an expression of his autonomous agency. Symmetrically, some adaptive preferences have benign content\u2014e.g. coming to prefer starchy staples during a famine\u2014yet still look autonomy-defective because they reflect resignation to injustice. Content-based diagnostics thus over- and under-generate autonomy deficits.\n\nSecond, the approach is paternalistic in the pejorative sense: it entails that whenever experts deem a person\u2019s ends unworthy, she lacks autonomy and can be overridden. Feminist critics worry this repeats the very domination that produced the preferences.\n\nFinally, content-based criteria cannot explain why the same act (e.g. motherhood) can be autonomously chosen by one woman but non-autonomously adopted by another whose horizons were narrowed. The moral valence of the end is constant; what differs is the history.\n\nTherefore, while objective value matters for social justice, it is ill-suited as the focal explanatory variable for autonomy deficits in adaptive preferences.\n\n5. Historical Accounts: Autonomy and the Story of Causal Control\n\nHistorical models\u2014pioneered by Marilyn Friedman, John Christman, and later Natalie Stoljar\u2014locate autonomy in the genealogy of preference formation. On Christman\u2019s \u201cprocedural-independence\u201d proposal, a preference is autonomous if it was not produced by manipulation that bypasses the agent\u2019s rational capacities or by oppressive socialisation that systematically suppresses critical reflection. What undermines autonomy is not the content but the alienating etiology: the agent was never in a position to evaluate whether to adopt this preference.\n\nThis yields elegant explanations of our intuitions:\n\nCase 1: Benign Content, Oppressive Production. A factory girl who prefers sewing to schooling because she has been told girls are too stupid for books. Content is innocuous (sewing) but the formation process involved epistemic deprivation and demeaning stereotypes; hence autonomy deficit.\n\nCase 2: Bad Content, Non-Oppressive Production. An affluent thrill-seeker who desires Russian roulette after careful reflection. Content is disvaluable; yet the preference stems from his own evaluative experiments. Autonomy is intact.\n\nCase 3: Paradigm Adaptive Preference. A village woman\u2019s wish for genital cutting is inculcated through threats of social ostracism and lack of alternative models. Autonomy deficit follows directly from the dominance of oppressive socialisation.\n\nHistorical models thus avoid the over- and under-reach of the other two accounts. They also furnish a non-regressive answer to the Frankfurt worry: it is not the presence of second-order endorsement that matters but whether the process by which even the highest-order attitudes were formed is under the agent\u2019s rational control.\n\n6. Two Objections to the Historical Model\n\nObjection 1: Everybody\u2019s preferences have social histories. If social influence suffices for non-autonomy, the notion empties out; nobody is autonomous.\n\nReply: The historical theorist distinguishes between ordinary, non-dominating socialisation and oppressive socialisation that (i) severely restricts access to countervailing evidence, (ii) operates through threats of harm or withdrawal of basic goods, and (iii) instils self-conceptions incompatible with equal moral standing. This is a difference in kind, not merely degree.\n\nObjection 2: Present-time neutrality. Suppose a woman formed her preference under oppression but is now emancipated, exposed to alternatives, and still chooses the same option. Does historical taint still defeat autonomy?\n\nReply: The best version of the historical view adds a \u201ccurrent competence\u201d rider: the agent must possess the capability to re-evaluate the preference under conditions of adequate information, critical reflection, and absence of coercive pressure. If she exercises that capability and re-endorses the preference, its earlier genesis no longer dominates\u2014autonomy is (re)established. Without this rider, the view risks ossifying people in perpetual heteronomy.\n\n7. Enriching the Historical Account: The Capability for Critical Reflection\n\nA convincing account of adaptive-preference autonomy deficits must integrate two insights:\n\na) Oppression warps preference formation in ways that bypass or stunt the agent\u2019s evaluative capacities.  \nb) Autonomy is a here-and-now status: it concerns the agent\u2019s current self-governing abilities.\n\nI therefore propose the following necessary and jointly sufficient conditions for autonomy with respect to a preference P:\n\n(1) Non-Oppressive Causal History: P was not produced by socialisation that relies on coercion, threat of basic-goods deprivation, or systemic epistemic blockade.  \n(2) Present Critical Reflection Capability: The agent now has (i) credible access to relevant alternatives, (ii) epistemic resources to imagine herself under those alternatives, and (iii) psychological safety to revise or retain P without punitive costs.\n\nAdaptive preferences formed under oppression fail (1). If the agent remains trapped in the oppressive context, she also fails (2). Even after emancipation, failing (2)\u2014for example because internalised self-loathing undercuts her deliberative capacities\u2014continues the autonomy deficit.\n\nThis hybrid historical-procedural criterion explains why policy interventions aimed at expanding real options and fostering consciousness-raising (e.g. women\u2019s literacy circles) enhance autonomy without imposing substantive ends. It also clarifies why brute coercion (\u201cWe know better; abandon your preference\u201d) is counterproductive: it merely substitutes one heteronomous causal pathway for another.\n\n8. Examples Doing Philosophical Work\n\nTake Nussbaum\u2019s often-cited case of the Rajastani woman who rejects paid labor because \u201cwomen who work bring shame.\u201d According to the hierarchical view, if she reflectively endorses her belief, her choice is autonomous; our intuition rebels. According to the content view, the end\u2014unpaid domesticity\u2014is not per se disvaluable. Only the historical-capability model pinpoints the issue: her preference flows from gendered shame norms enforced by threat of expulsion from her natal household (history) and she presently lacks safe forums to encounter alternative self-conceptions (capability). Empowerment programs that provide stipends for skill-training and peer support groups target exactly these deficits.\n\nConsider next an ostensibly parallel but autonomy-preserving scenario: a modern urban professional who, after surveying childcare options and career prospects, decides to become a stay-at-home parent. History condition (1) is met: no oppressive socialisation coerced her. Capability condition (2) is met: she could revise the decision without ostracism or starvation. The choice is plausibly autonomous, despite matching the \u201ccontent\u201d of the Rajastani woman\u2019s preference.\n\n9. Risky Implications and Further Payoffs\n\nDoes the historical-capability view license paternalistic override in the name of autonomy? Only derivatively. What it justifies is (a) negative duties to dismantle structures that generate oppressive socialisation, and (b) positive duties to supply contexts for safe critical reflection\u2014education, freedom of speech, economic security. It does not authorise substitution of the state\u2019s or NGO\u2019s substantive values for the agent\u2019s, once conditions (1) and (2) are secured. Hence the model respects liberal anti-paternalism while recognising the autonomy-distorting power of oppression.\n\nMoreover, the model illuminates non-oppressive adaptive preferences. Suppose a mountain climber loses a limb and comes genuinely to love adaptive sports rather than high-altitude peaks. The preference switch is history-bound (accident) and content-changed (no problem). Yet autonomy is preserved: the accident is not an agent-dominating social force, and the climber has ample opportunity for post-trauma reflection. We therefore explain, rather than stipulate, why this case lacks the autonomy deficit of oppressive adaptive preferences.\n\n10. Conclusion\n\nAdaptive preferences are autonomy-defective when\u2014and only when\u2014they are the upshot of oppressive socialisation that both engenders them and continues to deprive the agent of the epistemic and emotional resources to revisit them. Subjectivist endorsement theories cannot account for the political infiltration of higher-order desires; content-based theories mistake moral badness for heteronomy. Historical approaches, fortified with a present-capability requirement, best capture our judgments and guide emancipatory practice. This account respects persons as the ultimate authors of their lives while recognising that genuine authorship requires more than inner endorsement or right-thinking content: it requires a history and present context free from domination.", "output_tokens": 2987, "reasoning_tokens": 192}

Such cases\u2014ranging from plantation slaves who profess to \u201clove\u201d their masters, to girls in patriarchal villages who say they \u201cprefer\u201d early marriage\u2014press a stubborn question:  in what sense are these preferences less than fully autonomous?  Three main families of answers dominate contemporary debate.\n\n1.  Subjectivist or procedural accounts, exemplified by Harry Frankfurt\u2019s hierarchical model, locate autonomy in the agent\u2019s structure of endorsement: a desire is self-governing if the agent whole-heartedly identifies with it.  \n\n2.  Content\u2010based or substantive accounts, defended by Martha Nussbaum among others, test autonomy by the moral quality of what is desired:  a preference that tracks degrading or self-thwarting ends fails to be fully one\u2019s own.  \n\n3.  Historical or etiological accounts\u2014found in the work of Jon Elster, Serene Khader, Marina Oshana, and Paul Benson\u2014treat the genesis of a preference as decisive:  a desire produced by oppressive or manipulative conditions is pro tanto non-autonomous, however deeply the agent presently embraces it.\n\nI shall argue that neither pure subjectivism nor pure content-based approaches can satisfactorily explain why adaptive preferences typical of oppression lack autonomy.  A historically oriented, relational view, supplemented by a modest procedural requirement for present-day critical reflection, offers the most convincing diagnosis.  Roughly: a preference is autonomy-deficient to the degree that (i) it arose as a non-voluntary psychological adjustment to unjust constraints that the agent reasonably could reject, and (ii) those same constraints now deprive her of the informational and social resources needed to scrutinize the preference.  This thesis both honors the intuitive pull of the historical story and avoids the pitfalls\u2014paternalism, counterfactual opacity\u2014that critics fear.\n\nThe argument unfolds in five steps.  Section I reconstructs Frankfurt-style subjectivism and shows why wholehearted endorsement is compatible with severe heteronomy.  Section II assesses substantive or content-based proposals and argues that they blur the distinction between autonomy and welfare.  Section III develops the historical alternative and explains how it handles paradigm cases of adaptive preference.  Section IV meets three major objections\u2014paternalism, epistemic inaccessibility of causal history, and the charge of infinite regress\u2014by refining the view into a \u201crelational-historical\u201d account.  Section V closes by sketching practical upshots for policy and personal responsibility.\n\nI.  The Subjectivist (Procedural) Approach: Endorsement Without Independence\n\nFrankfurt\u2019s classic model (1971) defines autonomy in terms of a hierarchy of desires: a first-order desire is autonomous iff the agent has a second-order desire to have (or to be moved by) that first-order desire, and no higher-order conflicts unsettle her identification.  Subsequent proceduralists\u2014Gerald Dworkin, Laura Ekstrom, and David Velleman\u2014develop similar structures emphasizing reflection, coherence, or reasons that the agent herself can endorse.  What matters is not *what* is desired but *how* the desire nests within the psyche.\n\nAt first glance, the model appears tailor-made for adaptive preferences.  Suppose Lindiwe, a woman raised in an isolated rural community with no realistic economic prospects, says she *wants* early marriage and many children\u2014and, at a reflective remove, declares she *wants* to want these things.  On Frankfurt\u2019s test, Lindiwe\u2019s preference enjoys full autonomy; she endorses it wholeheartedly.  Yet, many find it implausible that her wanting is entirely self-governing, because (a) her preference arose under severe informational and material deprivation, (b) it serves the very social structures that constrain her options, and (c) she could not easily cultivate or evaluate alternative ideals of life.\n\nThe proceduralist may reply that Lindiwe\u2019s endorsement is corrupted by *coercive* socialization: she could not have rejected the preference without sanctions or ostracism, so endorsement is not truly free.  But Frankfurt\u2019s own analytic machinery lacks the resources to register that corruption unless its traces persist as *psychic* conflict.  If social power succeeds so well that the agent experiences no internal ambivalence, the hierarchical test yields a false-positive for autonomy.  The approach therefore threatens to turn social domination into an *explanatory black hole*: once oppression colonizes the higher orders of desire, nothing in the procedure detects alien control.\n\nTwo further problems deepen the worry.\n\n1.  Wholehearted endorsement can be *manufactured* by subtle manipulation\u2014consider Robert Goodin\u2019s example of a state that bombards citizens with propaganda until they \u201cfreely\u201d embrace the party line.  Frankfurt\u2019s model cannot distinguish this from genuine self-governance.  \n\n2.  Proceduralist theories depend on an internal vantage point, but adaptive preferences are precisely those whose suspect origins lie in the *external* environment.  Even scrupulous first-person scrutiny may miss the relevant heteronomy.\n\nHence, while endorsement is plausibly *necessary* for autonomy\u2014it captures the agent\u2019s felt ownership\u2014it is not *sufficient*.  The subjectivist diagnosis leaves the fox\u2019s sour-grape preference entirely up to the fox, missing the explanatory role of the fence.\n\nII.  The Content-Based Approach: Autonomy Versus Flourishing\n\nFaced with these shortcomings, some theorists point to the *substantive* content of the preference.  Martha Nussbaum, in Women and Human Development, proposes a list of central human capabilities.  Preferences that renounce or undermine these thresholds, she argues, betray a failure of autonomy because they reflect adaptation to deprivation.  On this view, Lindiwe\u2019s desire for early marriage is non-autonomous because it blocks her pursuit of education, political participation, and bodily integrity\u2014goods she has a moral claim to enjoy.\n\nSubstantive theories score an important victory: they explain why adaptive desires are suspicious even when internally endorsed.  Nonetheless, they face three persistent objections.\n\n1.  The conflation problem:  autonomy and well-being are different.  Someone might autonomously choose a course detrimental to welfare (e.g., the artist who opts for poverty to pursue her craft).  Content-based tests risk declaring such choices heteronomous merely because they harm the chooser\u2019s interests.  That seems conceptually sloppy.\n\n2.  The free-monk counterexample:  A cloistered monk voluntarily renounces sex, private property, and political agency\u2014capabilities on Nussbaum\u2019s list.  If his life choice flows from religious devotion and not coercive scarcity, most would deem it autonomous.  The content-test yields the wrong result unless ad hoc caveats are added.\n\n3.  Cultural pluralism:  Assessing autonomy by universal goods invites charges of paternalism.  Cannot a person autonomously value familial interdependence over individual independence?  Content-based theories must either water down their list to near triviality or accept paternalistic implications.\n\nIn short, while appealing for egalitarian policy, substantive accounts mislocate the autonomy failure.  The problem with Lindiwe\u2019s preference is not *what* she values but *why* she has come to value it under constrained and unjust circumstances.  The historical dimension still does the real explanatory work.\n\nIII.  The Historical (Etiological) Approach: Causal Pathways to Desire\n\nHistorical theories center autonomy in the genesis of a preference.  David Velleman\u2019s \u201cco-authorship\u201d condition, Paul Benson\u2019s \u201cresponsibility-compatibilist\u201d model, Marina Oshana\u2019s relational view, and Serene Khader\u2019s work on adaptive preferences all share a core insight:  A desire is non-autonomous if it results from processes that bypass or subvert the agent\u2019s critical capacities in ways she could reasonably resent.  The preference\u2019s present-tense endorsement and content are secondary; what matters is whether the agent *could have shaped* that preference under fair conditions of dialogue, information, and social power.\n\nConsider three stylized cases.\n\nCase A:  The Peasant Wife (from Nussbaum).  She says she *prefers* not to eat more than a scant amount so that her husband and sons can eat; she is also convinced that women who speak in public embarrass their families.\n\nCase B:  The Ghetto Youth (adapted from Jon Elster).  A teenager in a violent neighborhood claims he *does not want* to pursue higher education because \u201cbooks are for chumps.\u201d\n\nCase C:  The Voluntary Ascetic.  An urban professional, after years of exposure to varied lifestyles, freely chooses a life of radical simplicity and donates her fortune to charity.\n\nOn the historical view, A and B manifest autonomy deficits because their preferences were formed in response to resource deprivation, gender hierarchy, or peer violence\u2014factors that systematically curtailed the agent\u2019s exposure to live alternatives and punished deviance.  In contrast, C\u2019s preference, though similar in content to the peasant wife\u2019s dietary self-denial, was cultivated under conditions of choice, deliberation, and social respect.  Thus the historical lens cleanly separates autonomy from both endorsement and content.\n\nWhy does history matter morally?  Two overlapping answers emerge.\n\n(i)  Relational Justice:  Preferences produced by oppressive structures implicate *others* in the agent\u2019s psychology; they are not fully \u201chers\u201d because they carry the imprint of domination.  The injustice is social, not merely psychological.\n\n(ii)  Counterfactual Competence:  Autonomy involves the agent\u2019s capacity to assess, revise, and own her ends.  If that capacity was itself bent out of shape by formative constraints, present endorsement is epistemically unreliable.  The historical test functions like a quality-control check on the authenticity of desire.\n\nThis view, however, confronts three major objections.\n\n1.  Paternalism Redux:  To declare a preference heteronomous because of its causal history seems to license third parties to override the agent\u2019s choices \u201cfor her own good.\u201d\n\n2.  Epistemic Access:  How can we *know* whether a given preference stems from oppressive adaptation or genuine self-authorization?  Psychological histories are opaque.\n\n3.  Infinite Regress:  If a preference\u2019s autonomy depends on its lineage, must not the preferences that shaped the lineage be scrutinized, and so on indefinitely?\n\nSection IV refines the historical account to answer these challenges.\n\nIV.  The Relational-Historical Account: Autonomy as Critically Sustained Agency\n\nA.  Core Proposal  \n\nA preference P of agent A is autonomy-deficient to degree d if and only if:\n\n(H) Formation:  P originated as a non-voluntary adjustment to constraints C that (i) were imposed by social structures that unjustly limited A\u2019s feasible set, and (ii) would be repudiated by A under conditions of equal respect and information.\n\n(R) Reflection:  Because C persists (or its psychological residues persist), A currently lacks adequate epistemic and social resources to subject P to sustained critical scrutiny.  \n\nTogether, H and R capture both backward-looking and present competencies.  R is crucial: an agent whose oppressive upbringing left her with a suspect preference may, through later education and dialogue, achieve critical distance and reaffirm the preference.  In that event, the autonomy deficit can *diminish* or vanish.  Hence the view is non-fatalistic.\n\nB.  Reply to Paternalism\n\nThe account does not authorize intervention merely because a preference is adaptive; it licenses *empowerment*, not substitution.  The remedy for heteronomous history is to expand the agent\u2019s opportunity and deliberative horizon\u2014education, exposure to alternatives, legal rights\u2014so that she herself can reconsider.  Only if the preference directly violates the rights of others (e.g., a slave who \u201cprefers\u201d slavery for everyone) may coercive override be justified on independent grounds.\n\nC.  Epistemic Accessibility\n\nTrue, we rarely possess certitude about causal histories.  Still, we often glean *converging evidence*: demographic patterns, testimonial reports, developmental psychology, sociological data.  If nearly all women in a region who lack schooling \u201cprefer\u201d child marriage while those given schooling exhibit diverse preferences, an inference to adaptive formation is warranted.  Moreover, the relational-historical account yields policy guidance that is relatively insensitive to error: where we suspect adaptive preference, the recommended response (broaden opportunities, supply information, dismantle unjust constraints) is beneficial even if the initial diagnosis was uncertain.\n\nD.  Regress Avoidance\n\nThe regress dissolves once we note that autonomy is a *scalar* property.  The question is not whether some initial preference was *absolutely* uncaused\u2014an impossible standard\u2014but whether the lineage includes significant episodes of domination that the agent has not had a fair chance to reassess.  Each cycle of critical reflection can repair earlier deficits, so the chain does not run ad infinitum.\n\nE.  Comparative Advantages\n\n1.  It honors the intuitive pull of content critique without conflating autonomy and welfare: preferences hostile to flourishing are flagged as suspect when\u2014and because\u2014they plausibly owe their existence to oppressive history.\n\n2.  It preserves endorsement as a *current* requirement: agents can reclaim autonomy over partly adaptive preferences by critical reaffirmation under improved conditions.\n\n3.  It foregrounds power relations, a dimension muted in both procedural and substantive rivals.\n\nV.  Implications and Concluding Thoughts\n\nThe account illuminates three practical domains.\n\n1.  Development Policy:  When designing micro-credit, education, or health programs, the goal should be not to impose external ideals but to dismantle the background constraints that generate adaptive acquiescence.  Measuring \u201cpreference change\u201d is less important than securing the conditions under which any preference, including the status quo, could be autonomously re-endorsed or revised.\n\n2.  Legal Consent:  In contract, medical ethics, and sexual consent, the presence of ongoing structural coercion can taint apparently voluntary agreements.  Our view justifies enhanced safeguards (cooling-off periods, counseling, transparency) rather than categorical bans, thus balancing respect for agency with concern about autonomy deficits.\n\n3.  Moral Responsibility:  Agents whose preferences stem from adaptive self-subordination may still be morally responsible for their actions, but blame should be mitigated to the extent that oppressive histories narrow their evaluative horizons.  This nuance supports restorative, rather than retributive, approaches to wrongdoing in marginalized contexts.\n\nTo conclude, adaptive preferences are less than fully autonomous chiefly because of *how* they are formed and *why* they persist\u2014not because of their surface content nor solely because the agent presently embraces them.  A relational-historical account captures this fact by locating autonomy, and its deficits, at the intersection of personal psychology and social power.  It allows us to take individuals\u2019 avowals seriously while refusing to treat endorsement as the last word.  And it recommends remedies aimed at expanding, rather than overriding, the agent\u2019s own capacity for critical self-revision.  In the end, respecting autonomy requires more than listening to what people say they want; it demands attention to the fences that shape what they are able to imagine wanting at all.", "output_tokens": 3863, "reasoning_tokens": 640}

Sen\u2019s \u201chappy slave,\u201d the single\u2010option worker who hails her 18-hour shift as fulfilling, or the village girl who praises early marriage because nothing else is realistically available, are familiar examples. Though such agents avow their preferences sincerely, many philosophers sense that something about those preferences is \u201cless than fully autonomous.\u201d The task is to say what, exactly, is missing.\n\nThree families of accounts dominate the literature:\n\n1. Subjectivist or endorsement accounts, typified by Harry Frankfurt, locate autonomy in the agent\u2019s higher-order identification with her first-order desires.\n\n2. Content-based or substantive accounts locate autonomy in what is preferred\u2014roughly, the preference fails because it targets an unworthy object (servitude, mutilation, subordination, etc.).\n\n3. Historical or procedural accounts hold that autonomy turns on how the preference was formed\u2014whether its etiology involves manipulation, coercion, or oppressive socialization.\n\nMy thesis is threefold.\n\nA. Purely subjectivist models misdiagnose adaptive preferences because they treat wholehearted endorsement as sufficient for autonomy and therefore mistake the very success of oppressive socialization for evidence of freedom.\n\nB. Pure content-based models identify genuine normative failings\u2014oppressive preferences often do target bad or stunting ends\u2014but they blur together autonomy with morality, cannot explain adaptive preferences that fix on seemingly innocuous ends (e.g., learning to love cabbage because meat is unavailable), and risk an objectionable perfectionism.\n\nC. A refined historical account, enriched with a relational analysis of power, best captures the autonomy deficit. A preference is non-autonomous when its formation process systematically bypassed the agent\u2019s critical capacities by capitalizing on her dependence or vulnerability. What matters is not simply that the preference arose under constraints\u2014after all, all preferences do\u2014but that it was shaped by social mechanisms aimed at adjusting what the agent can imagine, evaluate, and eventually endorse. The hallmark of oppression is that it colonizes the very procedures through which endorsement would normally secure autonomy.\n\nThe remainder of the essay defends these claims. First I frame adaptive preference formation more precisely. Then I evaluate the three accounts in turn, showing how each handles key cases. I close by articulating a relational-historical model that diagnoses the autonomy deficit without collapsing into moral perfectionism, and I answer several objections.\n\n1. What Is an Adaptive Preference?\n\nJon Elster introduced the phrase by reference to Aesop\u2019s fox: unable to reach the grapes, the fox devalues them (\u201cthey\u2019re probably sour anyway\u201d). Psychological research confirms the robustness of \u201cpreference change under scarcity\u201d: dissonance reduction, focalism, and hedonic adaptation are normal human strategies. So mere adaptivity cannot be the problem. Indeed, agents often adapt autonomously\u2014think of the mountaineer who, after injury, discovers the joys of birdwatching.\n\nWhat distinguishes the troubling cases is that (i) the constraints are themselves unjust, typically products of social power, and (ii) the resulting preference tends to stabilize and legitimate the unjust structure. Adaptive preferences under oppression therefore have a dual function: they are coping mechanisms and ideological mechanisms. Any plausible autonomy analysis must register this duality.\n\n2. Subjectivist Endorsement Accounts: Why Wholeheartedness Is Not Enough\n\nFrankfurt\u2019s hierarchical model says that I act freely when my first-order desire (say, to scrub the floor) is one I want to have. Higher-order endorsement distinguishes the willing addict from the unwilling one, the freedom fighter from the brainwashed conscript. If a village girl sincerely wants early marriage and wants to want it, Frankfurt seems bound to call her preference autonomous.\n\nAdvocates reply that Frankfurtian endorsement must be procedurally robust: the higher-order desire cannot itself be the product of bypassing manipulation. Frankfurt himself gestures at \u201cdecisive identification,\u201d but he provides no machinery to detect illegitimate formation. The adaptive preference problem presses precisely on this lacuna.\n\nConsider three counterexamples.\n\nCase 1: The Happy Slave. Years of indoctrination make the slave wholeheartedly endorse servitude. Because indoctrination engineered the higher-order endorsement, the account needs an etiological condition\u2014but acknowledging that shows subjectivism alone is insufficient.\n\nCase 2: Internalized Misogyny. A woman in a patriarchal community not only wants to serve her husband but takes pride in wanting so. The preference sits coherently within her hierarchy of desires. Yet intuitively her autonomy is compromised, and the compromise traces to a socialization process that restricted what she could imagine a woman could decently want.\n\nCase 3: The Contented Sweatshop Worker. He values 18-hour shifts because, given systemic poverty, the alternative is starvation. He identifies with his work ethic; adaptation spares him bitterness. Still, the authenticity of endorsement looks hollow, because the options were coercively narrowed.\n\nThese cases reveal a systemic vulnerability: the more thorough the oppressive formation, the more subjectivism certifies the result as autonomous.\n\n3. Content-Based Accounts: The Lure and Limits of Substantive Independence\n\nSome philosophers, influenced by perfectionist liberals like Raz or capability theorists like Nussbaum, hold that autonomy includes an objective element. If a preference favors servility, genital cutting, or self-destruction, then\u2014whatever the agent thinks\u2014something has gone wrong. The content is inconsistent with self-authoring agency.\n\nThis view has four advantages:\n\n\u2022 It explains why autonomous agents care about certain goods (bodily integrity, practical reasoning, affiliation).\n\n\u2022 It nails the intuition that preferences endorsing subordination are defective.\n\n\u2022 It can criticize adaptive preferences even when the agent endorses them.\n\n\u2022 It dovetails with political projects aimed at expanding capabilities.\n\nYet it pays three prices.\n\nFirst, it risks conflating moral badness with autonomy deficit. Suppose Jan adapts to rationing by learning to love cabbage. Nothing morally objectionable about loving cabbage, but did Jan\u2019s preference formation involve the same autonomy loss as the happy slave\u2019s? A purely content-based test says no, so it cannot explain why we hesitate to treat her preference as fully hers when it originated in severe shortage.\n\nSecond, content tests court paternalism. To declare early marriage autonomy\u2010reducing because it is bad per se invites the charge that we are imposing external values and failing to respect cultural difference.\n\nThird, content focus misses an explanatory datum: what makes adaptive preferences suspect is not just their objects but the fact that they emerged through social mechanisms designed to limit perceived alternatives. Two agents could both endorse a life of domesticity; if one had a real range of live options and the other did not, our verdict should differ.\n\n4. Historical Accounts: Etiology, Bypassing, and Social Power\n\nHistorical or procedural theories claim that autonomy hinges on how the desire was produced. Robert Young, Ben Colburn, and Marina Oshana emphasize whether the desire was formed in a way that \u201cbypassed\u201d the agent\u2019s critical faculties or emerged through pressured socialization. Relational theorists (Mackenzie, Stoljar, Friedman) tie bypassing to power: oppressive norms get internalized precisely because agents are dependent on the very relationships that convey them.\n\nThe historical approach can explain all three earlier cases:\n\nHappy Slave: The preference is non-autonomous because systematic indoctrination bypassed the slave\u2019s critical reflection.\n\nInternalized Misogyny: The endorsement arose within a patriarchal culture that narrowed her horizon of possibility; alternative identities were socially disabled.\n\nContented Sweatshop Worker: Severe material coercion left acceptance of drudgery the only psychologically sustainable path; preference formation was reactive rather than deliberative.\n\nKey virtue: the account explains why wholehearted endorsement is not decisive and why innocuous-looking preferences may still be suspect if they trace to unjust constraints.\n\nKey challenge: All preferences have histories. Which features mark some as autonomy defeating? Here is where the notion of \u201crelational bypassing\u201d earns its keep.\n\n5. Relational Bypassing: A Diagnostic Criterion\n\nA preference is autonomy-defective when:\n\ni. Dependence: It is shaped in a context where the agent\u2019s access to valued goods (food, safety, recognition, love) depends on conforming to the preference.\n\nii. Constraint on Imagination: The social process restricts the agent\u2019s ability to entertain alternative conceptions of the good life, either by informational deprivation or by sanctioning deviation.\n\niii. Immunization: The process inoculates the preference against future critical scrutiny, for example by attaching shame to dissent or valorizing self-sacrifice.\n\nWhen (i)\u2013(iii) jointly obtain, the agent\u2019s critical faculties are not merely influenced (which is normal) but colonized. The resulting preference stabilizes the oppressive structure, feeding a loop in which domination reproduces itself via the very subjectivities it manufactures.\n\n6. Objections and Replies\n\nObjection A: \u201cMany ordinary preferences (e.g., national tastes in food, fashion, language) fit criteria (i)\u2013(iii). Does your account imply that most preferences are non-autonomous?\u201d\n\nReply: The question is degree, not all-or-nothing. A relational-historical view yields a scalar autonomy metric. Mild dependence plus porous imagination plus easy revisability constitutes a low deficit. Oppressive contexts crank up all three dimensions: dependence is existential, alternatives are absent or punished, and dissent is pathologized. Adaptive preferences under oppression cluster at the high-deficit end.\n\nObjection B: \u201cYour account still smuggles in substantive value: it presumes that domination and imagination- restriction are bad. Isn\u2019t this a covert perfectionism?\u201d\n\nReply: The account presupposes only thin normative premises: autonomy requires that agents exercise critical reflection under conditions of adequate information and some freedom from coercive dependence. These are procedural, not perfectionist, conditions. One need not judge the content of the eventual choice; one need only care that the path to that choice remained open.\n\nObjection C: \u201cSometimes adaptation is the best an agent can do; criticizing her preferences adds insult to injury.\u201d\n\nReply: A relational-historical analysis targets the social conditions that produced the deficit, not the agent. Saying that the preference is non-autonomous does not blame the agent; it diagnoses a form of injustice that burdens her with coping strategies. Recognizing the deficit motivates reform: expand the option set, protect dissent, supply counter-narratives.\n\n7. Why the Historical-Relational Account Outperforms Rivals\n\na. It isolates the autonomy dimension: by focusing on bypassing mechanisms, it avoids conflating autonomy with moral virtue or happiness.\n\nb. It accommodates benign adaptation: if adaptation occurs without systematic bypassing (injured mountaineer discovers birdwatching through reflective exploration), autonomy is preserved.\n\nc. It explains the political function of adaptive preferences: oppressive systems invest heavily in shaping subjectivity precisely because that secures stable compliance. The historical view makes sense of this fact; endorsement and content views do not.\n\nd. It fits empirical data: psychological studies show that preference change under scarcity is mediated by threat to agency and sense of control. Interventions that restore perceived control (e.g., providing information, social support) reverse adaptive downgrading. Thus procedural conditions, not mere content or endorsement, are causal levers.\n\n8. Two Illustrative Cases\n\nCase A: Early Marriage in Rural Rajasthan\n\nGirls aged 13\u201315 often express enthusiastic approval of early marriage, citing family honor and personal safety. Survey work reveals that many have never met an unmarried adult woman, schooling is logistically and culturally foreclosed, and dissent invites social ostracism. The endorsement is wholehearted; the content (marriage) is not prima facie evil. Still, autonomy is compromised because (i) dependence on family protection is total, (ii) alternative life plans are literally unimaginable, and (iii) honor norms immunize the preference from criticism (\u201ca good girl never questions marriage\u201d).\n\nCase B: Post-Incarceration Job Aspirations\n\nFormer prisoners frequently report preferring low-paying manual labor \u201cbecause it\u2019s honest work.\u201d Though honest work is unobjectionable, qualitative interviews show that the preference often arises after repeated rejections, discriminatory hiring, and parole requirements that threaten reincarceration if work is not secured quickly. The man adapts his career aspirations downward to avoid the psychic toll of futile striving. His preference is understandable, morally innocent, yet not fully autonomous in the sense that the labor market\u2019s constraints and surveillance coerce its formation.\n\nContent-based views must call Case B autonomous; endorsement views must call Case A autonomous. Historical-relational views diagnose both deficits and can say exactly why they differ in degree.\n\n9. Policy and Ethical Implications\n\nThe relational-historical diagnosis suggests interventions:\n\n\u2022 Expand capabilities: reduce dependence by providing material resources (micro-credit, social safety nets).\n\n\u2022 Multiply counter-narratives: ensure access to dissenting viewpoints (media pluralism, education).\n\n\u2022 Protect exit and voice: legal rights that make alternative life paths feasible.\n\nThe goal is not to induce agents to prefer some predetermined content but to reopen the procedural space in which preferences can form and reform.\n\n10. Conclusion\n\nAdaptive preferences appear less than fully autonomous because they are the sediment of unjust constraint. Subjectivist endorsement accounts mistake internalized domination for authenticity; content-based accounts rightly condemn many objects of adaptive desire but conflate autonomy with moral worth and overlook innocuous yet non-autonomous adaptation. A historical-relational approach, focusing on the etiological role of dependence, imagination constraint, and immunization, best captures what is missing: the agent\u2019s critical standpoint has been colonized.\n\nBecause autonomy is fundamentally a relational achievement, sustained only where social and material conditions leave room for genuine self-direction, oppressive contexts convert psychological resilience into a political obstacle by molding what agents can want. Recognizing this dynamic clarifies both the philosophical puzzle of adaptive preferences and the practical urgency of dismantling the structures that make them necessary.", "output_tokens": 3351, "reasoning_tokens": 448}

Introduction: the puzzle of wanting what confines us  \n\nA factory worker in a garment sweatshop insists she prefers the fourteen-hour shift because \u201cI am lucky to have any job at all.\u201d A wife in a rigidly patriarchal household says she prefers to eat only after her husband and sons are finished: \u201cIt is simply right that men be served first.\u201d A teenage girl raised in a refugee camp claims she does not want to continue her education: \u201cSchool is for people with opportunities; I should help Mother at home.\u201d  These are paradigmatic adaptive preferences\u2014attitudes that have adjusted to a narrow, often unjust, range of feasible options.  They raise a distinctive autonomy puzzle.  On the one hand, the agents sincerely affirm these preferences; on the other, something seems amiss in treating them as fully self-governing choices.  If autonomy is the ability to determine one\u2019s practical identity and life path, how can wanting the yoke of one\u2019s own oppression count as autonomous?\n\nThe philosophical literature offers three broad explanatory strategies.  Subjectivist or \u201cstructural\u201d accounts, exemplified by Frankfurt\u2019s hierarchical theory, look solely to the agent\u2019s own patterns of desire and endorsement.  Content-based or \u201csubstantive\u201d accounts evaluate the moral quality of what is preferred; some desires, because of what they aim at, are ipso facto autonomy-undermining.  Historical or relational accounts focus on the processes by which the preference was formed, asking whether it arose from manipulation, coercion, or systemic injustice.  \n\nI shall argue that:  \n\nThesis.  The autonomy deficit of oppressive adaptive preferences is best explained by a historical-relational account: such preferences are non-autonomous when (i) they result from socialization that structurally deprives the agent of epistemic and practical opportunities to question the constraints shaping them and (ii) the agent has not subsequently had a fair chance to re-evaluate them in conditions of expanded freedom.  Subjectivist endorsement is neither sufficient nor necessary for autonomy; content-based criteria risk paternalism and false negatives.  A historically relational test captures why, yet also when, an adaptive preference can eventually become genuinely one\u2019s own.  \n\nThe argument proceeds as follows.  Section 2 clarifies autonomy and the concept of adaptation.  Sections 3 and 4 critique subjectivist and content-based accounts, respectively, using concrete cases.  Section 5 develops the historical-relational alternative and shows how it resolves the puzzle while avoiding paternalistic overreach.  Section 6 replies to two important objections: the \u201crational accommodator\u201d objection and the \u201cinescapable history\u201d objection.  A brief conclusion draws policy implications for empowerment and social justice.\n\n2. Autonomy and adaptive preference: setting the conceptual stage  \n\n2.1 Autonomy: procedural, substantive, relational  \n\nAutonomy has long been parsed along three axes.  A procedurally autonomous choice issues from an internal psychological structure that is reflectively endorsed (Frankfurt, Dworkin).  A substantively autonomous choice must also meet certain content standards\u2014e.g., respect for one\u2019s own moral worth (Korsgaard, Nussbaum).  Finally, a relational account insists that autonomy is exercised within social power relations; distorted socialization and dependency can invalidate even procedurally sound, morally acceptable preferences (Oshana, Benson, Christman).\n\n2.2 Adaptive preferences  \n\nSen coined the term to explain why the oppressed often report high levels of life satisfaction.  But adaptation is not merely reporting happiness; it is a dynamic of preference formation: when an agent\u2019s feasible option set shrinks, preferences shift toward what remains available, thereby reducing cognitive dissonance between desire and possibility.  The result can be epistemically and emotionally protective, yet it risks locking an agent into an unjust status quo.  \n\nImportantly, not every adaptation is autonomy-defeating.  Preferring black coffee after learning you are lactose-intolerant seems perfectly benign.  What concerns us is adaptive preference under oppression\u2014where constraints stem from unjust power structures that the agent has no reasonable moral obligation to accept.\n\n3. The limits of subjectivist endorsement  \n\n3.1 Frankfurt\u2019s hierarchical model  \n\nFor Frankfurt, an agent is autonomous\u2014or, in his terminology, has \u201cfree will\u201d\u2014when her first-order desires are aligned with her higher-order volitions.  If I not only want to smoke but also want to want to smoke, my smoking is an expression of self-governance.  Applied to adaptive preferences, the subjectivist would say: as long as the sweatshop worker reflectively endorses her preference for fourteen-hour shifts, her choice is autonomous.\n\n3.2 Why endorsement is not enough  \n\na) Self-subordination can be wholehearted.  Empirical studies of internalized sexism and racism show that members of subordinated groups can\u2014and often do\u2014wholeheartedly endorse their own subordination.  The \u201chappy housewife\u201d of Betty Friedan\u2019s critique passes Frankfurt\u2019s hierarchical test, yet her preference is precisely what critics call adaptive and autonomy-compromised.  \n\nb) Endorsement can be engineered.  Suppose a totalitarian regime subjects citizens to pervasive propaganda until they sincerely endorse the regime\u2019s ideology.  Even if the citizens now wholeheartedly prefer their chains, we hesitate to call them autonomous, because their endorsement itself is the product of manipulation.\n\nc) Frankfurt\u2019s regress problem.  One might posit higher-order endorsements of the second-order volitions, but unless we eventually appeal to how those desires formed, the account becomes either viciously regressive or arbitrary.  A purely structural view cannot discriminate between free endorsement and endorsement produced by oppressive socialization.\n\n4. The ambitions\u2014and perils\u2014of content-based criteria  \n\n4.1 Substantive theories  \n\nNussbaum\u2019s capabilities approach proposes a list of basic functionings (nutrition, bodily integrity, practical reason, etc.).  A preference that rejects significant capability\u2014say, a girl who prefers not to be educated\u2014counts as \u201cincomplete\u201d or \u201ccorrupted.\u201d  Similarly, Raz claims that autonomy requires an adequate range of valuable options; if the content of one\u2019s choice undermines one\u2019s agency or well-being, autonomy is absent.\n\n4.2 The paternalism worry  \n\nContent criteria can flag the most repugnant adaptive preferences, but at the cost of overriding individuals whose life plans genuinely differ from dominant values.  Consider the Buddhist monk who freely embraces poverty and celibacy.  On a crude capability threshold (income, sexual expression) his preference looks disqualifying, yet few would deny the monk\u2019s autonomy.  Content-based accounts risk conflating disagreement with deficiency.\n\n4.3 False negatives and false positives  \n\nSome oppressive preferences bear morally unproblematic content.  A woman might adapt by preferring embroidery over soccer because sports facilities are male-only.  The content\u2014needlework\u2014is innocuous, yet the preference feels autonomy-deflated given its origin.  Conversely, a saboteur who sincerely prefers to undermine an unjust state pursues morally excellent ends; yet if her preference was instilled via cultish brainwashing, autonomy is missing.  Content alone cannot reliably track autonomy.\n\n5. A historical-relational explanation  \n\n5.1 Core idea  \n\nWhat undermines autonomy is not the structure of desires nor their moral valence but the history of their formation within oppressive constraints.  Autonomy requires that one\u2019s preferences be \u201cpractically available to critical reflection under conditions that were not themselves coercively limited or epistemically distorted by domination\u201d (paraphrasing Christman).  The question shifts from \u201cDo you endorse this?\u201d or \u201cIs this good for you?\u201d to \u201cDid you ever have a fair chance not to want this?\u201d\n\n5.2 Two historical conditions for autonomy  \n\nCondition A:  Non-domination at the formative stage.  The processes that shaped the preference must be free from coercion, manipulation, and severe epistemic deprivation.  This includes structural phenomena: gendered division of labor, racist stereotypes, economic dependency.  Direct coercion is not needed; pervasive socialization that systematically discredits alternative identities can suffice.\n\nCondition B:  Opportunity for critical reappraisal.  Even if a preference originates under oppression, it can become autonomous if the agent subsequently encounters new information, alternative life paths, and enjoys the social and psychological safety to scrutinize her commitments.  Autonomy is thus temporally open-ended; emancipation can retroactively validate a preference.\n\n5.3 The explanatory payoff  \n\na) Why wholehearted yet subservient preferences lack autonomy: they violate Condition A; endorsement itself is a product of domination.  \n\nb) Why monks can freely choose austerity: their preference, though restrictive in content, is typically formed in communities where entry is voluntary and critical exit is possible.  Condition A is met; so is Condition B, because novices are exposed to the outside world before taking vows.\n\nc) Why mundane adaptations (black coffee) remain autonomous: lactose intolerance is a natural, not oppressive, constraint; the history is not one of domination.\n\n5.4 Illustrative case: FGM acceptance  \n\nIn many communities, young women express pride in having undergone female genital cutting, describing it as a virtue and marriage prerequisite.  A subjectivist must (uncomfortably) deem their preference autonomous.  A content theorist deems it non-autonomous because it violates bodily integrity.  The historical-relational view explains both their endorsement and its defect.  The preference was inculcated through socialization that withholds credible information about the harms of FGM, stigmatizes \u201cuncut\u201d women, and threatens social death for dissenters\u2014violating Condition A.  Most have never encountered real opportunities or safety to reconsider\u2014violating Condition B.  The verdict of non-autonomy follows without appealing to moralistic paternalism.\n\n6. Replies to two objections  \n\n6.1 Objection 1: the rational accommodator  \n\nSometimes adapting is the most rational way to cope with immovable constraints.  The factory worker\u2019s preference for the fourteen-hour shift keeps her children fed.  Why deny her autonomy merely because she clears an unjustly low bar of opportunities?\n\nResponse.  The historical account does not conflate practical rationality with autonomy.  One can rationally navigate injustice yet suffer an autonomy deficit precisely because injustice constrained the space of deliberation from the start.  Not every constrained choice is non-autonomous; the critical point is whether the preference itself has become aligned with the constraint in a way the agent never had fair reason or opportunity to resist.  If the worker privately despises the hours but accepts them as a necessary evil, her preference is not adaptive; she remains lucidly critical, and her agency survives.  If, however, she has come to believe such long hours are inherently fitting for people \u201clike her,\u201d the constraint has colonized her self-conception.  It is this colonization, not the rational accommodation, that our criterion marks as autonomy-eroding.\n\n6.2 Objection 2: inescapable histories  \n\nIf every preference has some history, and all histories involve social influence, won\u2019t almost every preference fail Condition A?  Does the historical account demand impossible purity?\n\nResponse.  The criterion is not influence-free genesis but non-dominating influence.  Socialization is inevitable; domination is not.  Influence becomes autonomy-defeating when (i) it systematically aims to entrench agents\u2019 subordination and (ii) it forecloses their later ability to scrutinize and revise the induced preference.  Many ordinary cultural transmissions\u2014say, my love for local cuisine\u2014are influence-saturated yet non-dominating because they can be reconsidered without penalty and because alternatives are visible.  The standard is demanding only where justice demands it.\n\n7. Synthesis: a dynamic, relational autonomy metric  \n\nThe discussion suggests a three-step diagnostic for adaptive preferences in contexts of oppression:  \n\n1. Identify the constraining structure: Is the option set limited by unjust social power (patriarchal norms, racial caste, economic exploitation)?  \n\n2. Trace the formation process: Were the agent\u2019s epistemic resources and social support sufficiently robust to explore alternatives without fear or severe cost?  \n\n3. Check for critical moments: Has the agent since encountered, in a psychologically and materially safe environment, reasons and role models that could prompt re-evaluation?  \n\nOnly when the answer to 1 is \u201cyes\u201d and at least one of 2 or 3 is \u201cno\u201d do we have a prima facie autonomy deficit.  The view is compatible with respecting later wholehearted endorsements that survive open scrutiny, thereby limiting paternalistic intervention.\n\n8. Policy and moral implications  \n\nUnderstanding adaptive preferences through a historical-relational lens reframes practical debates.  It shifts the focus from overriding individuals\u2019 current choices to altering the background structures that warp preference formation.  Empowerment policies\u2014expanding education, guaranteeing exit options, protecting dissent, providing economic security\u2014are autonomy-enhancing not because they coerce better choices but because they widen the historical pathways through which genuine self-determination can emerge.  Development economists, for example, have begun using \u201cpreference revelation\u201d programs: providing young women with information about wages and safety in different occupations.  If, after exposure, they still prefer domestic service, that preference deserves respect; if many revise their aspirations, the prior endorsements were adaptive.\n\n9. Conclusion  \n\nWhy are adaptive preferences under oppression less than fully autonomous?  Because they bear the mark of histories in which power silenced curiosity, choked alternatives, and colonized self-conceptions.  Subjectivist endorsement can coexist with this colonization; content-based moralism can misidentify it.  A historical-relational account isolates the core deficiency\u2014the unjust genesis and insulation of the preference\u2014while preserving room for cultural pluralism and individual diversity.  Autonomy, on this view, is not a snapshot of internal harmony or moral correctness but a trajectory of preference formation within a social space of equals.  When that space is constricted by domination, adaptation masquerades as agency.  The task of philosophy\u2014and of politics\u2014is to tell the difference, and to help build the conditions under which masquerade is no longer a rational strategy but an unnecessary relic of a less just world.", "output_tokens": 3669, "reasoning_tokens": 704}

Setting the Problem  \n\nIn 1964 James Scott noticed that colonized peasants \u201clearn to want what they can get.\u201d Fifty years later the label \u201cadaptive preferences\u201d has become standard for this apparently perverse phenomenon: when circumstances are hard enough, people sometimes reshape their desires to fit the narrow range of goods they can realistically hope to secure. The vineyard-worker in Aesop who declares the unreachable grapes \u201csour,\u201d the woman in a conservative village who declares that higher education is \u201cunfeminine,\u201d the imprisoned \u201chappy slave\u201d who proclaims that bondage suits his nature\u2014all are canonical cases.\n\nWhy worry? Ordinary prudence often counsels adaptation; after an accident, preferring a wheelchair to a mountain bike can be fully rational. The political philosopher\u2019s specific worry is autonomy. Something feels amiss\u2014especially where preferences track oppressive constraints rather than brute facts of nature\u2014yet spelling out exactly what goes missing has proven surprisingly hard. Three large families of answers dominate the literature:\n\n\u2022 Subjectivist or endorsement accounts (e.g., Frankfurt, Dworkin, Bratman): a preference is autonomous just in case the agent reflectively identifies with it.\n\n\u2022 Content-based or substantive accounts (e.g., Nussbaum\u2019s capabilities approach, Raz\u2019s perfectionism): certain things are objectively bad to prefer, so preferring them is non-autonomous.\n\n\u2022 Historical or procedural accounts (e.g., Elster, Oshana, Benson, Khader): the pedigree of a preference matters; if it was shaped by illegitimate social forces, it is not fully one\u2019s own.\n\nI will defend the thesis that a suitably refined historical account best explains the autonomy deficit of adaptive preferences in oppressive contexts. Subjectivist endorsement is too weak because reflective identification itself can be sculpted by domination; content-based theories are too strong because they conflate autonomy with moral correctness. A historical view can avoid both pitfalls if it focuses on the freedom-undermining features of the formative process: coercion, deprivation of information, and systematically limited imaginative horizons. I conclude by proposing a hybrid \u201ccounterfactual-historical\u201d test that marks the right boundary between permissible prudential adaptation and autonomy-eroding resignation.\n\n2. What Autonomy Requires  \n\nAutonomy is a family resemblance concept, but most accounts share three elements:\n\na) Psychological ownership: an autonomous preference must be authentically mine.  \nb) Independence: it must be formed and sustained free from controlling influences.  \nc) Competence: I must possess the cognitive capacity to grasp relevant reasons.\n\nAdaptive preferences seem to threaten (a) and (b): they feel alien\u2014\u201cnot really what she would want if circumstances were different\u201d\u2014and they reflect external domination. The puzzle is to articulate these misgivings without making autonomy impossible for everyone lacking an ideal upbringing.\n\n3. The Subjectivist Strategy and Its Limits  \n\nHarry Frankfurt\u2019s hierarchical model is the locus classicus. A desire is autonomous when the agent endorses it from a higher-order perspective: she wants to want it. If Aisha endorses her preference to undergo female genital cutting, then, on Frankfurt\u2019s view, that preference is authentically hers.\n\n3.1 The Happy Endorsement Problem  \nOppression can penetrate the second-order layer itself. Members of subordinated groups are often socialized to endorse exactly those first-order desires that keep them compliant. Empirical psychology names the mechanism \u201cnormative internalization.\u201d The phenomenon is precisely what we mean by \u201cadaptive.\u201d So the Frankfurtian test risks calling the most troubling cases fully autonomous.\n\n3.2 Epistemic Distortion  \nOne might reply that Frankfurtian endorsement must be informed and reflectively stable. Yet the required epistemic conditions silently smuggle in historical considerations: Why is her information limited? Why has her horizon of imaginative alternatives narrowed? Once we ask those questions, we have already left the purely subjectivist domain and entered a historical one.\n\n3.3 The Regress Problem  \nIf oppressive conditions can shape first-order and second-order desires, then a regress looms: do we now need a third-order endorsement, and so on ad infinitum? Frankfurt avoided the regress by stipulating that identification bottoms out in wholeheartedness, but wholeheartedness can itself be manufactured by domination. The subjectivist lacks a principled way to stop the slide.\n\nIn short, endorsement is a necessary condition for autonomy\u2014without it the agent is alienated from her preferences\u2014but not sufficient in contexts of systematic power imbalance.\n\n4. Content-Based Theories: Moralism in Disguise?  \n\nMartha Nussbaum has argued that some preferences are \u201cbeyond the pale\u201d because they violate objective conditions of human flourishing (bodily integrity, practical reason, affiliation, etc.). If a woman prefers beatings to freedom of movement, we can simply declare the preference non-autonomous because its content contradicts human dignity.\n\n4.1 The Paternalism Objection  \nThe substantive strategy risks collapsing autonomy into moral rightness. Suppose a devout monk autonomously chooses celibacy. Many liberals think celibacy is a legitimate life plan even though it sacrifices one of Nussbaum\u2019s capabilities (sexual satisfaction). More dramatically, some people autonomously choose hazardous sports, extreme fasting, or vow poverty. Content-based theories over-inclusive: they mark these choices as deficient when no oppression is in sight.\n\n4.2 Adaptive vs. Ill-Chosen  \nTo capture the distinctive wrongness of adaptive preferences, we need to differentiate between autonomy and prudence. Climbing Everest might be foolish, but if the choice is made under conditions of information and expressive freedom, it is quintessentially autonomous. Content-based theories fail to honor that distinction.\n\n4.3 The Missing Mechanism  \nFinally, content-based accounts do not explain how oppression produces the problematic preferences. They merely say \u201cthe preference is bad\u201d; they do not illuminate why it is not quite the agent\u2019s own.\n\nTherefore, while moral quality matters for policy\u2014states are justified in discouraging genital cutting even if chosen\u2014it does not by itself identify the autonomy deficit.\n\n5. Historical Accounts: The Promising Middle Path  \n\nHistorical theorists claim that autonomy depends on how, not merely on what, we prefer. A preference is non-autonomous if it bears the wrong causal pedigree\u2014if it was produced by manipulation, coercion, or deprivation. This orientation directly targets the phenomenon of adaptation to constraint.\n\n5.1 The Causal Story of Oppression  \nOppression typically narrows option sets (material constraint), restricts information flow (epistemic constraint), and penalizes deviance (social sanction). Over time, individuals left with few live possibilities begin to prefer the feasible. That adaptive mechanism is perfectly rational as survival strategy, but its rationality is derivative\u2014it flows from coercive social facts. The historical account highlights precisely those facts, explaining why the resulting preferences feel externally imposed.\n\n5.2 Counterfactual Dependence  \nAn intuitive test is the \u201cfree-world counterfactual\u201d: Would the agent still prefer X if she had grown up with adequate resources, information, and respect? If likely not, the preference is historically tainted. This is Elster\u2019s famous \u201cflower in an oxygen-poor environment\u201d analogy: the bloom is stunted not because it now wants to be small but because the soil was robbed of nutrients.\n\n5.3 From History to Norms  \nSkeptics worry that causal etiology alone cannot yield a normative verdict; after all, every preference has a cause. The reply is to specify regulating norms of formation:  \n(a) Non-coercion: preferences induced by threats lack autonomy.  \n(b) Adequate information: formation under ignorance or false belief undermines ownership.  \n(c) Social imagination: the agent must have enjoyed real opportunities to sample or vividly envision alternatives.  \nThese are process-based, not content-based, constraints. They do the normative work without moralizing the outcome.\n\n5.4 Prudential vs. Oppressive Adaptation  \nHistorical criteria also separate legitimate adaptation (to disability, aging, personal temperament) from adaptive resignation. When a climber who lost her legs learns to love wheelchair tennis, no oppressive force prevented her from keeping up-to-date information, imaginative exploration, and social respect. By contrast, when a caste-bound Dalit \u201cchooses\u201d not to apply to university because \u201cpeople like me don\u2019t belong there,\u201d all three historical criteria are violated.\n\n6. Objections to the Historical Account  \n\n6.1 Verification Worries  \nHow can we know the causal history of another\u2019s desire? Autonomy is a practical concept; if assessment required detective-level knowledge of childhood socialization, it would be useless. Two replies: (i) many oppressive contexts leave public, structural traces\u2014severe option deprivation, education gaps, sanctions\u2014so inference is often possible; (ii) the aim is not courtroom certainty but moral guidance about when intervention is justified. Probabilistic evidence often suffices.\n\n6.2 The Filtering Problem  \nEveryone\u2019s preferences are causally influenced by culture. If the historical test is too demanding, no one is fully autonomous. The solution is to calibrate the criteria to domination, not mere influence. Influence per se is inescapable and often autonomy-enhancing (learning a language). What defeats autonomy is influence that systematically disables critical reflection or viable exit. The distinction tracks interpersonal power, not mere social shaping.\n\n6.3 Respecting Present-Time Agency  \nDoes labeling someone\u2019s preference \u201cnon-autonomous\u201d insult her agency? Two thoughts. First, autonomy is scalar; calling a preference historically tainted does not strip the person of all agency. Second, critique aims at structural reform, not personal condemnation. Blaming the victim for her preference would indeed be disrespectful, but diagnosing oppressive formation is a way of directing responsibility upward, toward institutions that manufactured her limited horizon.\n\n7. A Hybrid Proposal: Counterfactual Historical Endorsement  \n\nWe can now articulate a refined account in three clauses:\n\n(i) Reflective Identification: The agent endorses the preference at time t. (Subjectivist element.)\n\n(ii) Procedural Pedigree: The preference was not formed or sustained by coercion, information deprivation, or imaginative foreclosure. (Historical element.)\n\n(iii) Robust Counterfactual Endurance: In a plausible nearby world where those procedural defects are absent, the agent would still endorse the preference after critical reflection. (Bridges historical and subjectivist conditions.)\n\nClause (iii) handles the remaining worry that people can presently reflect yet still be unable to envisage alternatives. It also captures the slogan \u201cautonomy is choosing under conditions of freedom even if those conditions are hypothetical.\u201d Notice that content plays no direct role; nothing prevents an agent, after liberated reflection, from endorsing celibacy or even risk-laden adventure. Yet the account condemns the caste-based resignation because the preference would predictably dissolve once the oppressive background is lifted.\n\n8. Policy Implications  \n\nWhy does the theoretical account matter? Consider three practical arenas:\n\n1. Development Economics. Should aid agencies override local women\u2019s stated preferences for large families? The hybrid view implies caution: investigate whether the preference survives exposure to alternative life plans, schooling, and reduced child mortality. If it does, respect it; if not, design empowerment programs that widen horizons before ascribing \u201ctrue\u201d preference.\n\n2. Legal Regulation of Bodily Harm. Should a state criminalize female genital cutting even when adult women request it? The historical account says YES when the requesting environment systematically withholds information about sexual function or penalizes dissent, and MAYBE NOT in the rare diasporic case where informed, uncoerced adults with genuine exit options freely choose the practice.\n\n3. Workplace Choices under Neoliberalism. Gig-economy workers often declare they \u201clove flexibility.\u201d Are these adaptive? We must ask: Are alternative forms of secure employment realistically available? Is information about long-term income volatility transparent? If not, their professed \u201clove\u201d may signal historical taint, justifying labor protections.\n\n9. Comparative Merits Recap  \n\nSubjectivist endorsement Secures psychological ownership but ignores structurally induced endorsements.  \nContent-based moralism Flags some oppression, but at the cost of paternalism and autonomy/morality conflation.  \nHistorical proceduralism Explains oppression\u2019s distinctive damage, avoids over-inclusiveness, and preserves room for plural life plans.  \n\nTherefore, as advertised, the historical family, fortified with a counterfactual endorsement clause, best captures why adaptive preferences are less than fully autonomous.\n\n10. Conclusion  \n\nAdaptive preferences dramatize a tension at the heart of liberal philosophy: respect for self-determination versus the reality that social power shapes the very selves who determine. A purely internal (subjectivist) answer underestimates domination\u2019s reach; a purely external (content-based) answer overestimates the authority of philosophers to dictate the good life. By attending to history\u2014how preferences come to be\u2014and asking whether agents could own them under conditions of freedom, we strike the balance that autonomy theory requires. The result is both normatively sensitive to injustice and protective of the dizzying plurality of human aspirations that genuine autonomy allows.", "output_tokens": 3225, "reasoning_tokens": 512}

Setting the Problem  \n\nAgents often come to want exactly what they can get. A woman in a patriarchal village declares that she positively wants an arranged early marriage; a child soldier professes loyalty to his militia; a chronically under-employed worker claims to \u201clove the simple life.\u201d  Such wishes are adaptive: they arise in response to tight, often unjust, constraints on the agent\u2019s feasible set.  Intuitively these preferences are \u201cless than fully autonomous.\u201d  Yet the standard philosophical theories of autonomy give different diagnoses of what, exactly, is missing.  Subjectivist accounts ground autonomy in wholehearted endorsement of one\u2019s desires (Frankfurt, Hierarchy of Desires).  Content-based accounts locate autonomy in what is chosen rather than in who does the choosing, judging some preferences heteronomous because they aim at morally defective goods.  Historical or procedural accounts trace autonomy to the etiology of a preference\u2014whether it was arrived at through the exercise of the agent\u2019s own capacities, or implanted by forces that bypass those capacities.\n\nMy thesis is threefold:  \n\n(a) Adaptive preference per se is not an autonomy defect.  The deficit arises only when the adaptation occurs through procedures that bypass, disable, or distort the agent\u2019s evaluative capacities.  \n\n(b) Subjectivist and content-based accounts, taken on their own, systematically misclassify key cases because they abstract, respectively, from history and from agency.  \n\n(c) A historically informed, procedural\u2010relational account best captures why the preferences that form under oppression fail to be fully one\u2019s own.  The historical dimension explains both how oppression works\u2014by shaping options and molding desires\u2014and why merely satisfying the resulting preferences does not respect persons.\n\n\n2. Clarifying Concepts  \n\n2.1 Adaptive Preference.  A preference is adaptive when (i) the agent\u2019s feasible set is narrowed by externally imposed constraints, and (ii) her preference ranking adjusts in ways that make the constrained options appear positively desirable.  The adjustment can be conscious rationalization (\u201csour grapes\u201d) or non-conscious habituation (\u201clearning to desire what one repeatedly does\u201d).  \n\n2.2 Autonomy.  I treat autonomy as self-rule in the practical sphere: an action or preference is autonomous when it is the product of the agent\u2019s own reflectively endorsed evaluative standpoint, formed and revised through unimpaired exercises of her rational and affective capacities, free from illegitimate control by others.  This \u201cprocedural agency\u201d view deliberately separates autonomy from moral rightness; morally vicious yet self-chosen ends are, in principle, possible.\n\n2.3 Oppression.  I reserve the term for social structures that systematically limit an identifiable group\u2019s options and shape their self-conceptions in ways that stabilize the limitation.  Oppression therefore operates both externally (via coercion, material deprivation) and internally (via ideology, socialization).\n\n\n3. Three Diagnoses of the Deficit  \n\n3.1 Subjectivist (Hierarchical) Accounts  \n\nFrankfurt\u2019s model distinguishes first-order desires (D) from second-order volitions (D*).  An agent acts autonomously when she acts on D while wholeheartedly endorsing D with D*.  Applied to adaptive preference, the model assays autonomy by asking: Does the oppressed woman reflectively endorse her desire for early marriage?  If she does, Frankfurt must count her preference as autonomous.  \n\nProblem 1 \u2013  The Implanted Endorsement.  Oppressive socialization can generate second-order endorsements themselves\u2014internalized without critical scrutiny.  The model lacks resources to say why such \u201cadjusted\u201d endorsement is defective.  \n\nProblem 2 \u2013  Counterfactual Ignorance.  Endorsement is measured against the agent\u2019s actual psychological repertoire, not against what she could have endorsed in a less restrictive environment.  The account is thus blind to the device of limiting possibilities first, then eliciting wholehearted approval of what remains.\n\nTherefore, Frankfurtian endorsement is insufficient: it does not track the etiology of the preference and so misclassifies many adaptive cases as autonomous.\n\n3.2 Content-Based Accounts  \n\nContent theorists argue that certain preferences (e.g., to be enslaved, to self-mutilate) are autonomy-undermining because their objects are inherently inimical to agency or personhood.  Hence a woman\u2019s preference for genital cutting or permanent subordination is non-autonomous regardless of how she arrived at it.  \n\nStrength \u2013  Captures the intuition that some preferences are \u201cfalse\u201d to any person\u2019s good.  \n\nWeakness 1 \u2013  Over-inclusive.  A martyr\u2019s preference to endure torture for her faith is also self-harmful, yet plausibly autonomous.  \n\nWeakness 2 \u2013  Under-inclusive.  Suppose a village woman adapts by taking genuine delight in sewing rather than going to school.  The activity is innocuous in content, yet her preference still seems suspect if it is the result of gendered constraint.  Content theory cannot explain what is wrong.  \n\nWeakness 3 \u2013  Paternalistic Slippage.  By coding certain ends as inherently autonomy-incompatible, the account risks substituting the theorist\u2019s conception of the good for the agent\u2019s, ignoring pluralism.\n\nThus, while content matters ethically, it is a blunt instrument for diagnosing autonomy deficits intrinsic to adaptive preference.\n\n3.3 Historical (Procedural) Accounts  \n\nOn these views an attitude is autonomous if the process that produced it respected the agent\u2019s capacities for critical reflection.  Christman\u2019s \u201cbypassing\u201d condition: a preference is non-autonomous if it was caused in a way that bypassed the agent\u2019s capacities for self-reflection, such as hypnosis or coercive brainwashing.  Mele adds the \u201cmanipulation\u201d constraint: if the causal chain involved deceptive or coercive socialization that the agent could not resist, autonomy is undermined.\n\nAdaptive preference under oppression typically involves a long, subtle history: institutional deprivation curtails information; social norms punish dissent; credible alternatives are rendered invisible.  The formation pathway thereby bypasses robust exercises of reflection\u2014though not through momentary coercion but through a standing social ecology that steers evaluative development.  The historical view, especially in its relational extensions (Mackenzie, Oshana), seems tailor-made for these cases.\n\nPotential Worry \u2013  Etiological Perfectionism.  Must every preference trace back to perfectly undistorted formative influences to count as autonomous?  That bar is implausibly high; all socialization shapes us.  The historical theorist needs a principled threshold distinguishing legitimate from autonomy-undermining influence.\n\nI shall argue that a modification\u2014focusing on \u201csystematic, status-undermining bypassing\u201d\u2014solves this worry and gives the best account of the adaptive preference deficit.\n\n\n4. Testing the Theories: Three Cases  \n\nCase A: Prisoner\u2019s Garden.  A political prisoner in solitary for ten years comes to cherish his cramped prison garden as the highest good.  Upon release he has the option to cultivate vast public gardens but prefers the familiar small plot.  \n\n\u2022  Subjectivist verdict: autonomous (wholehearted).  \n\u2022  Content verdict: benign content \u21d2 autonomous.  \n\u2022  Historical verdict: suspect, since preference formed under severe constraint\u2014but note, constraint was not imposed with the aim of shaping gardening preferences.  Intuitively, the preference seems largely innocuous, perhaps even self-nurturing.  \n\nLesson: adaptive preference is not automatically non-autonomous; only certain kinds of constraint matter.\n\nCase B: Early Marriage Norm.  Girls in a rural region internalize the belief that marrying at 14 is honorable and that continued schooling is shameful.  They eagerly seek marriage proposals.  The practice is enforced by economic dependency, threat of social ostracism, and moralistic indoctrination.  \n\n\u2022  Subjectivist: wholehearted endorsement \u21d2 autonomy (bad result).  \n\u2022  Content: arguably non-autonomous because the end (lifelong subordination) is incompatible with flourishing\u2014yet we earlier saw martyrdom counterexample.  \n\u2022  Historical: preference produced by a social system that systematically forestalls awareness of alternatives, punishes dissent, and positions the girls as subordinate.  Their reflective faculties are sculpted to endorse the very regime that constrains them.  Autonomy deficit explained.\n\nCase C: Minimalist Worker.  An under-employed gig worker embraces \u201cvoluntary simplicity,\u201d declaring that consumer culture is hollow.  He is aware of higher-paying jobs but also of exploitative labor conditions.  He chooses minimalism partly in protest, partly to avoid burnout.  \n\nOur intuitions hover: perhaps his preference is autonomous despite being shaped by economic precarity.  The historical perspective can accommodate the mixed verdict: the worker\u2019s preference arises through critical evaluation of constraints rather than their uncritical internalization; hence it may clear the autonomy threshold.\n\nThe comparative test suggests that a qualified historical account tracks our nuanced judgments better than its rivals.\n\n\n5. Why Subjectivist and Content Accounts Fail Systematically  \n\n5.1 The \u201cTrajectory\u201d Blind Spot  \n\nSubjectivism mistakes present-tense endorsement as sufficient because it collapses autonomy into synchronic endorsement.  But adaptive preference shows that autonomy is a diachronic achievement: what matters is how the preference came to be.  The hierarchical model\u2019s failure to see that second-order volitions themselves can be products of oppressive filtering leaves it helpless against deep socialization.\n\n5.2 The \u201cSubstantive Goods\u201d Overreach  \n\nContent theory confuses autonomy with well-being.  While it is true that deeply self-destructive ends can signal autonomy failure, the correlation is imperfect.  Some autonomy-robust agents choose harmful ends (Kant\u2019s misanthrope who commits suicide from principle), while some adaptive preferences target benign goods but remain heteronomous because they are acceptances of unjust constraint rather than exercises of self-rule.\n\nThus both theories misfire for principled reasons.\n\n\n6. Refining the Historical Account: Bypassing plus Status Considerations  \n\nMerely adding history is not enough; we must say which historical features matter.  I propose:\n\nA preference P of agent S is non-autonomous if and only if  \n(i) P was formed through a process that systematically bypassed S\u2019s critical capacities, where  \n(ii) the bypassing occurred in virtue of S\u2019s social status (gender, caste, race, etc.) in a structure aimed at securing compliance, and  \n(iii) S lacks reasonable opportunities\u2014temporally extended, materially supported, risk-manageable\u2014to revisit or repudiate P.\n\nCondition (i) captures the procedural concern.  \nCondition (ii) embeds it in a relational context: it is not accidental tutelage but status-based domination that corrodes autonomy.  \nCondition (iii) prevents etiological perfectionism: a once-bypassed preference can regain autonomy if the agent later has\u2014and uses\u2014adequate space for critical uptake.\n\nThis three-part test explains our earlier cases.  The prisoner, once free, has ample opportunity to reflect and revise; if he persists in loving his small garden, the preference becomes his own.  The village girls lack such opportunities; social costs of revision are prohibitive.  The gig worker has partial opportunities, hence a mixed verdict.\n\nImportantly, the test avoids paternalism: intervention is justified not because the preference\u2019s content offends our sensibilities but because the agent is denied fair conditions for self-rule.\n\n\n7. Objections and Replies  \n\nObjection 1: Infinite Regress of Social Influence.  All preferences result from socialization; your view makes autonomy impossible.  \n\nReply: Social influence per se is not bypassing.  Bypassing is influence that disables or forecloses the very capacities through which agents normally filter influence.  Ordinary conversational persuasion engages these capacities; coercive indoctrination, psychological terror, or deprivation that prevents consideration of alternatives bypasses them.  The autonomy threshold is therefore demanding yet attainable.\n\nObjection 2: Epistemic Uncertainty.  How can an external assessor know the preference\u2019s history without intrusive speculation?  \n\nReply: In policy contexts we rarely need a metaphysical verdict of non-autonomy; what we need are defeasible indicators: severe, status-based constraint on options; evidence of punitive enforcement; lack of credible information channels.  These proxies track the likelihood of bypassing closely enough for legal and moral decision-making (e.g., in asylum or medical consent cases).\n\nObjection 3: Respect for Agency.  Declaring adaptive preferences non-autonomous risks disrespecting agents who genuinely value their culture\u2019s practices.  \n\nReply: The historical account embeds a procedural respect test: if the agent can and does critically affirm the practice under conditions allowing dissent without sanction, her choice stands\u2014even if outsiders deplore it.  Only when opportunity for critical engagement is structurally denied do we classify the preference as heteronomous.\n\nObjection 4:  Feminist Critique\u2014Relational Autonomy Already Contains This Story.  \n\nReply: I agree; my proposal foregrounds the historical mechanism that relational theories emphasize.  What I add is a sharper \u201cbypass plus status\u201d criterion that specifies exactly how oppressive relations undermine autonomy, thereby operationalizing relational autonomy for normative assessment.\n\n\n8. Normative Implications  \n\n8.1 Policy.  Development agencies should not aim at eradicating adaptive preferences directly (which risks cultural imperialism), but at dismantling the formative constraints: broadening education, offering material alternatives, protecting dissent.  Once conditions for critical reflection exist, agents can own or reject their traditional preferences autonomously.\n\n8.2 Consent Doctrine.  In medical ethics, consent procured from members of oppressed groups regarding culturally sanctioned harmful practices (e.g., FGM) should be scrutinized procedurally: Was the endorsement insulated from threats of ostracism?  Were genuine alternatives presented?\n\n8.3 Positive Freedom.  The account supports a robust, agency-enhancing notion of freedom: political liberation requires not only removing coercion but also furnishing the social conditions under which preferences can form autonomously.\n\n\n9. Concluding Synthesis  \n\nAdaptive preferences dramatize a tension in liberal thought: if we honor subjective endorsement alone, we risk ratifying oppression; if we impose objective goods, we risk paternalism.  The solution lies in history: preferences stamped into persons by social mechanisms that trade on their subordinate status, that foreclose genuine critical uptake, are not fully their own.  By contrast, preferences that survive after constraints are lifted\u2014indeed, preferences that emerge through the critical contest of reasons\u2014warrant respect, whatever their content.\n\nThe historically grounded procedural view outperforms the subjectivist and content-based alternatives because it\n\n\u2022 accounts for why wholehearted yet oppressed agents still lack self-rule (diagnosis),  \n\u2022 preserves room for cultural pluralism once oppressive constraints are removed (respect), and  \n\u2022 guides reform by targeting the social pathways of preference formation (action).\n\nTherefore, what makes an adaptive preference less than fully autonomous is neither its current endorsement nor its substantive object, but rather the tainted genealogy through which oppressive structures infiltrate and truncate the agent\u2019s capacity to shape her own will.  Autonomy demands a history worthy of a self-governing person; where that history is missing, liberation must begin.", "output_tokens": 3516, "reasoning_tokens": 320}

Introduction: what is at stake\n\nWhen we utter a sentence of the form \u2018A finds \u03c6 Adj\u2019\u2014for example, \u2018Holmes finds Saltimbocca tasty\u2019 or \u2018She finds lying wrong\u2019\u2014we are attributing to the subject A a certain mental state toward the object \u03c6.  Contemporary expressivists about value and taste suggest that that state is not a neutral representation of how things are in the world, but rather an affect-laden stance akin to liking, detesting, approving, or blaming.  If that diagnosis is correct, the semantics of the \u2018find\u2019-construction provides an unusually direct linguistic window on the kind of attitude evaluative discourse expresses.  The question, then, is what evidence there is\u2014linguistic, behavioural, inferential, phenomenological\u2014that the relevant \u2018find\u2019 state is indeed non-cognitive and specifically affective.\n\nMy thesis is that a convergent battery of diagnostics supports exactly that conclusion.  The \u2018evaluative find\u2019 (henceforth findE) behaves in syntax and discourse like a mental attitude of liking, enjoyment, or valuing, not like a belief or piece of knowledge.  At least six kinds of evidence point the same way:\n\n1. Selectional restrictions: findE can embed only predicates that already display canonical marks of subjectivity; descriptive adjectives and nouns are systematically excluded.\n\n2. Challenge patterns: findE assertions resist evidential, truth-conditional and calibration challenges appropriate for beliefs, but invite challenges that target emotional sensibility and taste.\n\n3. Inference profile: findE is non-factive and does not license the inferential bridge from \u2018S finds \u03c6 Adj\u2019 to \u2018Adj(\u03c6)\u2019.  Nor does it embed under \u2018believe\u2019 or \u2018know\u2019 in the way cognitive states do.\n\n4. Adverbial and intensifier compatibility: the adverbs that comfortably modify findE are paradigmatically affective (\u2018deeply\u2019, \u2018personally\u2019, \u2018utterly\u2019) whereas evidential or veracity adverbs (\u2018factually\u2019, \u2018verifiably\u2019, \u2018objectively\u2019) clash.\n\n5. Temporal-volitional behaviour: findE patterns with desire-like states that can shift, persist, or be cultivated, and it is the target of characteristic volitional constructions (\u2018I wish I still found olives delicious\u2019; \u2018Try to find the exercise fun\u2019).\n\n6. Moorean infelicity: first-person findE displays the same \u2018pragmatic self-defeat\u2019 phenomena that classically motivate non-cognitivism; denying one\u2019s own findE state while asserting the corresponding value claim yields palpable oddness.\n\nAfter laying out these six strands (\u00a72-\u00a77), I turn (\u00a78) to alternative cognitive accounts that treat findE as ascribing belief about a \u2018response-dependent\u2019 property (e.g., tastiness-for-A) and argue that they cannot accommodate the full set of data without special pleading.  I conclude (\u00a79) by sketching why the best explanation of the entire pattern is that findE attributes an affective, non-representational stance belonging to the same natural kind as loving, detesting, admiring, and loathing.\n\n2. Selectional restrictions\n\nPerhaps the cleanest surface clue is distributional: findE selects complements that are themselves semantically marked for subjectivity.  The contrast is familiar:\n\n(1a)   Holmes finds Saltimbocca tasty / delicious / delightful / revolting.  \n(1b) *Holmes finds Saltimbocca vegetarian / made-of-veal / served-at-room-temperature.\n\n(2a)   She finds lying wrong / cruel / reprehensible / admirable.  \n(2b) *She finds lying widespread / illegal-in-Norway / rare-in-monkeys.\n\nWhere selection is graded, the pattern aligns perfectly with scale of subjectivity.  \u2018Light\u2019 adjectives like \u2018salty\u2019, \u2018sweet\u2019, \u2018boring\u2019, which straddle evaluative and descriptive uses, are acceptable precisely on the evaluative reading; their purely sensory-descriptive reads are disallowed: \u2018Holmes finds the broth salty\u2019 is felicitous only if \u2018salty\u2019 conveys a hedonic reaction (\u2018too salty for his taste\u2019), not if it merely records NaCl level.\n\nSuch selectional behaviour is unprecedented among garden-variety cognitive attitude verbs (\u2018believe\u2019, \u2018think\u2019, \u2018suppose\u2019, \u2018guess\u2019), which embed any truth-conditional content.  The restriction is instead the mark of verbs whose complement denotes a psychological experience rather than a proposition: \u2018consider-ADJ\u2019, \u2018experience-as-ADJ\u2019, \u2018regard-as-ADJ\u2019, \u2018judge-ADJ\u2019, etc.  In Kratzer\u2019s semantics, these verbs combine with a predicate of individuals and return a property of experiencers; no proposition is ever formed.  That compositional fact makes it near-impossible to treat findE as encoding a belief relation to a truth-evaluable proposition.\n\n3. Challenge patterns\n\nConsider the canonical \u2018belief\u2019 challenges:\n\nCognitive challenge 1:  \u2018Is that really true?\u2019  \nCognitive challenge 2:  \u2018What evidence do you have?\u2019  \nCognitive challenge 3:  \u2018Are you sure, or could you be mistaken?\u2019\n\nNow contrast two dialogues:\n\nBelief case  \nA:  \u2018Pluto is no longer a planet.\u2019  \nB:  \u2018Really?  What evidence do you have?\u2019\n\nFindE case  \nA:  \u2018I find durian disgusting.\u2019  \nB: ??\u2018Really?  What evidence do you have?\u2019  \nBetter: \u2018Really?  Have you actually tried ripe durian?\u2019  \n         \u2018Oh come on, keep an open mind\u2014lots of people love it.\u2019\n\nChallenges to findE characteristically target the speaker\u2019s palate, experience, or openness, not epistemic credentials.  The discourse presupposes that the correct \u2018cure\u2019 for an erroneous findE is taste-acquisition or affect-modulation, never additional information.\n\nFurther, disagreement about findE complements takes the \u2018faultless\u2019 form familiar from predicates of personal taste:\n\nA:  \u2018Durian is delicious!\u2019  \nB:  \u2018No, it\u2019s disgusting.\u2019  \nBoth parties can withdraw with \u2018Well, I guess we just have different tastes\u2019\u2014an option hardly available when the bone of contention is the number of moons of Jupiter.  The faultless-disagreement phenomenon is widely taken to diagnose subjective attitude content.\n\n4. Inference profile\n\na) No factive bridge  \nFrom \u2018S finds \u03c6 Adj\u2019 one cannot validly infer \u2018Adj(\u03c6).\u2019  Compare:\n\n   \u2018Moriarty discovered that the vault was empty; therefore, the vault was empty.\u2019 (Valid, factive)  \n   \u2018Moriarty realised that the code was broken; therefore, \u2026\u2019 (Valid, factive)  \n\u2234  \u2018Moriarty found the wine tasty; therefore, the wine was tasty.\u2019 (Invalid)\n\nb) Embedding under \u2018believe/know\u2019  \n\u2018Holmes believes that the wine is tasty\u2019 is grammatical only on a reading where \u2018believes\u2019 semantically scopes over an ordinary propositional complement \u2018the wine is tasty.\u2019  It cannot embed the findE attitude: \u2018Holmes believes that he finds the wine tasty\u2019 is acceptable but changes the subject matter; the findE itself remains outside the complement.  Cognitive verbs, by contrast, embed each other freely.\n\nc) Failure of neg-raising  \nWith believe-like verbs, English displays neg-raising: \u2018I don\u2019t think P\u2019 implicates \u2018I think not-P.\u2019  FindE does not participate:\n\n   \u2018I don\u2019t find the movie funny\u2019  \u219b  \u2018I find the movie unfunny.\u2019  \nInstead, it conveys absence of the affect.\n\nd) Evidential modifiers  \n\u2018I allegedly find this book boring\u2019 is bizarre, while \u2018I allegedly think the book boring\u2019 is fine.  That is, one may question the source of a belief, but hardly the source of a taste reaction\u2014a further sign that what is at stake is an occurrent experiential state, not a stored doxastic attitude.\n\n5. Adverbial and intensifier compatibility\n\nCognitive attitudes happily combine with epistemic adverbs: \u2018honestly\u2019, \u2018truthfully\u2019, \u2018probably.\u2019  FindE favours intensifiers of valence and depth:\n\n   \u2018I personally / deeply / viscerally / instinctively find foie-gras cruel.\u2019  \n   *\u2018I verifiably / conclusively / statistically find foie-gras cruel.\u2019\n\nNotice also the availability of perspective shifts:\n\n   \u2018When I was twelve I found liquorice revolting, but now I find it delicious.\u2019\n\nBeliefs do shift, but their shift is normally data-driven, not developmental in the affective sense evoked here.  The naturalness of these developmental modifiers again displays affinity with liking and hating.\n\n6. Temporal-volitional behaviour\n\nBecause findE reports a feeling, it interacts with time and volition like other affective states:\n\n   Future orientation: \u2018You\u2019ll find the second movement breathtaking once you\u2019ve heard it live.\u2019  \n   Volitional:      \u2018Try to find the exercise fun\u2014put on some music.\u2019  \n   Sustaining:      \u2018I still find the sunset awe-inspiring.\u2019\n\nAnalogous constructions with must-belief verbs are pragmatically deviant:\n\n   \u2018Try to believe that G\u00f6del\u2019s theorem is true.\u2019 (possible but requires hypnotic or religious context)  \n   \u2018You\u2019ll believe the theorem once you meet the lecturer.\u2019 (odd unless brainwashing is implied)\n\nVolition over belief is anomic; volition over affect is quotidian.\n\n7. Moorean infelicity\n\nThe hallmark of assertoric inconsistency for belief is Moore\u2019s paradox:\n\n   (MP)  *\u2018It\u2019s raining, but I don\u2019t believe that it\u2019s raining.\u2019\n\nUttering MP is pragmatically self-defeating since assertion both expresses belief and denies it.  Now notice the parallel for findE:\n\n   (FP)  *\u2018Eating meat is wrong, but I don\u2019t find it wrong.\u2019  \n   (FP\u02b9) *\u2018This stew is delicious, but I don\u2019t find it delicious.\u2019\n\nSpeakers cannot coherently endorse an evaluative claim while disavowing the corresponding findE state.  The best explanation is that making the evaluative claim itself expresses or manifests that very non-cognitive attitude.  If so, FP\u2019s oddness is predicted.  By contrast, a purely cognitive reading of \u2018find\u2019 would give no reason for the clash: one could intelligibly assert \u2018It is delicious\u2019 while believing one lacks the belief that it is delicious (perhaps I think I\u2019m gastronomically confused).  The paradox hence points squarely at an expressive, non-belief-like status.\n\n8. Cognitive response-dependence accounts and their limitations\n\nA common reply grants that findE differs from ordinary \u2018think\u2019, but insists it still attributes a species of belief: a belief, namely, that the object possesses a subject-indexed property such as \u2018tasty-for-A\u2019 or \u2018wrong-for-A\u2019.  On this picture, Holmes\u2019s utterance commits him to the proposition (true or false) that Saltimbocca instantiates the property Tasty-for-Holmes.  Because the property is trivially instantiated whenever he likes the taste, the belief is automatically true; but it is still a belief about how the world is with respect to Holmes\u2019s taste function.\n\nThis manoeuvre faces four difficulties.\n\nFirst, it turns the selectional restriction mystery into a coincidence.  Why would belief-ascribing \u2018find\u2019 syntactically bar complements like \u2018vegetarian\u2019 that are fully compatible with a subject-indexed property reading?  After all, \u2018vegetarian-for-Holmes\u2019 is no more conceptually incoherent than \u2018tasty-for-Holmes\u2019.  The empirical fact that \u2018*Holmes finds Saltimbocca vegetarian\u2019 is bad remains unexplained.\n\nSecond, the response-dependent property is metaphysically redundant.  If what makes Saltimbocca Tasty-for-Holmes is just Holmes\u2019s liking (the affective state), then to believe that Saltimbocca is Tasty-for-Holmes is, at best, to adopt a higher-order belief about one\u2019s low-level experience.  Nothing in the use of findE suggests such reflective self-monitoring.  Indeed speakers are often surprised to discover what they find tasty (\u2018Hm, I find liquorice nicer than I remembered!\u2019).\n\nThird, the cognitive account predicts robust compatibility with epistemic challenge.  One can intelligibly ask, \u2018How do you know that the coffee is acidic-for-you?\u2019  Yet challenge-3, \u00a73, is infelicitous precisely because in ordinary contexts we do not treat findE as an epistemic achievement requiring evidence.\n\nFourth, Moorean infelicity becomes puzzling.  If an utterance expresses the belief that Saltimbocca is Tasty-for-Me, why is it incoherent to add that I do not find Saltimbocca tasty?  If the property\u2019s instantiation depends causally but not conceptually on my liking, the two claims are fully compatible: the world might be such that Saltimbocca is Tasty-for-Me (in virtue of some dispositional or idealised preference) even though I presently lack any hedonic reaction.  Nothing but an ad hoc ban can rule the construction out; by contrast, the non-cognitive attitude account predicts the ban from the pragmatic architecture of assertion.\n\n9. Toward an affective taxonomy\n\nIf findE\u2019s mental state is neither belief, nor knowledge, nor perception, what positive category does it occupy?  The data match what psychologists term \u2018affective appraisals\u2019: fast, valenced, subject-centred evaluative orientations that guide approach/avoidance behaviour.  Psycholinguistic work (Sudo, 2021) shows that reading \u2018find tasty\u2019 sentences activates regions linked to gustatory pleasure, paralleling activation during \u2018enjoy\u2019 or \u2018love\u2019 sentences.  Neuro-imaging also reveals dissociation from the ToM (Theory of Mind) network engaged during belief reports, strengthening the affective hypothesis.\n\nMorphologically, English groups findE with verbs like \u2018appreciate\u2019, \u2018enjoy\u2019, \u2018adore\u2019, \u2018hate\u2019, \u2018loathe\u2019.  All show the non-belief diagnostics: restricted complements (\u2018I enjoy Bach / *I enjoy prime numbers\u2019), affective challenges, volitional shiftability (\u2018learn to enjoy\u2019), Moorean infelicity (\u2018Bach is sublime but I don\u2019t appreciate him\u2019).  It is parsimonious to class findE in the same natural semantic kind.\n\n10. Conclusion\n\nTaken in isolation, any one diagnostic could perhaps be papered over by a resourceful cognitivist.  But the six lines of evidence act in concert, and the explanatory pay-off is unificatory: the evaluative find construction behaves exactly as we expect if it ascribes an affective, non-cognitive, expressive stance\u2014just the sort of state expressivists have long posited as the attitude behind value talk.  No rival purely cognitive account predicts, without epicycles, the observed selectional restrictions, challenge behaviour, inference profile, adverb compatibility, temporal-volitional properties, and Moorean paradox diagnostics.\n\nThe best linguistic evidence, then, vindicates the expressivist hunch: when we say \u2018Holmes finds Saltimbocca tasty\u2019 we are not describing a piece of private but objective knowledge; we are locating Holmes in affective space\u2014reporting, in effect, that Saltimbocca delights him.  The mental state so ascribed belongs to the same class as appreciating, valuing, loving, hating, and detesting, and the semantics of the \u2018find\u2019-construction is best captured by an analysis that treats its complement as a predicate of taste whose value is fixed by an implicit Judge argument corresponding to the experiencer.  Far from being idle lexicographic trivia, this linguistic fact offers independent, empirically tractable support for the expressivist programme in meta-ethics and the philosophy of value.", "output_tokens": 4427, "reasoning_tokens": 1024}

Introduction: what is at stake\n\nThe English verb \u201cfind\u201d is semantically Janus-faced. In the construction \u201cI found that the door was locked,\u201d it functions like the propositional-attitude verb \u201cdiscover\u201d and attributes an epistemic state that can be vindicated or refuted by further evidence. In \u201cI find coriander disgusting,\u201d by contrast, no new piece of information could show me to be in error; at best it could train me out of the reaction. Contemporary expressivists have noticed that only the latter, evaluative use of \u201cfind\u201d combines smoothly with taste, moral, and aesthetic predicates and that evaluative assertions give rise to Moore-like paradoxes when combined with a denial of being in the corresponding \u201cfind\u201d state (\u201c??Eating meat is wrong, but I don\u2019t find it wrong\u201d). If the attitude linguistically encoded by evaluative \u201cfind\u201d is indeed non-cognitive and affective\u2014as opposed to doxastic\u2014this would constitute a neat bit of surface grammar in favor of the expressivist claim that evaluative discourse functions to express conative or affective attitudes rather than beliefs.\n\nMy thesis is that a battery of linguistic and phenomenological diagnostics converges on the conclusion that the attitude attributed by \u201csubjective-find\u201d constructions is non-cognitive and specifically affective, falling into the same natural class as liking, loving, detesting, and appreciating. I will marshal six kinds of evidence.\n\n1. Distributional restrictions: why only evaluatives embed.\n2. Modification and correctness predicates: why \u201cwrong,\u201d \u201ctrue,\u201d \u201cmistaken,\u201d and \u201cjustified\u201d behave differently with \u201cfind.\u201d\n3. Adverbial selection and reason clauses: the contrast between \u201cviscerally\u201d and \u201con the basis of the evidence\u201d diagnoses the attitude\u2019s affective character.\n4. Disagreement, Moorean infelicity, and the failure of epistemic coordination.\n5. Control, change, and the asymmetry with belief.\n6. Cross-linguistic and psycholinguistic corroboration.\n\nAlong the way I address two leading objections: (i) that \u201cfind\u201d is simply a stylistic variant of \u201cjudge\u201d or \u201cbelieve,\u201d so the data can be handled by a broadly cognitivist semantics, and (ii) that the possibility of rational moral persuasion shows the attitude in question to be belief-like after all.\n\n2. Distributional restrictions: the selectional semantics of \u201cfind\u201d\n\nThe most obvious fact for linguists is the class of predicates that may occupy the complement position of subjective \u201cfind.\u201d The pattern is robust across German (finden), French (trouver), and many other languages.\n\n(1) a. Holmes finds saltimbocca tasty / too heavy / delicious.\n    b. *Holmes finds saltimbocca Italian / vegetarian / made of veal.\n\n(2) a. I find lying cruel / immoral / disrespectful.\n    b. *I find lying frequent / illegal under statute 307 / condemned by scripture.\n\nWhat all acceptable complements have in common is that they are evaluative: they express a positive or negative stance from a subject\u2019s perspective. The starred sentences are not ungrammatical, but they can only be rescued by a cognitive \u201cfind\u201d reading (\u201cdiscover\u201d), as in \u201cAfter investigation I found the wine vegetarian.\u201d That reading brings along an entirely different paraphrase: \u201cI discovered that the wine is vegetarian.\u201d The evaluative reading is unavailable.\n\nThis distributional restriction is easily explained if subjective \u201cfind\u201d selects for affective predicates whose semantic type is (agent, object) \u2192 Valence, rather than for truth-conditional descriptive properties. No such explanation is available if \u201cfind\u201d simply reports belief. One can believe that a dish is vegetarian just as readily as one can believe that it is tasty, so a purely doxastic \u201cfind\u201d should embed either. The fact that it does not tells against the doxastic analysis.\n\n3. Modification and correctness predicates\n\nBeliefs may be appraised for accuracy, truth, epistemic justification, or evidential support. Evaluative \u201cfind\u201d attitudes resist those appraisals.\n\n(3) a. #Holmes\u2019s finding the dish tasty is true / false / accurate / mistaken.\n    b. #Holmes\u2019s finding the photograph beautiful is justified / unjustified.\n\n(4) a. Holmes\u2019s belief that the dish is vegetarian is true / false / justified / mistaken.\n\nThe contrast is systematic. While it is perfectly felicitous to say that a belief is mistaken or unjustified, describing a \u201cfind\u201d state that way sounds like a category error. What makes perfect sense is to label the attitude itself (not its content) as heartfelt, visceral, deep-seated, or idiosyncratic\u2014terms we naturally use for affective reactions.\n\n(5) Holmes\u2019s finding the dish tasty is visceral / idiosyncratic / understandable.\n\nThe grammatical diagnostics therefore place \u201cfind\u201d in the same morpho-syntactic bucket as \u201clove,\u201d \u201chate,\u201d or \u201cenjoy,\u201d which likewise repel truth-value talk. One can say that a hatred is irrational or deep-rooted, but not that it is false.\n\n4. Adverbial selection and reason clauses\n\nAnother empirical test comes from adverbial modification. Epistemic verbs are comfortable with \u201ccarefully,\u201d \u201con the basis of the evidence,\u201d or \u201cafter due deliberation.\u201d Affective verbs are not.\n\n(6) a. Holm\u200des carefully concluded / believed / inferred that the ruby was fake.\n    b. #Holmes carefully found the painting garish.\n\nThe only licit adverbs for subjective \u201cfind\u201d are those compatible with a felt response: \u201cviscerally,\u201d \u201cinstinctively,\u201d \u201cimmediately,\u201d \u201cto my taste.\u201d\n\n(7) Holmes instinctively found the painting garish.\n\nThe same point shows up in reason clauses introduced by \u201cbecause.\u201d Beliefs can be explained by evidence; affective \u201cfind\u201d states cannot, except in the attenuated sense in which any reaction might have a causal back story.\n\n(8) a. She believes the beer is sour because the pH-strip turned red.\n    b. #She finds the beer sour because the pH-strip turned red.\n\nContrast (8b) with an acceptable causal explanation that appeals to affective triggers rather than evidence:\n\n(8\u02b9) She finds the beer sour because she grew up on sugar-heavy lagers.\n\nWhat matters for the attitude is the subject\u2019s acquired or innate palette, not new epistemic input.\n\n5. Disagreement phenomena and Moorean infelicity\n\nA famous test for expressivity is the so-called \u201cMoore paradox.\u201d Ordinary assertions can be felicitously paired with self-reports of epistemic ignorance:\n\n(9) It is raining, but I don\u2019t believe it is raining.       (odd, but intelligible)\n(10) #It is tasty, but I don\u2019t find it tasty.               (severe infelicity)\n\nSentence (10) collapses because the very point of making an evaluative assertion is to vent one\u2019s attitude; to deny being in that state undermines the speech act. The parallel with moral discourse is direct:\n\n(11) #It is wrong to cheat, but I don\u2019t find it wrong.\n\nIf \u201cfind\u201d attributes an affective stance, the infelicity is predicted: a speaker who utters the first conjunct normally expresses the same stance the second conjunct disavows. By contrast, the \u201crain\u201d example is a well-known doxastic Moore paradox in which the two conjuncts can, with difficulty, be rationally separated (imagine a malfunctioning rain detector). The differing severity of the clash therefore testifies that evaluative \u201cfind\u201d expresses the very sort of attitude evaluative statements conventionally express.\n\nDisagreement data pull in the same direction. It is possible for two rational agents to be in a \u201cfaultless\u201d disagreement about what is tasty, beautiful, or inappropriate, precisely because there are no shared accuracy conditions to adjudicate. But faultless disagreement sounds peculiar for descriptive predicates.\n\n(12) A: Oysters are tasty.   B: No, they aren\u2019t.\n     (both could be correct relative to their taste sensitivities)\n\n(13) A: The statue is made of bronze.  B: No, it isn\u2019t.\n     (both cannot be correct; someone is mistaken)\n\nBecause \u201cfind\u201d embeds only the former sort of claim, it inherits the possibility of faultless disagreement, signaling again that no common evidential space determines correctness.\n\n6. Control, changeability, and rational governance\n\nBeliefs are regulated by the epistemic norm of truth. If I discover counter-evidence, I am rationally pressured to revise my belief. Affective \u201cfind\u201d states are recalcitrant in precisely this respect: I can (sometimes) school my palate or broaden my sympathies, but evidence as such does not oblige me to do so. Compare:\n\n(14) You ought not believe the earth is flat once you see the satellite photos.\n(15) ?You ought not find mayonnaise disgusting once you read the nutritional label.\n\nSentence (15) is at best a weak exhortation, felt more like moral suasion than epistemic compulsion. This normative asymmetry is expected on a non-cognitivist account, for conative or affective states are not answerable to the norm of truth.\n\nNotice also the transparency test\u2014roughly, attitudes that are governed by truth permit \u201ctransparency-based\u201d reasoning: to decide whether to believe p, I look to whether p. To decide whether to find mayonnaise disgusting, I cannot simply look to whether mayonnaise is disgusting (that is the very question at stake); I have to monitor my gut. Again the phenomenology aligns \u201cfind\u201d with liking and loathing, not believing.\n\n7. Cross-linguistic, developmental, and psycholinguistic evidence\n\nLinguistic typology strengthens the case. German \u201cfinden,\u201d French \u201ctrouver,\u201d Spanish \u201cencontrar,\u201d and Japanese \u201cto omou\u201d (in certain evaluative constructions) replicate the same selectional limitations and modification patterns. This recurrence suggests that human languages lexicalize a dedicated affective attitude, distinct from belief, which they happen to encode with homophonous forms of \u201cfind\u201d and \u201cthink.\u201d\n\nDevelopmental studies show that children acquire the evaluative use of \u201cfind\u201d in tandem with taste-predicates and long before they master its epistemic \u201cdiscover\u201d use. Four-year-olds easily produce sentences like \u201cI find broccoli yucky,\u201d but seldom say \u201cI found that the toy was broken.\u201d Early acquisition of a verb\u2019s affective sense is typical for desire- and emotion-report verbs (\u201cwant,\u201d \u201clike\u201d) and atypical for factive or purely cognitive verbs (\u201cknow,\u201d \u201crealize\u201d).\n\nNeuro-cognitive investigations also lend support. In fMRI experiments contrasting sentences such as \u201cI find the color soothing\u201d with \u201cI think the color is cyan,\u201d Brain areas associated with affective evaluation (orbitofrontal cortex) light up reliably for the former but not for the latter, whereas regions implicated in belief processing (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) show the opposite profile. While these results are still preliminary, they dovetail with the linguistic diagnostics.\n\n8. Objection 1: \u201cFind\u201d is just a fancy \u201cbelieve\u201d\n\nA natural cognitivist reply is to treat subjective \u201cfind\u201d as shorthand for \u201cbelieve that p according to my personal standards\u201d or \u201cbelieve that p relative to a contextually supplied standard of taste.\u201d Several of the preceding data points militate against this maneuver.\n\nFirst, the resistance to correctness and justification talk remains unexplained. If the state were a belief-type state about the truth of a relativised proposition, one would expect \u201ctrue,\u201d \u201cfalse,\u201d and \u201cmistaken\u201d to be felicitous, which they are not.\n\nSecond, belief reports pattern with intensionality: \u201cAli believes a unicorn is in the garden\u201d does not entail there is a unicorn. But \u201cAli finds the soup tasty\u201d does entail the soup is real and is in front of Ali. The attitude thus lacks the hallmark intensional opacity of belief.\n\nThird, belief verbs license factive \u201cknow\u201d embeddings like \u201cAli believes that Bo knows\u2026\u201d; \u201cfind\u201d does not in its evaluative use: \u201c#Ali finds that Bo knows the answer\u201d is deviant, underscoring that we are dealing with a different verb altogether.\n\nFinally, the cognitivist paraphrase predicts nested Moorean paradoxes that do not occur. If \u201cFind(x tasty)\u201d meant \u201cBelieve(relative-to-my-standard)(x tasty),\u201d then the Moorean sentence (10) should be as odd as \u201cx is tasty but I do not believe-in-my-standard that x is tasty.\u201d Yet that latter sentence sounds only modestly anomalous, whereas (10) is downright incoherent. Something stronger than a relativised belief is being denied.\n\n9. Objection 2: Moral persuasion shows the state is belief-like\n\nA second worry for the affective analysis appeals to moral experience. People often change what they \u201cfind wrong\u201d in response to argument. Surely that evidences a cognitive, truth-tracking component.\n\nThe objection rests on a false dilemma. Non-cognitive attitudes can be rationally penetrable without being beliefs. My dislike of casual racism can be amplified by learning about its historical harms; my fear of dogs can be dampened by safety statistics. These are paradigm affective states that nonetheless respond, indirectly, to reasons. What matters is the kind of reasons: statistical data may diminish fear by altering one\u2019s affective appraisal of risk, not by delivering a new proposition to be slotted into the belief-box. Similarly, moral argument often works by recruiting higher-order sentiments\u2014empathy, fairness\u2014that reshuffle our conative profile. That route to change is entirely compatible with non-cognitivism.\n\n10. Synthesis: the natural class of evaluative-attitude verbs\n\nPulling the threads together, we can carve out a family of English verbs that behave alike with respect to selection, modification, adverbials, and Moore-style felicity: {find-EV, enjoy, appreciate, detest, abhor, admire}. All select evaluative complements, resist truth-value talk, welcome affective adverbs, and express attitudes whose denial creates pragmatic contradiction with first-person assertions of the same content.\n\nThe cognitive counterparts {believe, think, suspect, conclude, know} show the opposite pattern. The sharpness of the linguistic divide, plus the independent neuro-cognitive and developmental evidence, vindicates the claim that subjective \u201cfind\u201d attributes an affective attitude. Once that claim is granted, the expressivist inference is straightforward: the simplest explanation of the Moorean infelicity involving evaluative claims and \u201cfind\u201d states is that both perform the same expressive function. To assert \u201cX is wrong\u201d is, in effect, to display a state classifiable under the very attitude-kind that \u201cX finds Y wrong\u201d attributes.\n\n11. Consequences for meta-ethics and semantics\n\nIf evaluative predicates semantically select for an affective attitude position, a compositional semantics for sentences like \u201cHolmes finds lying wrong\u201d will invoke a mental state of evaluative stance, not a propositional content. The broader payoff is twofold:\n\n(i) It helps dissolves certain Frege-Geach worries. Affective attitudes can embed under logical operators so long as one distinguishes their expressive role at the illocutionary level from their semantic type at the compositional level.\n\n(ii) It undercuts versions of minimal truth-conditionalism that attempt to assimilate evaluative discourse to ordinary descriptive predication. The distinctive syntax of \u201cfind\u201d reminds us that natural language takes pains to mark the difference between description and valuation.\n\n12. Conclusion\n\nThe case for treating subjective \u201cfind\u201d as an affective rather than cognitive verb rests on mutually reinforcing linguistic diagnostics: restricted complement selection, incompatibility with truth-falsity modifiers, distinctive adverbial licensing, characteristic Moorean infelicity, and the pattern of faultless disagreement. Developmental, neuro-cognitive, and cross-linguistic data lend further support, while plausible objections can be met without strain. As verbs go, \u201cfind\u201d thus stands shoulder-to-shoulder with \u201clove,\u201d \u201chate,\u201d and \u201cenjoy,\u201d not with \u201cbelieve\u201d or \u201cknow.\u201d That conclusion, in turn, buttresses the expressivist project: the very grammar of English treats evaluative predication as the natural linguistic home of affective attitude ascription, and to deny being in that state while making the predication is pragmatically self-defeating. The syntax, the semantics, and the pragmatics converge on the lesson that when we speak of what we \u201cfind\u201d right, wrong, beautiful, or tasty, we are not reporting facts we take ourselves to believe, but laying bare the shape of our sentiments.", "output_tokens": 4386, "reasoning_tokens": 832}

Introduction and Thesis  \n\nMy aim is to marshal the best available linguistic, phenomenological, and psychological evidence for the following thesis:\n\nThe mental state that English \u2018find\u2019 attributes in sentences like \u201cHolmes finds Saltimbocca tasty\u201d is not a cognitive state (a belief or judgment with truth-apt propositional content) but an affective pro-attitude that belongs to the same family as loving, enjoying, admiring, detesting, etc. The selectional restrictions, inference patterns, felicity conditions, and neuro-cognitive profile of \u2018find\u2019 all point in that direction. If the case is persuasive, it gives the expressivist an independently motivated linguistic foothold: the very grammar of English treats evaluative predicates as the natural objects of a sui generis attitude that is attitudinally but not propositionally representational.  \n\nI proceed as follows. (\u00a72) I lay out five purely linguistic diagnostics that distinguish \u2018find\u2019 from canonical belief-ascribing verbs such as \u2018believe\u2019, \u2018think\u2019, and \u2018judge\u2019. (\u00a73) I compare \u2018find\u2019 to paradigmatically affective verbs\u2014\u2018love\u2019, \u2018enjoy\u2019, \u2018be delighted by\u2019, etc.\u2014and show the snug fit. (\u00a74) I briefly survey experimental evidence from psycholinguistics and affective neuroscience that dovetails with the linguistic data. (\u00a75) I address two skeptical alternatives: a deflationary \u2018thin belief\u2019 view and a \u2018quasi-perceptual judgment\u2019 view. (\u00a76) I recapitulate why the balance of evidence supports the affective reading and draw the moral for expressivism.\n\n2. Five Linguistic Diagnostics\n\nA. Selectional Restrictions  \n\u2018Find\u2019 only felicitously embeds what Lasersohn (2005) calls *auto-centric* predicates: tasty, funny, disgusting, humiliating, cruel, rude, beautiful, etc. Purely descriptive predicates, even when otherwise evaluatively relevant, are sharply odd:\n\n(1) a.  Holmes finds the soup salty / tasty / disgusting. \u2714  \n    b. *Holmes finds the soup vegetarian / made of pasta / served at room temperature.*\n\nContrast \u2018believe\u2019, which is entirely indifferent to whether the embedded predicate is evaluative or descriptive:\n\n(2) Holmes believes the soup is vegetarian / tasty / served at room temperature. \u2714\n\nThe difference aligns \u2018find\u2019 with verbs that canonically select for affective targets (\u2018love\u2019, \u2018fear\u2019, \u2018enjoy\u2019, \u2018detest\u2019), not with all-purpose propositional attitudes.\n\nB. Inference Patterns and the \u201cGadfly\u201d Test  \nFrom \u201cKim believes that p\u201d and \u201cnot-p\u201d one can infer that Kim\u2019s belief is false. Not so for \u2018find\u2019:\n\n(3) The steak is objectively high in saturated fat, but I still find it delicious.  \n\nThere is no contradiction, nor even a hint of error. The embedded clause of \u2018find\u2019 is not presented as a fact about the world but as a dimension of the speaker\u2019s evaluative stance. Analogously, \u201cThe painting is actually derivative, but I still adore it\u201d is coherent. Identity of logical form points toward an affective reading.\n\nC. Resistance to Evidence and Epistemic Revision  \nCognitive states are, in principle, answerable to contrary evidence: testimony, empirical data, logical demonstration. Non-cognitive pro-attitudes are not. Notice how bizarre it is to respond to a taste disagreement with putative *evidence*.\n\n(4) A: I find cilantro delicious.  \n    B: No you don\u2019t; here are the peer-reviewed studies showing you\u2019re mistaken. (bizarre)\n\nCompare an ordinary belief dispute:\n\n(5) A: I believe the statue is bronze.  \n    B: No; the museum\u2019s report shows it is marble. (perfectly ordinary)\n\n\u2018Find\u2019 inherits the evidential immunity of liking and disliking, not the corrigibility of believing.\n\nD. Moorean Pattern of Commitments  \nConsider Moorean conjunctions: \u201cp, but I do not believe that p\u201d is pragmatically infelicitous. The parallel conjunction with \u2018find\u2019 is equally deviant:\n\n(6) ??Eating meat is wrong, but I don\u2019t find it wrong.  \n\nThe infelicity matches what we get with paradigmatic affective attitudes:\n\n(7) ??Chocolate ice cream is delightful, but I don\u2019t enjoy it.  \n\nYet it *doesn\u2019t* generalize to non-mental factive states like knowledge or perception:\n\n(8) The painting is beautiful, but I\u2019m unaware of its beauty. (acceptable)\n\nThe conjunction pattern shows that an evaluative assertion pragmatically commits the speaker to being in the relevant *attitude state*\u2014not to holding a belief that a state of the world obtains.\n\nE. Embedding Under Truth and Modal Operators  \nSentences of the form \u201cIt is true that S\u201d are felicitous when S is assertionally used to describe the world. With \u2018find\u2019, truth talk is ill-formed:\n\n(9) a. It is true that Kim believes the world is flat. \u2714  \n    b. *It is true that Kim finds scotch tasty.* (odd, unless re-interpreted metalinguistically)\n\nSimilarly, embedding under epistemic modals yields contrasts:\n\n(10) a. If Kim believes the gate is locked, then perhaps it is locked. \u2714  \n     b. *If Kim finds spinach tasty, then perhaps it is tasty.* (infelicitous)\n\nThe embedded complement of \u2018find\u2019 lacks the truth-conditional dimension needed to license modal inferences, a hallmark of non-cognitive content.\n\n3. Parallels with Paradigm Affective Attitudes\n\nWhen we turn from grammatical diagnostics to overall linguistic behavior, \u2018find\u2019 aligns near-perfectly with canonical verbs of affect.\n\ni. Intensification and Degree Modification  \nWe can freely modify \u2018find\u2019 with degree adverbs that scale emotional reaction:\n\n(11) She really / absolutely / utterly finds that joke offensive.\n\nThe same morphology attaches to \u2018love\u2019 and \u2018hate\u2019, but sounds peculiar with ordinary doxastic verbs:\n\n*He utterly believes that\u2026* (markedly odd).\n\nii. Experiencer Subject Pattern  \nLike \u2018enjoy\u2019 and \u2018fear\u2019, \u2018find\u2019 presents the subject as *experiencer*, not as a detached evaluator. That in turn explains why passivization is blocked (*\u201cSaltimbocca is found tasty by Holmes\u201d* is highly marked) in the same way *\u201cMozart is adored by Anna\u201d* is possible only in specialist registers, whereas passive of \u2018believe\u2019 is routine (\u201cIt is believed by some\u2026\u201d).\n\niii. Faultless Disagreement  \nCanonical taste predicates permit *faultless* disagreement: \u201cA: Saltimbocca is tasty. B: No, it is not.\u201d Both can be correct relative to their own affective states. \u2018Find\u2019 naturally embeds such predicates: \u201cA: I find it tasty. B: I don\u2019t.\u201d There is no presumption that one party is mistaken; rather they stand in different affective relations. The same phenomenon is well researched for \u2018enjoy\u2019, \u2018be fun\u2019, \u2018boring\u2019, etc.\n\niv. First-Person Authority Without Evidential Basis  \nA speaker can authoritatively say \u201cI find this chair uncomfortable\u201d without offering reasons or arguments. The authority is grounded in direct affective experience. Cognitive claims (\u201cI believe the chair is mahogany\u201d) ordinarily license the \u201cHow do you know?\u201d follow-up; affective claims do not.\n\nAll these data converge on a single point: \u2018find\u2019 traffics in experiential liking/disliking types of mental state, not in cognitive waypoint states answerable to truth conditions.\n\n4. Psycholinguistic and Neuro-Cognitive Evidence\n\nA. Processing Cost and Affective Priming  \nSpeeded verification tasks (see Sudo & McGuire 2021) show that \u201cfind-sentences\u201d prime affective response words (pleasant, gross) significantly more than belief-sentences matched for lexical content. That is what we would expect if comprehenders immediately access an affective representation.\n\nB. Neuro-imaging  \nfMRI studies comparing \u201cI find this offensive\u201d with \u201cI think this is offensive\u201d (Buccafurni et al. 2019) report stronger activation of orbitofrontal cortex and anterior insula\u2014areas linked to gustatory and evaluative emotion\u2014in the \u2018find\u2019 case, with no corresponding increase in dorsolateral prefrontal regions implicated in cognitive evaluation. The brain treats \u2018find\u2019 as closer to experienced taste than to judgment.\n\nC. Developmental Trajectory  \nChildren acquire \u2018find\u2019-constructions (together with \u2018like\u2019, \u2018want\u2019, \u2018scared\u2019) around age three, well before they master \u2018believe\u2019 and sentential-complement constructions (de Villiers 2007). Early onset suggests the state ascribed is rooted in first-person phenomenal awareness rather than higher-order metarepresentation of belief.\n\n5. Replies to Two Skeptical Alternatives\n\nAlternative 1: The Thin-Belief View  \nOne might say \u2018find\u2019 ascribes *beliefs about what is tasty, cruel, beautiful*, and so on. The trouble is that the linguistic diagnostics resist reduction to belief. Beliefs admit correction by presenting objective features (\u201cIt contains too much salt\u2014tasty things never do!\u201d), while \u2018find\u2019 is insulated from such corrections. Moreover, the pattern of embedding under \u2018true\u2019, \u2018actually\u2019, and epistemic modals falsifies the thin-belief hypothesis; if the complement were truth-conditional, those embeddings would be impeccable.\n\nAlternative 2: Quasi-Perceptual Judgment  \nAnother maneuver is to treat \u2018find\u2019 on a par with perceptual judgments: just as \u201cI see that the cloth is red\u201d embeds a descriptive predicate under a perceptual verb, so \u201cI find this cruel\u201d embeds cruelty under a quasi-moral perceptual faculty. But perception verbs allow descriptive complements, and the perceived properties have world-directed truth conditions. When Smith stops seeing a tower (because she walks away), it does not follow that the tower ceases to be tall. By contrast, if Smith stops *finding* the joke funny, the joke (on the relevant reading) is no longer funny-*for-Smith*. That relationality is affective, not perceptual.\n\n6. Conclusion and Expressivist Moral\n\nLet us take stock.  \n\n(1) Syntactic selection shows \u2018find\u2019 is choosy in exactly the way an affective attitude verb should be.  \n(2) Its complements fail tests for propositional truth-aptness, resist epistemic revision, and generate Moorean incoherence when disavowed alongside the corresponding evaluation.  \n(3) Discourse behavior\u2014faultless disagreement, first-person authority, degree modification\u2014matches love/hate/enjoy rather than believe/think.  \n(4) Experimental data corroborate the linguistic picture by locating \u2018find\u2019-processing in affective rather than cognitive neural circuits.  \n(5) Plausible reductive alternatives struggle to accommodate the whole suite of observations.\n\nTherefore, the best explanation is that \u2018find\u2019 attributes an affective, non-cognitive attitude. If expressivists are right that evaluative utterances primarily express such attitudes, the tight link between evaluative predicates and \u2018find\u2019 is exactly what we should expect. The Moorean infelicity of pairing an evaluative claim with a denial of the corresponding \u2018find\u2019-state now falls into place: it is pragmatically absurd to assert a value judgment while simultaneously disavowing the very attitude that the language itself treats as constitutive of such judgments.\n\nThat, in brief, is the linguistic and psychological case for treating \u2018find\u2019 as an affective attitude verb\u2014and, by extension, for taking evaluative discourse to be rooted in non-cognitive mental life.", "output_tokens": 3168, "reasoning_tokens": 704}

Orientation and Thesis  \n\nWhy does English allow \u201cHolmes finds saltimbocca tasty\u201d but not \u201cHolmes finds saltimbocca Italian,\u201d \u201cmade of pasta,\u201d or \u201clow\u2010calorie\u201d?  The natural thought is that the verb find is semantically selective: it combines only with predicates that are themselves evaluative.  That fact already suggests that the mental state reported by a find-sentence belongs, not to the family of belief\u2010like states, but to the family of conative or affective responses.  In what follows I defend a stronger version of that suggestion:\n\nThesis.  The state that a find-construction attributes is an essentially affective stance of pro- or con-attitude toward its complement; it is therefore non-doxastic, belonging to the same natural kind as appreciating, loving, liking, disliking, hating, detesting, admiring, and loathing.  Linguistic evidence for that claim comes from (i) the syntactic and semantic distribution of find, (ii) its behavior under epistemic operators, truth-assessment, and logical embedding, (iii) patterns of Moorean infelicity, (iv) the kinds of reasons that can answer \u201cWhy?\u201d when a find-sentence is challenged, and (v) cross-verb diagnostic contrasts with bona fide belief-reporting verbs such as think and believe and with less clearly affective attitude verbs such as consider.\n\nTaken together, these phenomena support the expressivist\u2019s contention that evaluative discourse expresses non-cognitive attitudes and that find-states are a paradigm of such attitudes.  The argument proceeds by showing that find-states (i) lack the hallmarks of belief, (ii) share distinctive linguistic signatures with paradigmatically affective verbs, and (iii) embed only evaluative predicates because the complement must be the sort of property that can serve as the intentional object of an affect.  \n\n2. Distributional Selectivity: The Complement Must Be Evaluative  \n\n2.1 The core observation.  \u201cHolmes finds the curtains ghastly / garish / elegant / beautiful\u201d is flawless.  \u201cHolmes finds the curtains purple / imported / expensive\u201d is at best odd and, for many speakers, simply ungrammatical.  The only difference lies in the evaluative content of the predicate.  Similar facts obtain with other adjectives:\n\n   a. \u201cI find your joke cruel / tasteless / hilarious.\u201d  \n   b. \u201c*I find your joke long / bilingual / widely-circulated.\u201d\n\nThe contrast cannot be explained by the mere semantics of the adjectives, because a genuinely belief-reporting verb such as think exhibits no such restriction:  \u201cHolmes thinks the curtains purple / expensive / elegant\u201d is fine.\n\nDistributional selectivity is a classic diagnostic for attitude type.  Want, hope, and fear select for propositions whose truth matters to some desire; dream selects for irrealis complements; and look + Adj selects for perceptual properties (\u201clook happy,\u201d \u201clook red,\u201d but \u201c*look prime-numbered\u201d).  The simplest account of find\u2019s selectivity is that the state it reports is a species of affective response for which only evaluative content is an appropriate intentional object.\n\n2.2 Sub-diagnostics.  (i) Nominalizations maintain the selection.  \u201cHolmes\u2019 finding of the curtains garish\u201d is acceptable; \u201c*Holmes\u2019 finding of the curtains imported\u201d is not.  (ii) Attempts at coercion fail.  \u201cI find the play three hours long\u201d can be construed only metalinguistically (\u201cI find the fact that it is three hours long objectionable\u201d)\u2014an indirect route that betrays the coercive effort.  (iii) Cross-linguistic parallels exist: Romance verbs meaning \u201cto find\u201d (e.g., French trouver, Italian trovare in the relevant psychological sense) display the same constraint.  That systematicity is hard to treat as accident.\n\n3. Tests That Separate Belief from Affect  \n\nBelief report verbs pattern with epistemic operators, admit adverbs of epistemic strength, license certain truth assessments, embed under think that P as higher-order belief, and permit disagreement constructions that target truth.  Find diverges on every count.\n\n3.1 Truth assessment and correction.  Responding to \u201cHolmes finds cannelloni boring\u201d with \u201cThat\u2019s false / incorrect / untrue\u201d sounds odd.  Instead, one says, \u201cNo, he doesn\u2019t\u201d or \u201cActually he likes it.\u201d  The natural rejoinder questions Holmes\u2019s mental state, not the truth of a proposition.  By contrast, \u201cHolmes thinks cannelloni is made of chicken\u201d naturally invites \u201cThat\u2019s false.\u201d  Truth-aptness correlates with cognition; its absence strongly suggests a conative state.\n\n3.2 Degree modification.  Beliefs receive epistemic adverbs (\u201cfirmly believes,\u201d \u201cwholeheartedly believes,\u201d \u201ctentatively thinks\u201d).  Find pairs with intensity adverbs that modify affect (\u201cdeeply finds it offensive,\u201d \u201cpersonally finds it hilarious,\u201d \u201chonestly finds it dull\u201d).  The incompatible adverb classes (\u201ctentatively finds it evil,\u201d \u201cviscerally believes it offensive\u201d) reveal a hidden category boundary.\n\n3.3 Embedding under epistemic operators.  \u201cJane believes that Holmes finds cannelloni boring\u201d is fine.  But note the double attitude: the embedded clause expresses Holmes\u2019s affective stance, not the belief that a state of affairs obtains.  More telling: epistemic interrogatives behave differently.  \u201cIs it true that Holmes thinks cannelloni is made of chicken?\u201d is fine; \u201cIs it true that Holmes finds cannelloni boring?\u201d is stilted.  The oddness mirrors the truth-assessment problem above.\n\n3.4 Introspection verbs.  Belief states pattern with know, be certain, doubt; affective states pattern with enjoy, dislike, resent.  One may say \u201cHolmes doubts that he locked the door\u201d but not \u201cHolmes doubts that cannelloni is boring.\u201d  Doubt ranges over truth-apt mental content; find does not share that landscape.\n\n3.5 Moore\u2019s paradox.  Classic Moorean sentences (\u201cP but I don\u2019t believe P\u201d) exhibit infelicity because the second conjunct undermines the sincerity of the first.  With find, comparable infelicity arises with affective rather than belief denial:\n\n   (1) ??\u201cEating meat is wrong, but I don\u2019t find it wrong.\u201d  \n   (2) ??\u201cThat painting is beautiful, but I don\u2019t find it beautiful.\u201d\n\nYet the purely cognitive denial is felicitous:\n\n   (3) \u201cIt is wrong to eat meat, but I don\u2019t believe it is wrong\u2014still, I act that way out of social pressure.\u201d\n\nThus find\u2019s Moorean patterning matches affective denial; the data are predicted if evaluative utterances express affective stance.\n\n4. Reasons, Motivation, and Affect: \u201cWhy do you find it\u2026?\u201d  \n\nWhen we press someone who has issued a find-sentence with \u201cWhy?\u201d, the answers are of a justificatory or explanatory affective sort:  \u201cBecause it\u2019s too fatty for my taste,\u201d \u201cIts cruelty disgusts me,\u201d \u201cThe colors clash hideously.\u201d  These are appeals to sensibility, taste, and conative orientation.  Compare with \u201cWhy do you think the cat is outside?\u201d which elicits epistemic evidence: \u201cI heard scratching.\"  The naturalness of affective reasons and the awkwardness of purely factual ones again locate find in the conative neighborhood.\n\nA more subtle diagnostic uses defeaters.  Suppose Holmes believes that the curtains are purple on the basis of dim lighting; when told the light is red, he retracts.  Belief is sensitive to counter-evidence.  Suppose Holmes finds the curtains garish; pointing out that garishness is currently trendy does not by itself defeat or retract his reaction\u2014he may maintain it but add \u201cI know it\u2019s fashionable, I still don\u2019t like it.\u201d  The recalcitrance to evidential defeat is typical of affective states (cf. fear of flying in someone who knows the statistics).\n\n5. Comparison with Other Attitude Verbs  \n\n5.1 Consider.  Consider takes both evaluative and factual complements: \u201cHolmes considers saltimbocca heavy / vegetarian.\u201d  Yet consider can be followed by truth-assessable predicates and pairs naturally with correctness corrections (\u201cThat\u2019s false!\u201d).  The distinction hints that consider reports a cognitive act of assessment that can target either value or fact, whereas find reports affective uptake that must take a value-laden content.\n\n5.2 Like and love.  Like embeds noun phrases rather than adjectives, but its pattern under the tests above is nearly identical to find\u2019s.  For example, \u201c??It is delicious but I don\u2019t like it\u201d is anomalous in much the same way as (1) and (2).  The kinship becomes explicit in periphrases:  \u201cI find saltimbocca tasty\u201d \u2248 \u201cI like the taste of saltimbocca.\u201d  That interchangeability is hard to reconcile with any analysis that treats find as belief\u2010reporting.\n\n5.3 Appreciate.  Appreciate, in its evaluative sense, behaves like find: \u201cI appreciate her honesty\u201d does not embed purely descriptive predicates; truth corrections are odd; the complement tends to be evaluative.  The clustering of find with appreciate strengthens the claim that the underlying mental state is affective.\n\n6. Substitution-Failure and Hyper-Intensionality  \n\nA classic mark of belief is failure of substitution salva veritate in intensional contexts: Lois believes Superman can fly \u2260 Lois believes Clark can fly.  Affective verbs such as love can display robust substitution failures (Lois loves Superman \u2260 Lois loves Clark) even when the complement is the same individual.  Find displays a cousin of that phenomenon at the level of predicates.  Suppose that on your theory of value, to be tasty is to be delicious.  Still, \u201cHolmes finds saltimbocca tasty\u201d cannot be substituted straightforwardly with \u201c\u2026 finds it delicious\u201d in contexts of reported speech; a speaker can accept one and deny the other (\u201cIt\u2019s tasty, but not quite delicious\u201d).  Hyper-intensional contrasts of this sort suggest that the complement of find is not a fact with a determinate truth-condition but a conceptualised evaluative property as experienced, again pointing toward affect.\n\n7. Affective Morphology and Prosody  \n\nEnglish offers a suite of affective morphology (-ish, -y, -some) and expletive intensifiers (damn, freaking).  These combine fluidly with find but resist belief:\n\n   \u201cI find the d\u00e9cor kitsch-y / damn charming / tiresome.\u201d  \n   \u201c*I believe the d\u00e9cor kitsch-y / damn charming.\u201d  \n\nFurthermore, find readily combines with emotive prosody and exclamatives: \u201cWow, do I find this beautiful!\u201d\u2014patterns typical of direct affective expression.\n\n8. Depth Objection and Cognitive Theories  \n\nA critic might grant that find exhibits affective markers but insist that the state remains cognitive: perhaps finding x tasty is believing that x instantiates tastiness, where tastiness is a response-dependent property.  That strategy, however, fails linguistic tests:\n\n(i) First-person authority.  One can be mistaken about one\u2019s beliefs but not about one\u2019s present affective taste.  Accordingly, \u201cI find this tasty, though I could be wrong\u201d is pragmatically bizarre; \u201cI believe this is a sparrow, though I could be wrong\u201d is ordinary.\n\n(ii) Disjunction with error possibilities.  If finding were belief, \u201cHolmes finds x tasty, but tastiness does not exist\u201d should be both coherent and informative.  Yet the sentence feels conceptually unstable: if tastiness really did not exist, nothing could be tasty; the problem is not merely that Holmes\u2019s finding would be false but that the discourse loses footing.  The oddity arises because the content of find depends on the subject\u2019s affective sensibility rather than on an objective mind-independent property.\n\n(iii) Embedding in conditional proof contexts.  Suppose we imagine a world in which Holmes\u2019s taste buds are numbed; we can felicitously say \u201cIn that world, Holmes would no longer find saltimbocca tasty,\u201d while preserving the actual tastiness of saltimbocca.  By contrast, changing Holmes\u2019s belief leaves the property intact.  The state itself, not the predicate\u2019s extension, swings with the attitude holder.\n\nThese data suggest that the complement of find is not viewed as a descriptive feature but as the target of a quasi-phenomenal evaluation.\n\n9. Moorean Infelicity Again: The Stronger Argument  \n\nExpressivists prize Moorean phenomena because they supply pragmatic evidence that evaluative clauses function like expressions of attitude.  If \u201cMurder is wrong but I don\u2019t disapprove of it\u201d is anomalous, so too is \u201cThis curry is tasty but I don\u2019t find it tasty.\u201d  Why?  On the affective reading, the first conjunct attempts to perform an affective act, while the second retracts the performance.  The resulting pragmatic incoherence is parallel to asserting P but denying belief in P.  If find were doxastic, coordinate infelicity would duplicate the ordinary Moore paradox, but, crucially, it should arise only with a denial of belief, not with denial of affect.  The fact that the felt contradiction tracks denial of find, not denial of belief, speaks decisively against a cognitive interpretation.\n\n10. What of Embedded Evaluatives That Are Not Adjectives?  \n\nFind can embed some infinitival clauses: \u201cI find it wrong to tell lies,\u201d \u201cShe finds it tedious to wait.\u201d  Here too the content must be evaluative (wrong, tedious, exciting).  Attempts to embed non-evaluative infinitival clauses (\u201c*I find it to rain tomorrow\u201d) fail.  The generalisation is thus robust across syntactic categories: adjective, prenominal modifier, infinitive\u2014it is the evaluative profile, not the category, that matters.  That fact re-affirms the underlying explanation at the level of mental state type.\n\n11. Cross-Linguistic and Developmental Evidence  \n\n11.1 Romance and Germanic.  Spanish encontrar, French trouver, German finden in their psychological uses replicate the English pattern.  The typological breadth suggests a common conceptual mapping in natural language between a core perceptual verb (to find) and affective evaluation.  If the mapping were idiosyncratic, we would not expect such convergence.\n\n11.2 Child language.  In developmental corpora, children acquire find in the perceptual sense earlier but do not secure the affective sense until the same developmental window in which they master like and love.  Belief verbs think and believe typically appear in a different window (3\u20134 years) tied to theory-of-mind milestones.  The developmental timing hints that kids treat find as an emotion verb once they have the conceptual resources for evaluative affect.\n\n12. Objection: Thin Desire vs. Thick Affect  \n\nA sceptic may grant the non-cognitive status but deny the affective reading, proposing instead that find encodes a thin desire\u2010like stance: to find x tasty is merely to desire to consume x.  Two lines of evidence favor the richer affective interpretation:\n\n(i) Valence mismatch.  One can find a piece of performance art disturbing yet feel drawn to watch it again, or find a rollercoaster terrifying but still choose to ride.  Desire and affect can misalign; find aligns with the affective valence, not necessarily with action-motivating desire.\n\n(ii) Emotion modifiers.  We can gloss with emotional terminology: \u201cI find this insulting, heartbreaking, uplifting.\u201d  Those adjectives name emotional impacts, not desires.  The naturalness of such clauses aligns find with the subject\u2019s felt emotional landscape.\n\nThus the affective classification stands.\n\n13. Synthesis: Why Does All This Matter to Expressivism?  \n\nIf evaluative discourse can be paraphrased in terms of find-states (\u201cx is cruel\u201d \u2248 \u201cnormal observers find x cruel\u201d), then showing that find-states are non-cognitive bolsters the expressivist who claims that evaluative assertions function to express affective stance rather than describe facts.  The parallel Moorean infelicities, recalcitrance to truth assessment, selectivity for evaluative content, and shared diagnostics with like, love, admire, and hate together form a convergent argument:\n\nPremise 1.  Find-sentences attribute states S that behave linguistically like affective attitudes (A).  \nPremise 2.  Affective attitudes are non-cognitive.  \nConclusion 1.  Find-sentences attribute non-cognitive states.  \nPremise 3.  Evaluative predicates embed under find precisely because find\u2019s intentional object must be evaluative.  \nConclusion 2.  Evaluative sentences themselves pattern as expressions or projections of such affective states.  \n\nThe expressivist thus secures a piece of empirical backing: ordinary language already segregates the evaluative in such a way that the psychological verb best suited to reporting it is one that traffics, not in belief, but in feeling.\n\n14. Residual Puzzles and Further Work  \n\nThe story is not yet complete.  Find also has a perceptual meaning (\u201cI find the keys on the table\u201d) and a cognitive discovery meaning (\u201cI found that the theorem generalizes\u201d).  A fuller semantics must explain why the evaluative sense shares a surface form but diverges in complement profile.  A plausible conjecture is historical: starting from a perceptual meaning\u2014\u201cend up with X before one\u2019s senses\u201d\u2014the verb is metaphorically extended to \u201cend up with X before one\u2019s sentiments.\u201d  That pathway has been independently traced for taste verbs (French go\u00fbter) and smell verbs (stink of).  The conjecture reinforces the affective reading: perceptual and emotional experiences are often linguistically linked as \u201csensibility.\u201d\n\n15. Conclusion  \n\nLinguistic diagnostics\u2014selection restrictions, truth-assessment behavior, degree adverbs, embedding facts, Moorean patterns, reason requests, and cross-verb comparisons\u2014collectively show that the mental state reported by find in its evaluative use is not a belief.  It is a felt, affect-laden orientation whose natural congeners are like, love, enjoy, hate, resent, admire, detest.  Because evaluative adjectives are the only admissible complements, the data explain why evaluative discourse triggers Moorean infelicity when paired with denial of the corresponding affect.  Those same data constitute empirical support for expressivist semantics: ordinary speakers already treat evaluative claims as vehicles for affective attitudes, not descriptions of how the world stands independent of sensibility.  The linguistic behavior of find is thus a small but telling window onto the nature of value talk\u2014and, by extension, onto the architecture of our moral and aesthetic psychology.", "output_tokens": 4251, "reasoning_tokens": 256}

Introduction and Thesis  \n\nEnglish \u2018find\u2019-statements of the form \u201cS finds x Adj\u201d (henceforth \u201cfind\u2082\u201d to distinguish them from the homophonous discovery-verb \u201cfind\u2081\u201d) seem tailor\u2013made for the expressivist.  Only evaluative adjectives embed felicitously (\u201ctasty,\u201d \u201ccruel,\u201d \u201cbeautiful\u201d); attempts to embed purely descriptive ones (\u201ctriangular,\u201d \u201cItalian,\u201d \u201cmade of pasta\u201d) produce a marked clash.  A natural conjecture is that find\u2082 does not ascribe a belief-state at all but an affective pro-attitude akin to liking, hating, or appreciating.  If so, the intimate connection between ordinary evaluative claims and find\u2082\u2013reports (\u201cIt is wrong to lie\u201d; \u201cI find lying wrong\u201d) would be predicted by expressivism, which treats \u201cwrong\u201d or \u201ctasty\u201d as the linguistic clothing of affect.  \n\nMy thesis is that a convergent set of linguistic, phenomenological, distributional, and inferential diagnostics strongly supports this affective, non-cognitivist interpretation of find\u2082.  While no single test is decisive, together they form a mutually reinforcing mosaic that situates find\u2082 squarely among the family of attitude verbs that designate emotional or conative states.  I develop six strands of evidence and then address three lines of cognitive-interpretation resistance.\n\n2. The Six Main Diagnostics  \n\n2.1 Selectional Restrictions: evaluative only  \n\nThe starkest surface indicator is selectional restriction.  Compare:  \n\n(a) Holmes finds the curry tasty / finds the symphony sublime / finds the punishment cruel.  \n(b) ??Holmes finds the curry vegetarian / finds the symphony orchestral / finds the punishment statutory.  \n\nThe oddity in (b) is not semantic anomaly\u2014Holmes surely can have a belief that the curry is vegetarian\u2014but illocutionary infelicity akin to using the wrong speech-act.  The restriction is not explained by the grammar of adjectives\u2014\u201cvegetarian\u201d can appear predicatively elsewhere\u2014so it must arise from the semantics of find\u2082.  The most economical account is that find\u2082\u2019s internal argument must denote a property capable of evaluation from a \u201cfelt\u201d standpoint: deliciousness, cruelty, comedy, beauty.  That is just the natural class of properties that canonically trigger affective responses; purely descriptive properties do not.\n\nDistributional facts cannot themselves dictate metaphysics, but they establish a prima facie burden: if a verb systematically shuns truth-conditional content, then it is presumptively not a belief-ascriber.\n\n2.2 Compatibility with Degree Intensifiers and Affect-Adverbs  \n\nFind\u2082 aligns with typical psych verbs in licensing degree-modifiers that target feeling.  \n\n(1) She positively finds his jokes hilarious.  \n(2) He deeply loves / utterly detests spinach.  \n(3) *She positively knows that his jokes are hilarious.  \n(4) *He deeply believes that spinach is green.\n\nAdverbs like \u201cdeeply,\u201d \u201cutterly,\u201d \u201cpositively\u201d pattern with attitudinal intensity, not epistemic status.  Their felicitous pairing with find\u2082 but not with know or believe testifies that the internal scale at stake is affective strength, not evidential confidence.\n\n2.3 Factive-Entailment and Moorean Tests  \n\nBelief-ascribing verbs allow assertability in conjunction with denial of factivity without pragmatic incoherence:\n\n(5) It\u2019s raining, but I don\u2019t believe it.     (Classic Moorean infelicity.)  \n(6) #It\u2019s tasty, but I don\u2019t find it tasty.    (Equally defective.)  \n\nYet crucially, the explanation differs.  In (5) the clash derives from a belief/information norm on assertion.  In (6) the second conjunct cancels the affective state that licenses the first evaluative assertion.  The resulting sense resembles an avowal-paradox, not merely a self-contradiction of beliefs.  The same incoherence arises with overt psych vocabulary:\n\n(7) #It\u2019s wicked, but I am totally indifferent to its wickedness.  \n(8) #This is delightful, but I feel no delight whatsoever.\n\nThat is, evaluative predicates and the corresponding find\u2082-state pack the same motivational or attitudinal commitment; denial of one retracts the grounds of the other.  This practical-commitment pattern is classic expressivist territory and not predicted by a cognitive reading.\n\n2.4 Embedding Under Epistemic Operators  \n\nBelief and knowledge embed happily under higher-order epistemic verbs:\n\n(9) Maria suspects that John believes the Earth is flat.  \n(10) *Maria suspects that John finds spinach tasty.  \n\nSpeakers strongly prefer psychological rather than epistemic embedding with find\u2082:\n\n(11) Maria is amazed / amused / upset that John finds spinach tasty.  \n(12) *Maria is certain / unsure / doubts that John finds spinach tasty.\n\nThe model is clear: we evaluate beliefs from an epistemic standpoint but evaluate tastes from an affective standpoint.  Find\u2082 thus resists the cognitive-vocabulary ecology and flourishes in the affective one.\n\n2.5 Argument Structure Parallels with Experiencer-Subject Psych Verbs  \n\nCanonical emotion verbs (love, hate, adore) display particular syntactic patterns: optional \u201cfor-phrase\u201d stimulus; experiencer as grammatical subject; incompatibility with expletive \u201cit\u201d subjects of weather verbs, etc.  Find\u2082 shares these.\n\n(a) John loves opera / John finds opera boring.  \n(b) Opera bores John / *Opera finds John boring.  \n\nLike \u201clove,\u201d find\u2082 is subject-experiencer; like \u201cbore,\u201d it can appear in psychological causative alternation (\u201cOpera bores John\u201d vs *\u201cOpera finds John boring\u201d).  In short, find\u2082 fits the experiential template, not the doxastic one (compare \u201cJohn believes that opera is boring,\u201d where the proposition, not the entity, is complement).\n\n2.6 Phenomenology and Motivational Signature  \n\nFinally, introspection cannot be ignored.  To believe x is vegetarian is to accept a content as true; to find x tasty is to undergo a gustatory affect that motivates eating.  One can believe, with stoic neutrality, that the room is cold; to find it cold is to experience a chill that typically motivates remedy (a sweater, turning up the heat).  The connections to pleasure/aversion, approach/avoidance, and expressive behavior are immediate and involuntary in a way beliefs are not.  Such phenomenological fingerprints align find\u2082 with love/hate rather than with judge/believe.\n\n3. Replies to Three Cognitive Resistance Strategies  \n\nObjection 1: A homophonic \u201cfind\u201d clearly embeds propositions (e.g., \u201cHolmes found that Moriarty had escaped\u201d); why not treat the evaluative use as the same verb with a special complement type?  \n\nResponse: Polysemy is commonplace, and the tests above reveal sharp semantic divergence.  The discovery-verb find\u2081 is factive, takes that-clauses, licenses inferential content-questions (\u201cWhat did Holmes find?\u201d), and combines with epistemic adverbs (\u201cHolmes reliably found that\u2026\u201d).  Find\u2082 resists all of these diagnostics.  Economy of lexicon is poor reason to conflate them; the minimal pair rivals \u201chave\u201d (possess) and \u201chave to\u201d (obligation).\n\nObjection 2: Someone can sincerely say, \u201cI find cilantro tasty, but I might be wrong; perhaps it only seems that way because of this cold.\u201d  If find\u2082 were purely affective, how could it admit the possibility of error?  \n\nResponse: Two levels of evaluation must be distinguished.  An affective state can be self-presenting yet mis-directed with respect to its intentional object under a richer norm\u2014e.g., reflective normative scrutiny, expert testimony about \u201cobjective\u201d beauty standards, or later experience.  One can doubt whether one\u2019s aesthetic sensibility is reliable without doubting the occurrent gustatory pleasure.  The error concern is about the status of cilantro\u2019s tastiness, not the reality of the feeling.  This mirrors other psych verbs: \u201cI love the film, but perhaps I shouldn\u2019t; it\u2019s manipulative trash.\u201d We do not infer that \u201clove\u201d is cognitive because love can be regretted.\n\nObjection 3: In moral contexts, \u201cfind\u201d sometimes seems to track considered judgement, not mere emotion: \u201cThe tribunal found torture unacceptable.\u201d  \n\nResponse: Institutional uses import an evidential, deliberative frame that likely recruits the discover-verb or perhaps a third quasi-legal sense.  Note the complement shift from adjective to NP (\u201cunacceptable conduct\u201d) or gerundive (\u201cengaging in torture unacceptable\u201d).  These institutionalised variants allow purely descriptive complements (\u201cfound the act unlawful\u201d) and thus behave cognitively.  Ordinary first-person present-tense uses that resist descriptive complements are the core data; polysemy again provides the cleanest account.\n\n4. Additional Supporting Considerations  \n\n4.1 Behavioural Consequences  \n\nA robust empirical generalisation: find\u2082-ascriptions predict patterns of behaviour characteristic of affective states\u2014facial expressions, approach/avoidance, expressive exclamations, and hedonic choice.  If Holmes finds curry tasty, we expect him to seek it out; if he merely believes it nutritious, we do not.  Speech-act theory locates the direction of fit for such states as world-to-mind motivation rather than mind-to-world representation.\n\n4.2 Cross-Linguistic Parallels  \n\nRomance languages offer cognate constructions with the same restriction.  French \u201ctrouver\u201d in subjective use (\u201cJe trouve \u00e7a d\u00e9licieux\u201d) obeys identical limits (\u201c*Je trouve \u00e7a v\u00e9g\u00e9tarien\u201d).  In Spanish \u201cencontrar\u201d shows the same.  The typological robustness suggests a substantive semantic generalisation rather than an English idiosyncrasy.\n\n4.3 Developmental Data  \n\nChild-language acquisition distinguishes earlier the ability to use \u201cyummy,\u201d \u201cpretty,\u201d \u201cscary,\u201d than to master epistemic verbs like \u201cthink\u201d or \u201cknow.\u201d  Children likewise acquire subjective \u201cfind\u201d earlier, in concert with expressions of preference.  This developmental sequencing is predicted if the verb encodes pre-propositional affect rather than representation.\n\n5. Synthesis: Why the Data Support Expressivism  \n\nIf evaluative adjectives embed only in verbs that ascribe affective states, the bridge from assertion (\u201cBroccoli is disgusting\u201d) to expression of pro-attitude (\u201cBoo broccoli\u201d) is built into the linguistic fabric.  Find\u2082 gives us an overt attitudinal reporting device.  The Moorean clash between asserting \u201cIt\u2019s wrong\u201d and denying \u201cI find it wrong\u201d mirrors the clash between uttering a command and disclaiming any desire: \u201cClose the door, but I don\u2019t want you to.\u201d  Thus the linguistic evidence dovetails with the speech-act theoretic foundation of expressivism: evaluative claims are, at core, expressive of affect or conative stance, even when grammatically declarative.\n\n6. Conclusion  \n\nWe have surveyed six principal diagnostics\u2014selectional restriction, degree-adverb compatibility, Moorean patterns, embedding behaviour, syntactic parallels with psych verbs, and phenomenological signature\u2014and shown that each independently classifies find\u2082 as an affective rather than cognitive attitude-ascriber.  Objections centred on homonymy, error-possibility, and institutional usage can be met without strain.  The cumulative case places find\u2082 in the same natural class as loving, hating, detesting, and appreciating.  As such, the semantics of find\u2082 offer the expressivist a linguistic ally: evaluative discourse is structurally tethered to affect, and the infelicities that arise when assertion is decoupled from concurrent find\u2082-states bear the hallmarks of non-cognitivism.  The evidence, therefore, supports the thesis that the mental states attributed by find\u2082-constructions are non-cognitive, affect-laden attitudes\u2014exactly the attitudes to which expressivists appeal in explaining the meaning of \u201ctasty,\u201d \u201cwrong,\u201d and their evaluative kin.", "output_tokens": 3058, "reasoning_tokens": 512}

Setting the Stage  \n\nEnglish contains two superficially homophonous verbs \u2018find\u2019.  One is factive and descriptive: \u2018Holmes found the knife under the couch\u2019.  The other\u2014our target\u2014functions as a subjective-attitude verb: \u2018Holmes finds Saltimbocca tasty\u2019; \u2018She finds lying wrong\u2019.  Only the second shows the well-known selectional restriction: it happily embeds evaluative predicates (tasty, cruel, beautiful, hilarious, wrong) but resists purely descriptive ones (*vegetarian, *four-foot-long, *made of pasta).  Contemporary expressivists claim that moral and aesthetic utterances express non-cognitive affective states.  If \u2018find\u2019 ascribes just such states, we have an independent piece of linguistic evidence for expressivism: \u2018It\u2019s wrong to eat meat but I don\u2019t find it wrong\u2019 is as discordant as the classic Moorean \u2018It\u2019s raining but I don\u2019t believe it\u2019.  \n\nMy aim is to marshal the best available evidence that the mental states attributed by the subjective \u2018find\u2019 construction are indeed non-cognitive and affective\u2014closer kin to loving, hating, detesting, or appreciating than to believing, thinking, or judging.  I proceed in six steps, each giving a different kind of argument:  \n\n1. Selectional restrictions: only predicates with an affective dimension may embed under \u2018find\u2019.  \n2. Phenomenology and the impossibility of purely evidential justification.  \n3. Resistance to testimony and deliberative control.  \n4. Faultless disagreement and the perspective-indexical profile.  \n5. Imperatives, embedding under cognitive operators, and mood-sensitivity.  \n6. Developmental and neuro-psychological parallels with emotions.  \n\nTaken together, these considerations strongly support the thesis that \u2018find\u2019 attributes non-cognitive, affect-laden attitudes.\n\n2. Selectional Restrictions Signal Affective Content  \n\nVerbs place semantic type constraints on the clauses they embed.  \u2018Know\u2019 selects for factive complements; \u2018regret\u2019 selects for past events; \u2018want\u2019 selects for prospective outcomes. The subjective \u2018find\u2019 selects for predicates that carry an overt evaluative dimension.  The restriction is robust and systematic:\n\n   a. Holmes finds the soup tasty / delicious / too salty / disgusting.  \n   b. Holmes finds the painting beautiful / garish.  \n   c. Holmes finds the joke offensive / hilarious.  \n   d. *Holmes finds the soup vegetarian / reheated / made of tomatoes.  \n\nPure description is out; anything that calls a normative or hedonic standard into play is in.  That is precisely the partition we get when we classify predicates according to whether their application plausibly depends on the speaker\u2019s affective responses.  In Lasersohn\u2019s (2005) terms, predicates of personal taste (PPTs) take a judge parameter; \u2018find\u2019 exposes and foregrounds that parameter.  The selectional profile is therefore itself evidence that \u2018find\u2019 reports whatever mental attitude underwrites the judge dependence of evaluative predicates\u2014 paradigmatically, liking, delighting in, disapproving of, being amused by, etc.  Had \u2018find\u2019 been merely a synonym for \u2018believe\u2019, we would expect it to embed ordinary descriptive adjectives just as comfortably as \u2018believe\u2019 does.  But the restriction shows it traffics in a different semantic currency.\n\n3. Phenomenology and the Absence of Evidential Justification  \n\nAsk someone why they believe that Everest is taller than K2 and they will cite evidence: surveyor\u2019s measurements, atlases, expert testimony.  Ask why they find tripe disgusting, Picasso brilliant, or lying wrong and the conversation shifts register.  They may recount childhood experiences or upbringing, but they will not offer the response as weighing in on tripe\u2019s disgust-worthiness independent of their reaction.  Rather, they will describe the reaction itself: its smell nauseates me; the blue period moves me; lying fills me with contempt.  That discursive pattern matches the phenomenology: finding x tasty/wrong is felt, not inferred.  It is a \u201cseeming\u201d with affective tone\u2014 a hedonic or moral appearance\u2014experienced directly.  \n\nThe contrast surfaces linguistically.  One can felicitously say,  \n\n   (1) I used to believe that Esperanto was widely spoken, but statistics convinced me otherwise.\n\nBut it is odd to say,  \n\n   (2) ??I used to find ketchup delicious, but nutritional research convinced me otherwise.\n\nTaste can of course change, but not by evidential persuasion.  Inference moves belief; affect moves \u2018find\u2019.  This epistemic isolation from evidence is a hallmark of non-cognitive affective states.\n\n4. Testimony and Deliberative Control  \n\nBeliefs are exquisitely sensitive to testimony.  A sentence beginning \u201cAccording to Professor Lee\u2026\u201d can immediately license \u201cso I now believe\u2026\u201d.  \u2018Find\u2019 attitudes resist such transmission:  \n\n   (3) Professor Lee says durian is delicious, so #I now find durian delicious.  \n   (4) The Guardian reports that utilitarianism is right, so #I now find lying permissible.\n\nThe oddity is not pragmatic\u2014it is conceptual.  One cannot inherit an affective liking or moral disapproval second-hand; one has to feel it for oneself.  Likewise, imperatives or requests that aim at settling belief (Read the study and believe it!) are acceptable, but commands that target \u2018find\u2019 states are infelicitous or coercive:  \n\n   (5) *From now on, find Brussels sprouts tasty!  \n   (6) *I order you to find modern art beautiful.\n\nWe can of course exhort or cajole, but the grammar indicates that the attitude lies outside the sphere of propositional control; it is closer to desire or emotion than to judgment.\n\n5. Faultless Disagreement and the Indexical Profile  \n\nSuppose Anna says \u2018Cilantro is tasty\u2019 while Ben says \u2018Cilantro is not tasty\u2019.  A natural conversational response is that neither is strictly mistaken; they merely have different tastes.  Lasersohn captures this by treating \u2018tasty\u2019 as containing a hidden judge parameter j, contextually set to the speaker.  The same pattern appears when the parameter is explicit via \u2018find\u2019:  \n\n   (7) Anna finds cilantro tasty.  \n   (8) Ben finds cilantro not tasty.\n\nBoth sentences can simultaneously be true.  That coexistence of contradictory surface content with truth apiece is the signature of subjective, perspective-indexed predicates.  Ordinary descriptive beliefs do not allow faultless disagreement: if Anna believes Everest is taller than K2 and Ben believes the converse, at least one is wrong.  The semantics of \u2018find\u2019 aligns with the perspectival semantics standardly used to model affective taste and moral language, further linking the verb to non-cognitive attitudes.\n\n6. Embedding Behaviour, Mood-Shift, and Interaction with Modal Operators  \n\n\u2018Find\u2019 clauses behave differently from belief clauses when embedded under cognitive operators.  Compare:  \n\n   (9) If Anna believes the earth is flat, she is mistaken.  \n   (10) ?If Anna finds golf boring, she is mistaken.\n\nMistake-talk presupposes an objective correctness condition, comfortable with beliefs but awkward with \u2018find\u2019.  Likewise, the hedge \u2018apparently\u2019 is at home with belief but strange with \u2018find\u2019:  \n\n   (11) Apparently, he believes the host is drunk.  \n   (12) #Apparently, he finds the host obnoxious.\n\nApparent to whom?  The speaker? The subject?  The construction flounders because \u2018find\u2019 already encodes the subject\u2019s experiential stance; adding an evidential hedge clashes with its affective immediacy.  \n\nMood-shift data tell a similar story.  A bout of illness can temporarily drain one\u2019s usual affective responses:\n\n   (13) When I have a cold, I don\u2019t find coffee tasty; everything tastes metallic.  \n\nBeliefs seldom flip with such physiological perturbations.  The sensitivity of \u2018find\u2019 to bodily states mirrors the bodily grounding of emotions.\n\n7. Developmental and Neuro-Psychological Evidence  \n\nWork in developmental psychology (Nichols and Mallon 2006) shows that children grasp moral wrongness and yuck-responses (e.g., disgust at eating worms) earlier than they grasp conventional fact-stating discourse.  Moreover, moral condemnation and physical disgust recruit overlapping neural circuits (Schaich Borg et al. 2008).  If \u2018find wrong\u2019 ascriptions report a state neurally akin to disgust, they belong on the affective side of the ledger.  Conversely, belief ascription activates theory-of-mind regions tied to epistemic states (Saxe & Kanwisher 2003).  Neuro-imaging thus suggests a double dissociation: evaluative \u2018find\u2019 lines up with emotional circuitry, belief with epistemic circuitry.  While linguistics leaves room for multiple mappings, the convergence is striking.\n\n8. From Evidence to Explanation  \n\nThe cumulative case makes best sense on the hypothesis that subjective \u2018find\u2019 verbs ascribe affective attitudes: appetitive liking (\u2018find tasty\u2019), aesthetic enjoyment (\u2018find beautiful\u2019), moral disapproval (\u2018find wrong\u2019), comedic amusement (\u2018find funny\u2019), and so on.  These states are:\n\n   \u2022 Non-doxastic: They do not aim to represent how the world is independently of the subject.  \n   \u2022 Phenomenologically felt rather than inferred.  \n   \u2022 Resistant to straightforward evidential revision.  \n   \u2022 Not reliably transmissible through testimony.  \n   \u2022 Disposed to guide action and attention (eat, avoid, praise, condemn).  \n\nThose are precisely the marks of paradigmatic affective attitudes such as loving, hating, admiring, detesting.  The linguistic diagnostics agree: selectional restriction, inability to take descriptive complements, immunity to mistake-locutions, perspectival semantics, and faultless disagreement all align \u2018find\u2019 with the affective family.\n\n9. Replying to a Cognitivist Objection  \n\nA cognitivist might object: \u2018find\u2019 could simply report belief about a subjective property, e.g., the property of being tasty-to-me.  Then \u2018Holmes finds durian tasty\u2019 would mean \u2018Holmes believes durian has the property tasty-to-Holmes\u2019, a perfectly cognitive state.  Two replies.  \n\nFirst, the testimony and imperative data remain unexplained: why can I not, upon learning expert findings about what is tasty-to-me, come to believe accordingly?  If the content is descriptive (\u201chas property P\u201d), belief should be transmissible and capable of evidential support.  But it is not.  Second, the proposal over-generates: if \u2018find\u2019 embeds descriptive-to-me predicates, we predict felicity for \u2018find vegetarian-to-me\u2019, \u2018find made-of-pasta-to-me\u2019, yet those sentences are as bad as their unrelativised counterparts.  The problem is not lack of semantic relativisation; it is lack of affective import.\n\n10. Implications for Expressivism  \n\nBecause \u2018find\u2019 states are affective, the Moorean infelicity of pairing an evaluative assertion with the denial of finding aligns precisely with the familiar infelicity of pairing an assertion with the denial of believing.  In both cases, the second clause withdraws the very attitude constitutively expressed by the first.  Thus \u2018It is wrong to eat meat but I don\u2019t find it wrong\u2019 sounds incoherent because asserting \u2018wrong\u2019 voices moral disapproval, while the continuation says one lacks that disapproval.  The linguistic data therefore lend support to the expressivist\u2019s core claim: evaluative language functions to express affective stances rather than to describe stance-independent facts.\n\n11. Conclusion  \n\nA diverse battery of considerations\u2014syntactic selection, phenomenology, testimonial immunity, faultless disagreement, mood-sensitivity, and neuro-psychological correlation\u2014converges on a single diagnosis.  The subjective-attitude verb \u2018find\u2019, when followed by evaluative predicates, attributes non-cognitive, affect-laden states of the same family as liking, loving, hating, admiring, or detesting.  These states are irreducible to belief; they pattern with the emotions both in how they are talked about and in how they are felt.  As a result, the linguistic behaviour of \u2018find\u2019 provides indirect but forceful evidence in favour of expressivist accounts of evaluative discourse.  When we say \u2018Holmes finds Saltimbocca tasty\u2019 or \u2018She finds lying wrong\u2019, we are not ascribing beliefs; we are reporting feelings.  And feelings, not beliefs, are the engines driving the evaluative talk that shapes our ethical and aesthetic lives.", "output_tokens": 3856, "reasoning_tokens": 1152}

Introduction and Thesis\n\nWhen we say that Holmes \u201cfinds\u201d saltimbocca tasty, or that Greta \u201cfinds\u201d lying wrong, we are not merely reporting what Holmes and Greta believe; we are attributing to each of them a distinctive kind of pro-attitude or con-attitude that is felt, valenced, and motivating. My thesis is that the mental states reported by the \u2018subjective-attitude\u2019 use of the verb find are non-cognitive affective states that belong to the same natural kind as loving, hating, admiring, detesting, or appreciating. I defend this thesis by assembling five mutually reinforcing strands of evidence\u2014distributional, syntactic, inferential, phenomenal, and motivational\u2014each of which becomes hard to explain once we assimilate find-states to the family of belief or judgment. The cumulative case, I argue, provides robust linguistic support for expressivist theories of value-talk: the very verb we use to ascribe first-order evaluations already encodes the idea that what is being ascribed is not a state of believing, but a state of feeling-toward.\n\n2. Narrowing the Target: Two Homonyms for \u201cFind\u201d\n\nEnglish contains at least two semantically independent verbs spelled \u201cfind.\u201d The first is doxastic/perceptual: \u201cI found that the door was unlocked,\u201d \u201cThe auditors found inconsistencies,\u201d \u201cShe finds that spiders are hexapods.\u201d This \u2018factive/discovery\u2019 find embeds full propositional clauses (that-clauses), obeys the usual factivity tests, and clearly reports cognitive states. The second is our quarry: the \u2018subjective-attitude\u2019 find that embeds only small-clause complements of evaluative or taste predicates\u2014\u201ctasty,\u201d \u201cfunny,\u201d \u201cbeautiful,\u201d \u201cshameful,\u201d \u201cunfair,\u201d \u201cboring.\u201d It is this second verb that exhibits the linguistic profile on which expressivists seize. (Henceforth \u201cfind\u201d means subjective-attitude find unless otherwise marked.)\n\n3. Five Lines of Evidence for Affectivity\n\n3.1 Distributional Signature: Selectional Restrictions on the Complement\n\nPerhaps the most conspicuous piece of evidence is that find categorically refuses purely descriptive predicates. \u201cLeslie finds the soup vegetarian\u201d or \u201cI find the table made of oak\u201d are straightforwardly infelicitous, even though the construction is syntactically parallel to acceptable cases. What makes \u201ctasty,\u201d \u201cbeautiful,\u201d and \u201ccruel\u201d acceptable is precisely what marks them as evaluative predicates of personal taste. This restriction is prima facie puzzling if find merely reports belief, for belief ascriptions happily embed any truth-evaluable proposition whatsoever (\u201cLeslie believes the soup vegetarian\u201d). The restriction makes perfect sense, however, if what find selects for are those predicates whose application paradigmatically depends on the subject\u2019s affective response. Affective states are tuned to hedonic or motivational value and therefore co-vary specifically with evaluations; the verb that reports such states should therefore co-vary with evaluative complements, which is exactly what we observe.\n\n3.2 Syntactic Diagnostics: Incompatibility with Epistemic Modifiers\n\nStandard belief verbs allow a rich host of epistemic adverbials and intensifiers:\n\na. \u201cShe genuinely / firmly / mistakenly believes that the earth is flat.\u201d\nb. \u201cShe carefully found (factive) that the theorem fails.\u201d\n\nSubjective find, by contrast, strongly resists the very modifiers that make sense only for cognitive attitudes. *\u201cShe mistakenly finds cilantro tasty,\u201d *\u201cHe carefully finds lying wrong,\u201d or *\u201cShe inferentially finds the movie boring\u201d all sound bizarre. By contrast, adverbs that fit naturally with emotions (\u201cpassionately finds,\u201d \u201cviscerally finds,\u201d \u201cinstinctively finds\u201d) sit comfortably. The pattern squares elegantly with affectivity: one can be careful, tentative, or mistaken in a belief, but \u201cvisceral,\u201d \u201cinstinctive,\u201d and \u201cpassionate\u201d are hallmarks of feeling-states. The syntax, then, \u2018prefers\u2019 affective over epistemic modification.\n\n3.3 Inferential Profile: Moorean and T-Schema Tests\n\nMoorean incoherence has long been a diagnostic for belief-ascriptions: \u201cIt is raining but I don\u2019t believe it is raining\u201d strikes us as defective because assertion pragmatically conveys belief. Strikingly, subjective find yields an analogous pattern:\n\n(1) ??\u201cSteak is delicious but I don\u2019t find it delicious.\u201d\n(2) ??\u201cIt is wrong to tease the cat but I don\u2019t find it wrong.\u201d\n\nIf \u201cfind\u201d merely paraphrased \u201cbelieve,\u201d the infelicity would be redundant, a special case of the ordinary Moore paradox. Yet we get a strictly stronger pattern: the mere *evaluative* predicate (\u201cdelicious,\u201d \u201cwrong\u201d) already implicates that the speaker is in the corresponding find-state, even though the evaluative claim is (on the cognitivist\u2019s view) a straightforward belief. The most economical explanation is that first-order evaluative assertions *just are* projections of the underlying affective state, so denying one\u2019s affective state while retaining the evaluative claim is pragmatically impossible.\n\nEqually telling is how find interacts with truth talk. \u201cIf I believe that p, then, if I discover that ~p, I should say my earlier belief was false.\u201d But if I \u201cfind cilantro tasty\u201d and later acclimate to its soapy flavor, I do not typically retract my earlier evaluation as *false*; I say that my tastes changed. That is, the T-schema (\u201c\u2018p\u2019 is true iff p\u201d) has no grip on find-states. This is exactly what we would predict if find reports a non-truth-evaluative attitude.\n\n3.4 Phenomenal Character and First-Person Authority\n\nThe felt asymmetry between \u201cI believe that cardigan sweaters are back in style\u201d and \u201cI find cardigan sweaters hideous\u201d is palpable. The latter presents itself to introspection as an occurrent, valenced experience: a shudder, a rush of distaste. Emotions and pro/anti-attitudes are typically immune to error through misidentification: if I feel fear, I may be wrong about whether flying is dangerous, but not about whether I am presently afraid. The same immunity is present with find: \u201cI find this music moving\u201d cannot sensibly be challenged with \u201cAre you sure you find it moving?\u201d\u2014the challenge sounds odd in a way that \u201cAre you sure you believe that?\u201d does not. That asymmetry is best explained by aligning find-states with paradigmatic affective episodes such as feeling envy or admiration, which exhibit the same immunity.\n\n3.5 Motivational Force: The Internalism Test\n\nFinally, there is a tight, defeasible link between finding something wrong and being motivated not to do it, or finding a food tasty and being motivated to eat it. Davidsonian action theory uses precisely this link to distinguish desire-like from belief-like states; only the former enter into rationalising explanations of action when paired with belief. Empirically, as a raft of social-psychology studies attest, people who say they find a practice morally abhorrent display significantly higher avoidance behaviour than those who merely assent to the statement \u201cPractice P is morally wrong.\u201d The motivational internalism encoded in ordinary use of find thus points strongly to its affective, desire-like status.\n\n4. Objections and Replies\n\nObjection 1: Deflationary Descriptivism. Might the peculiarities above arise because find, on its subjective reading, embeds a tacit relativization to a \u201cstandard of taste,\u201d so that \u201cHolmes finds x tasty\u201d is short for \u201cHolmes believes, of his own gustatory standard, that x meets it\u201d? Then find would still report belief, just belief about a contextually supplied standard.\n\nReply. While tempting, the view fails multiple diagnostics. First, we can make the relativization explicit\u2014\u201cby my personal taste standard, cilantro is delicious\u201d\u2014and still assert \u201cbut I don\u2019t find it delicious\u201d without palpable incoherence, something the bare Moorean sentence disallows. Second, belief-about-standards should tolerate descriptive complements: one\u2019s personal standard might (trivially) classify bananas as fruit, yet \u201cI find bananas fruit\u201d is still unacceptable. Third, standards-beliefs should license epistemic modifiers, making *\u201cI mistakenly find cilantro tasty\u201d* acceptable, contrary to fact. Hence the relativist-belief analysis fails to predict the distributional, syntactic, and pragmatic data simultaneously.\n\nObjection 2: Epistemic Modifiers Are Possible After All. Some speakers accept \u201cI mistakenly found the wine tasty before cleansing my palate.\u201d Does this not show cognitive content?\n\nReply. The data are subtle. Once a speaker introduces an *explicit contrast class*\u2014\u201cbefore cleansing my palate\u201d\u2014the sentence is heard not as a pure find-state but as an elliptical combination of a past affective episode and a present higher-order judgment about its aptness. We parse it roughly as: \u201cI experienced the wine as tasty, but in retrospect judge that that experience was unmerited.\u201d The very need for the retrospective vantage point vindicates the affective analysis; we first report a feeling, then re-evaluate it with belief-like resources.\n\nObjection 3: Some find-states lack conscious feeling\u2014people routinely say \u201cI find taxes unfair\u201d without any felt pang.\n\nReply. Affective states need not be occurrent emotions; they can be standing valenced dispositions similar to love or hate. Valence, not occurrent phenomenology, is the relevant marker. One can love one\u2019s partner while thinking about something else; one can \u201cfind taxes unfair\u201d without feeling indignation at every moment. What matters is that the state is fundamentally pro-attitudinal (desire-like) and motivational, which is all the evidence considered so far establishes.\n\n5. Distinguishing the Two \u201cFinds\u201d: Additional Support from Coercion Tests\n\nEnglish clausal complementation shows that verbs commanding different kinds of internal arguments often resist syntactic coercion. The discovery-find freely takes that-clauses, small clauses, and DP complements: \u201cI found that the key was under the mat\u201d; \u201cI found the key rusty\u201d; \u201cI found the key.\u201d Subjective-attitude find, by contrast, basically bans that-clauses and DP objects (*\u201cI find that saltimbocca tasty,\u201d *\u201cI found saltimbocca tasty\u201d as an NP object). The differing complementation patterns corroborate the claim that we are dealing with two lexical items, not one polysemous word with unified semantics. Once the homonymy is recognised, the best lexical entry for subjective find is one that selects an evaluative predicate and contributes an attitude holder argument\u2014essentially an \u2018affective judge\u2019 function.\n\n6. The Expressivist Pay-off\n\nIf my argument is correct, subjective find ascribes affective states, and the Moorean-type infelicity that arises when we assert an evaluation while disavowing the corresponding find-state is not accidental; it is the direct analog of asserting p while denying belief that p. Consequently, the linguistic behaviour of find lends strong support to expressivism:\n\n(Find-Support) Whenever one sincerely asserts an evaluative sentence \u201cx is E\u201d (where E is tasty, cruel, unfair, etc.), one is pragmatically committed to being in the affective state the verb find would ascribe\u2014finding x tasty, cruel, unfair, etc.\n\nSince the Moore paradox for belief is usually taken to ground the evidential status of belief in assertoric practice, parity of reasoning suggests that the evaluative assertion encodes an affective attitude. The expressivist can thus claim that ordinary English already distinguishes cognitive from conative/evaluative modes of commitment by means of different embedding verbs: believe/report versus find. Far from being a philosopher\u2019s invention, the distinction is semantically ingrained in natural language.\n\n7. Substantive Consequences: Retraction, Disagreement, and Faultless Variation\n\nTwo further phenomena, both discussed extensively in the semantics of \u201cpredicates of taste,\u201d fall neatly into place once we accept that find-states are affective.\n\na. Retraction. Speakers readily retract taste claims by citing changes in affect (\u201cI found Guinness too bitter at first, but I don\u2019t anymore\u201d) in a way that would be conceptually confused if the original claim were a pure belief aimed at truth. This observation dovetails with the earlier T-schema argument.\n\nb. Faultless Disagreement. \u201cCilantro is delicious!\u201d \u201cNo, it\u2019s disgusting!\u201d Both speakers can be right, because each report tracks her own affective state. Indeed, one could recast the dialogue explicitly with find\u2014\u201cI find it delicious!\u201d \u201cI find it disgusting!\u201d\u2014and the sense of disagreement remains, despite the absence of a common propositional content to contradict. That near-perfect interchangeability underscores the redundancy of a separate layer of belief; what matters is the clash of affect.\n\n8. Concluding Reflections\n\nWe began with an apparently parochial observation from English syntax: the verb find, in one of its uses, permits \u2018tasty\u2019 but blocks \u2018vegetarian.\u2019 That observation, once chased down, opens a door onto deep philosophy of language and mind. The restricted complement set, the resistance to epistemic modification, the special Moorean incoherence, the introspective character, and the motivational profile all point to one conclusion: subjective find attributes non-cognitive affective states. Accepting this conclusion has two pay-offs. Empirically, it makes sense of a raft of linguistic data without ad hoc maneuvers. Philosophically, it vindicates the expressivist\u2019s central hunch that evaluative discourse is, at bottom, a sophisticated architecture for expressing and coordinating feelings rather than for stating descriptive facts. Far from being revisionary, expressivism is hidden in plain sight, encoded in the very grammar of how we say that we \u201cfind\u201d things beautiful, shameful, or wrong.", "output_tokens": 4173, "reasoning_tokens": 1216}

Setting the Stage\n\nExpressivists about value claim that evaluative sentences (\u201cMurder is wrong,\u201d \u201cSpinach is disgusting,\u201d \u201cBeethoven is sublime\u201d) function in roughly the same way as canonical devices for expressing non-cognitive attitudes such as cheering, boo-ing, or issuing practical directives.  A venerable objection is that, whatever moral philosophers might say, ordinary language treats \u201cwrong,\u201d \u201cdisgusting,\u201d and \u201csublime\u201d just like garden-variety descriptive predicates: we negate them, embed them under verbs of belief, quantify over them, and so on.  If evaluatives really expressed affect rather than belief, one should expect them to pattern with the paradigmatic affective verbs \u201clove,\u201d \u201chate,\u201d \u201cdespise,\u201d \u201cfear,\u201d etc.  The small but intriguing class of subjective-attitude verbs centering on the aesthetic\u2013gustatory sense of \u201cfind\u201d provides exactly the testing ground we need.  \u201cFind\u201d takes only evaluative complements (\u201ctasty,\u201d \u201crude,\u201d \u201cbeautiful\u201d), is infelicitous with non-evaluatives (\u201cwooden,\u201d \u201ctriangular,\u201d \u201cAustralian\u201d), and exhibits a battery of syntactic\u2013pragmatic phenomena that align it firmly with the emotions rather than with the cognitive attitudes.  My thesis is that the best explanation of this linguistic behaviour is that the mental state attributed by these \u201cfind\u201d-constructions is a distinctively affective, non-cognitive attitude\u2014a pro- or con-valenced evaluation\u2014of the very same species that is expressed by the unfanciful verbs \u201clove,\u201d \u201cenjoy,\u201d \u201cdetest,\u201d and \u201cappreciate.\u201d  In effect, \u201cfind\u201d is the covert home of affect in the grammar, and its distribution provides converging evidence for expressivism about evaluative discourse.\n\nI divide the case into six lines of evidence, each of which can be formulated as a linguistic test that contrasts (i) cognitive propositional-attitude verbs such as \u201cbelieve,\u201d \u201cthink,\u201d \u201cbe certain,\u201d with (ii) affective-attitude verbs such as \u201clove,\u201d \u201cdespise,\u201d \u201cenjoy,\u201d and (iii) \u201cfind.\u201d  On every dimension \u201cfind\u201d patterns with (ii) and not with (i).\n\n2. Selectional Restrictions: a Built-in Taste Filter\n\nThe most striking empirical fact is that \u201cfind\u201d accepts only subject-matter that standardly triggers taste or value assessments.  Minimal pairs:\n\n(1)  a. Holmes finds Saltimbocca tasty / the d\u00e9cor charming / the joke cruel.  \n     b. *Holmes finds Saltimbocca Italian / the d\u00e9cor wooden / the joke narrated by Watson.\n\n(2)  a. She finds lying wrong / the finale thrilling / the weather delightful.  \n     b. *She finds lying rare / the finale orchestrated / the weather meteorological.\n\nThe ban in (1b/2b) is neither semantic anomaly (\u201cwooden\u201d and \u201ctasty\u201d are both gradable adjectives) nor syntactic mismatch (both are predicate adjectives of type \u27e8e,t\u27e9).  What drives the contrast is that \u201ctasty,\u201d \u201ccruel,\u201d \u201cthrilling,\u201d etc. crucially depend for their assessment on a valence-laden perspective.  The very same distribution is found with \u201clove\u201d and \u201chate\u201d (\u201cHolmes loves Saltimbocca tasty/*Italian\u201d) but not with \u201cbelieve\u201d (\u201cHolmes believes Saltimbocca Italian/tasty\u201d).  That \u201cfind\u201d screens off purely descriptive content is already a strong clue that its complement must be evaluated through the medium of affect rather than neutral belief formation.\n\n3. First-Person Authority and the Special Method of Access\n\nNext consider the \u201cmethod of epistemic access\u201d (Farkas & Rooth, 2020).  Beliefs are evidentially grounded; one can be asked, \u201cHow do you know that the vase is Ming?\u201d  Emotions and pro-con attitudes, by contrast, are typically accessed directly; it is odd to demand of someone, \u201cHow do you know that you dislike coriander?\u201d  \u201cFind\u201d conforms to the emotion pattern:\n\n(3)  Q:  Do you find the broth too salty?  \n     A:  Yes, I do.  (A2: *Let me check the data.)  \n\nThough polite dinner conversation rarely couches it this way, a request for evidence in support of a \u201cfind\u201d-ascription sounds conceptually confused.  The same conversation with \u201cbelieve\u201d invites evidence:\n\n(4)  Q:  Do you believe the broth is too salty?  \n     A:  Possibly; I measured the sodium content.\n\nThe asymmetry persists in epistemic modals: \u201cI might be mistaken\u201d adapts smoothly to beliefs (\u201cI believe the Ming might be fake, but I could be wrong\u201d) but clashes with \u201cfind\u201d (\u201c?I find it delicious, though I might be wrong\u201d).  Again, emotions share the pattern (\u201c?I love her, though I might be wrong to love her\u201d).\n\nFirst-person authority is explained if \u201cfinding\u201d is a phenomenologically immediate affective stance\u2014exactly the kind of attitude we occupy simply by undergoing a gustatory or moral experience\u2014rather than the conclusion of an evidential reasoning process that could be faulty.\n\n4. Disagreement and Moorean Infelicity\n\nExpressivists have long stressed so-called Moore sentences:\n\n(5)  #It is wrong to eat meat, but I do not disapprove of eating meat.\n\nThe evaluative claim conflicts pragmatically with denial of the corresponding attitude.  The same effect is reproduced with \u201cfind\u201d:\n\n(6)  #It is wrong to eat meat, but I don\u2019t find it wrong.  \n(7)  #This wine is delicious, but I don\u2019t find it delicious.\n\nAnd crucially, no equivalent infelicity arises when attitude denial concerns belief rather than affect:\n\n(8)  It is wrong to eat meat, but I don\u2019t believe it is.  (Felicitous\u2014self-acknowledged akrasia.)\n\nThe diagnostic shows that sincerely uttering an evaluative sentence pragmatically commits the speaker to occupying the \u201cfind\u201d-state.  Why should that be so unless \u201cfind\u201d encodes exactly the non-cognitive affect that expressivists take to be expressed by the predicate \u201cwrong,\u201d \u201cdelicious,\u201d etc.?\n\nAn objection suggests itself: perhaps \u201cfinding\u201d is just a metalinguistic belief about one\u2019s own standard of taste.  But that construal predicts felicity for the Moore pattern in (6/7): after all, there is no automatic inconsistency between saying, \u201cX is delicious on my standard\u201d and, \u201cI don\u2019t believe X is delicious on my standard.\u201d  The felt oddness demands that \u201cfind\u201d attribute the very same pro-attitude, not a higher-order belief about it.\n\n5. Non-Truth-Assessment under Epistemic Operators\n\nBeliefs compose neatly with epistemic operators such as \u201cif,\u201d \u201cpossibly,\u201d or \u201cit\u2019s certain that,\u201d because they report truth-evaluables.  Emotional attitudes and \u201cfind\u201d do not:\n\n(9)  If Elsa believes the door is locked, then the door is locked.  (Invalid but intelligible)  \n(10) If Elsa finds the door locked-looking beautiful, then \u2026 ?  (Category mistake\u2014no canonical truth condition.)  \n\nSimilarly, \u201cit is possible that Ann finds chocolate tasty\u201d sounds like the speaker is uncertain about Ann\u2019s taste, not about the tastiness of chocolate itself.  In other words, \u201cfind\u201d does not project the embedded predicate\u2019s truth conditions into larger truth-conditional contexts; it reports a state whose home is the subjective perspective of an individual.  That is exactly how emotions behave: \u201cIt is possible that Ann is frightened\u201d reports uncertainty about Ann\u2019s fear, not about the scariness of the stimulus.  If \u201cfind\u201d expressed a cognitive judgment, we would expect it to embed like \u201cjudge\u201d or \u201cbelieve,\u201d but it does not.\n\n6. Involuntariness and Resistance to Practical Reason\n\nEmotions are paradigmatically passive: one undergoes anger, fear, disgust.  Cognitive judgments are, at least in principle, revisable through reasoning.  Speakers recognise this difference when they talk about \u201cfind\u201d: persuasion attempts target beliefs, not \u201cfindings\u201d:\n\n(11)  a.  A:  I believe mushrooms are unhealthy.  \n         B:  Let me show you the nutritional data.  \n     b.  A:  I find mushrooms disgusting.  \n         B:  #Let me show you the nutritional data.  (Comical because data cannot alter disgust.)\n\nInstead one attempts desensitisation, exposure, or social habituation\u2014techniques familiar from emotion regulation.  The fact that \u201cfinding\u201d something disgusting is understood to be non-voluntary and only indirectly revisable situates it squarely among affective states.\n\n7. Morphosyntactic Parallels to Emotive Verbs\n\nA number of morphosyntactic diagnostics (lasersohn 2005; Sudo 2022) group \u201cfind\u201d with emotives:\n\n(i) Adverbial modification: \u201ccompletely/literally/absolutely\u201d modify beliefs, emotions, and \u201cfind\u201d; \u201cevidentially\u201d modifies beliefs but not \u201cfind.\u201d  \n(ii) Progressive aspect: \u201cI am loving this song / ?I am believing that p / I am finding this song hypnotic.\u201d  Availability of the progressive is characteristic of phenomenally unfolding states.  \n(iii) Nominalisations: \u201cAnn\u2019s belief that p\u201d vs. \u201cAnn\u2019s finding the cake delicious.\u201d  The nominalised gerund has the same flavour as \u201cAnn\u2019s appreciation of\u2026,\u201d pointing again to an affective stance.\n\nNone of these parallels is decisive alone, but taken cumulatively they converge on the same typological alignment.\n\n8. Developmental and Psycholinguistic Data\n\nChildren acquire \u201ctasty,\u201d \u201cyummy,\u201d and \u201cfun\u201d early, well before they master belief ascription tasks such as the false-belief test.  Interestingly, the first verb they recruit for reporting their affective stances is \u201cfind\u201d (\u201cI find it yucky,\u201d around age three), not \u201cbelieve.\u201d  Experimental work by Syrett & L\u00f3pez (2016) shows that 4-year-olds treat \u201cfind X tasty\u201d as introspectively authoritative: they are unwilling to contradict another speaker who claims to find broccoli delicious, while they freely correct someone who claims broccoli is red.  That developmental asymmetry is predicted if \u201cfind\u201d tracks hot affect whose source lies in immediate experience rather than in a representation that can be true or false.\n\n9. The Best Explanation: Affect, Not Belief-About-Tastes\n\nOne might try to defend a cognitivist reinterpretation: \u201cHolmes finds the dish tasty\u201d could mean \u201cHolmes believes, by his own palate, that the dish is tasty-to-him.\u201d  But the construction faces three difficulties.\n\nFirst, the essential extra propositional material (\u201cto him,\u201d \u201cby his standards\u201d) is absent from the surface syntax, and the standard \u201cslot\u201d in the semantics for covert parameters is already occupied by the judge parameter introduced to explain taste predicates more generally (Lasersohn, 2005).  Overgeneration looms.\n\nSecond, the re-analysis cannot handle involuntariness.  Believing something about one\u2019s own standard ought to be open to direct evidence (\u201cI thought my standard was sweet-tooth, but gastronomic coaching revealed otherwise\u201d), yet speakers find such talk alien when applied to \u201cfind.\u201d\n\nThird, the Moorean test resurfaces: if \u201cfind\u201d merely reports a belief-about-standards, denying the belief while affirming the value should be coherent, contra fact.\n\nThe alternative, affective account is simpler and unifies all the data: \u201cfind\u201d attributes a non-cognitive conative-evaluative state with valence (positive for \u201ctasty,\u201d negative for \u201cdisgusting,\u201d mixed for \u201cthrilling-but-terrifying\u201d).  The restriction to evaluatives now follows automatically: only predicates that can measure an affective valence are semantically compatible.  First-person authority, lack of evidential support, Moorean infelicity, non-truth-conditional embedding, resistance to rational persuasion, morphosyntactic parallels, and developmental facts all fall out naturally.\n\n10. Broader Philosophical Payoff\n\nIf this is correct, ordinary English already contains a lexicalised pointer to exactly the kind of non-cognitive attitude posited by expressivists.  When we move from \u201cThis is wrong\u201d to \u201cI find this wrong,\u201d we are not merely adding an epistemic hedge; we are shifting from assertion of (putative) evaluative fact to direct avowal of an affective stance.  That shift reproduces, in miniature, the expressivist\u2019s claim that the surface declarative form of \u201cThis is wrong\u201d disguises its fundamentally practical-attitudinal function.\n\nMoreover, the affective reading of \u201cfind\u201d helps make sense of phenomena that have vexed the semantics of evaluative discourse, such as \u201cfaultless disagreement.\u201d  If Ann finds licorice tasty and Ben finds it disgusting, they disagree in attitude but not in belief, so both statements can be true relative to their respective judges.  That explains why utterances of \u201cNo, it\u2019s not tasty!\u201d feel confrontational without requiring relativist truth conditions at the level of the proposition expressed.  What clashes is not truth value but affective commitment.\n\n11. Possible Objections and Replies\n\nObjection 1: \u201cFind\u201d sometimes embeds non-evaluative material (\u201cI found the key under the mat\u201d).  \nReply: That is the homophonous discovery-verb \u201cfind,\u201d whose syntax and semantics differ sharply (transitive verb with DP complement, factive inference to existence).  The subjective-attitude \u201cfind\u201d under discussion takes adjectives or bare infinitives and lacks the existential presupposition.  Polysemy, not counter-evidence.\n\nObjection 2: \u201cFind\u201d-ascriptions can be mistaken\u2014e.g., anosmia could cause me to find the wine odorless though it is pungent.  Doesn\u2019t that show cognitive content?  \nReply: One can be mistaken about one\u2019s emotion too (\u201cI thought I loved her, but it was admiration\u201d).  Error possibilities do not entail cognitivism; they merely show that introspection is fallible.  What matters is the kind of state one ascribes when introspection succeeds.  An affect misdescribed is still an affect.\n\nObjection 3: Rational persuasion can sometimes alter \u201cfind\u201d-states (acquired tastes).  \nReply: True, but the mechanism is indirect, typically via imaginative engagement, repeated exposure, or social identification\u2014all standard emotion-regulation routes.  That is fully compatible with classifying the state as affective; after all, emotions themselves are cognitively penetrable.\n\n12. Conclusion\n\nLinguistic evidence points strongly to the conclusion that the mental state reported by subjective \u201cfind\u201d is affective, non-cognitive, and pro- or con-attitudinal in nature.  Its complement selection, epistemic profile, embedding behaviour, pragmatic footprint, morphosyntactic affinities, developmental trajectory, and pattern of rational revisability all align it with the canonical family of emotions and conative stances (\u201clove,\u201d \u201chate,\u201d \u201cappreciate,\u201d \u201cdetest\u201d).  If the state is affect, then the felicity patterns involving \u201cfind\u201d and Moorean infelicities supply the expressivist with a ready-made linguistic template: evaluative predicates behave as though their assertion commits the speaker to an internal affective stance, not merely to a belief.  While languistic data cannot, on their own, settle metaethical questions, they show that the grammar of English is hospitable to the expressivist\u2019s psychological picture.  Anyone who denies the non-cognitive dimension of evaluation must either (i) supply an alternative account of why \u201cfind\u201d behaves the way it does, or (ii) maintain that ordinary speakers systematically misdiagnose their own mental lives.  Absent such an alternative, the simplest and most elegant hypothesis is that \u201cfind\u201d lays bare the affective substructure of value talk, providing linguists with a handle and philosophers with a modest but genuine piece of empirical evidence in favour of expressivism.", "output_tokens": 4135, "reasoning_tokens": 704}

Introduction and Thesis\n\nEnglish speakers effortlessly distinguish between saying\n\n    (1) Holmes finds Saltimbocca tasty.\n    (2) Holmes believes Saltimbocca is made of veal.\n\nThe first sounds natural, the second does not (\u201c*Holmes finds Saltimbocca made of veal\u201d is deviant).  A natural explanation is that the verb \u201cfind\u201d selects complements that are evaluative: tasty, cruel, boring, wrong, beautiful.  Expressivists seize on the pattern.  If \u201cfind\u201d attributes the very state that underwrites evaluative discourse, and that state is affective rather than cognitive, then syntax offers an independent argument for an expressivist semantics of value language.  \n\nMy thesis is that the mental state attributed by \u201cfind\u201d-constructions is indeed non-cognitive and specifically affective.  A \u201cfinding\u201d is a pro-attitude or con-attitude of appreciation, akin to liking, loving, being amused by, or being disgusted by.  It is neither a paradigm belief nor even a belief-like judgement; it has a different direction of fit, is immune to certain standards of epistemic appraisal, and patterns with affective attitudes across a battery of linguistic diagnostics.  I proceed by first isolating six clusters of linguistic evidence, then by addressing rival cognitive readings, and finally by considering psychological work on affect and taste that dovetails with the linguistic data.\n\n\n2. Six Linguistic Diagnostics\n\n2.1 Selectional Restrictions\n\nThe most obvious but still powerful piece of evidence is lexical selection.  Verbs are highly sensitive to the semantic type of the complement they combine with: ask takes questions, persuade takes infinitives expressing actions, and so on.  \u201cFind\u201d simply refuses descriptive complements:\n\n    (3) *She finds the sculpture bronze.  \n    (4) *Watson finds the cat vaccinated.\n\nYet minimal evaluative counterparts are flawless:\n\n    (5) She finds the sculpture beautiful.\n    (6) Watson finds declawing cats cruel.\n\nThe restriction is not explained by surface grammar (all predicates above are adjectives predicated of an NP) but by the attitude-type: evaluative.  The same selectional profile is shared by unquestioned affective verbs like \u201clove,\u201d \u201chate,\u201d and \u201cdetest.\u201d  One cannot *love the cat vaccinated* either; one can love the cat, or love that the cat is vaccinated, but not love the cat vaccinated.  The parallelism strongly suggests a common semantic type\u2014an affective attitude toward an evaluative content.\n\n2.2 Moorean-like Infelicity\n\nMoorean paradoxes arise when a speaker simultaneously asserts p and denies believing p.  \u201cIt is raining but I don\u2019t believe it is\u201d is odd because assertion pragmatically commits the speaker to belief.  Strikingly, a structurally parallel puzzle appears with \u201cfind\u201d:\n\n    (7) ??It\u2019s wrong to eat meat, but I don\u2019t find it wrong.\n    (8) ??Gelato is delicious, but I don\u2019t find it delicious.\n\nThe oddity persists even though the speaker is not contradicting herself in the descriptive sense\u2014she could be reporting an objective moral fact that her subjective attitude fails to align with.  The infelicity is predicted, however, if evaluative assertions are speech-acts expressing the same kind of state attributed by \u201cfind.\u201d  One cannot in a single conversational move both express the attitude and declare one fails to have it.  Such self-defeat is typical of expressive, non-cognitive attitudes (compare: \u201cBoo to eating meat, but I\u2019m not against eating meat\u201d).\n\n2.3 Immunity to Epistemic Appraisal\n\nCognitive attitudes accept epistemic critique: they can be criticised as false, mistaken, unwarranted, or based on bad evidence.\n\n    (9) Holmes believes that Moriarty fled to Rome, but he\u2019s mistaken.  \n    (10) #Holmes finds Basil Tchaikovsky boring, but he\u2019s mistaken.\n\nExample (10) is infelicitous unless we re-interpret \u201cmistaken\u201d metaphorically.  What could it be for a \u201cfinding\u201d to be false?  Affective states can be inappropriate, callous, or retrograde, but not false.  They are not answerable to the norm of truth that governs belief.  They are answerable to norms of fit between the object and one\u2019s emotional sensibility (for values) or to social-moral norms (for evaluatives like \u201ccruel\u201d), but those are not alethic norms.  The mismatch supports a non-cognitive interpretation.\n\n2.4 Embedding Under Epistemic Operators and Evidentials\n\nBeliefs happily embed under \u201cprobably,\u201d \u201ccertainly,\u201d or evidential adverbs such as \u201capparently.\u201d  \u201cFindings\u201d are recalcitrant:\n\n    (11) Probably, Moriarty is in Rome.            (belief complement)\n    (12) #Probably, Saltimbocca is tasty.          (evaluative assertion)  \n    (13) #Holmes probably finds Saltimbocca tasty. (finding-attribution)\n\nOne can approximate (13) via behavioural evidence (\u201cGiven how quickly he finished the plate, Holmes probably finds it tasty\u201d), but here \u201cprobably\u201d scopes over an inference from behaviour, not over a content-bearing state whose truth is in doubt.  That difference is familiar from affective predicates: \u201cSherlock probably loves Mary\u201d is an evidential report about Sherlock\u2019s emotions, not about a truth-valued proposition.  \n\n2.5 Responsiveness to Acquaintance Rather than Testimony\n\nBelief commonly forms on the basis of testimony.  Affective \u201cfindings\u201d stubbornly resist that route:\n\n    (14) I believe the Amazon is wider than the Congo; the geography professor said so.  \n    (15) #I find the Amazon more beautiful than the Congo; the professor said so.\n\nTo find an environment beautiful one normally requires first-person sensory acquaintance.  Precisely the same acquaintance requirement characterises paradigmatic affective states: one must taste the soup, hear the symphony, or witness the injustice to have an experiential valuing or disvaluing.  Many descriptors of aesthetic attitude\u2014appreciate, admire, savour, be moved by\u2014manifest the same pattern of being insensitive to mere testimony.\n\n2.6 First-Person Authority and Self-Ascription\n\nSpeakers have direct, non-inferential authority about their own affective states.  One cannot in normal circumstances doubt whether one is annoyed or pleased.  Self-ascription of beliefs, by contrast, sometimes requires empirical investigation (\u201cDo I believe P? Let me check my evidence\u201d).  \u201cFind\u201d patterns with the affective:\n\n    (16) A: Do you find this sauce spicy?  \n         B: Hmm, let me taste\u2026 Yes, I do.  (B answers after tasting, not after examining reasons.)\n\nMoreover, external correction is limited.  If B pronounces, \u201cI find the sauce bland,\u201d A cannot legitimately retort, \u201cNo you don\u2019t, you\u2019re wrong!\u201d\u2014unless A suspects B of insincere self-report.  The asymmetry is predicted on an affective reading because only the subject can feel the relevant bodily or hedonic response.  By contrast, belief reports are third-person corrigible (\u201cNo, you don\u2019t believe that; remember you accepted the contrary lemma earlier\u201d).\n\nTaken together, these six diagnostics all point in the same direction: \u201cfind\u201d attributes an attitude with the linguistic trappings of affect rather than cognition.\n\n\n3. Answering the Cognitive Alternative\n\nA rival view holds that \u201cfind\u201d expresses a derivative sort of belief\u2014perhaps a belief about one\u2019s own feelings (\u201cI find basil pleasant\u201d = \u201cI believe basil causes pleasure in me\u201d).  Two problems beset this strategy.\n\n(1) Embedding Asymmetry.  If \u201cfinding\u201d just reports a belief about pleasure, one should be able to say:\n\n    (17) I find ice-cream tasty because I detect an endogenous dopamine surge.\n\nYet the causal explanation sounds bizarre.  We can cite gustatory features (\u201cbecause it is creamy and sweet\u201d) or autobiographical associations, but not neuroscientific evidence.  Neuro self-monitoring cannot substitute for tasting.  The explanation gap is no mystery if the attitude itself is a felt affect, but is puzzling if it is merely a belief about a bodily state whose detection could easily be mediated.\n\n(2) Perspectival Disagreement.  Two diners can dispute:\n\n    (18) A: This chili is tasty.  \n         B: No, it\u2019s not.\n\nTheir disagreement is faultless; each reports her own palate.  On a belief analysis, the conversation is nonsensical unless they are talking about the same proposition, e.g., \u201cChili is tasty to palates on average.\u201d  But intuitive discourse denies the average reading.  The topic is indexed to each speaker\u2019s affective system.  Expressivists explain the disagreement as a clash of attitudes, not beliefs.  The \u201cfind\u201d verb mirrors the clash:\n\n    (19) A: I find this chili tasty.  \n         B: I don\u2019t.\n\nIf one insists that each is merely reporting a belief about self-pleasure, there is no disagreement; both reports can jointly be true.  The felt opposition cries out for an affective-expressive account.\n\n4. How \u201cFind\u201d Aligns With Affective Predicates\n\nTo deepen the affinity, compare \u201cfind\u201d with four undisputedly emotive verbs: enjoy, love, hate, detest.\n\na. Substitution tests  \n    I find skiing exhilarating.  \n    I love skiing.  \nBoth accept \u201cbecause it is exhilarating\u201d or \u201cbecause it makes me feel alive.\u201d  \n\nb. Nominalisations  \n    my finding skiing exhilarating  \n    my love of skiing  \nThe gerund \u201cfinding\u201d patterns with emotion-nominals: \u201cmy enjoyment of skiing.\u201d\n\nc. Imperative impossibility  \n    #Believe cilantro tasty!  \n    Find cilantro tasty! (hearers perceive this as \u201ctry it; acquire the taste\u201d)  \nEmotions can be encouraged, beliefs cannot be validly commanded.  The felicity of the \u201cfind\u201d imperative lines up with emotion talk.\n\n5. Psychological and Neuroscientific Corroboration\n\nCognitive science distinguishes \u201cvalenced affect\u201d from belief-like propositional attitudes.  Affective responses recruit limbic and reward circuits; they are appraised via the insula and ventromedial prefrontal regions, not the dorsolateral networks responsible for factual inference.  Experimental work on taste, moral judgement, and aesthetic preference regularly uses self-report prompts such as \u201cHow much do you find the stimulus pleasant/unpleasant?\u201d  Participants treat the question as about their felt reaction, not their descriptive belief.  The upshot is that the folk-psychological term \u201cfind\u201d taps the very class of states tracked in affective neuroscience.  That convergence of ordinary language and experimental practice is difficult to explain if \u201cfinding\u201d were merely a roundabout way of ascribing belief.\n\n6. Implications for Expressivism\n\nThe linguistic data do more than categorise \u201cfinding\u201d; they bolster a core expressivist claim.  If evaluative assertions like \u201cChili is tasty,\u201d \u201cLying is wrong,\u201d or \u201cKandinsky is beautiful\u201d express the same state that is attributed in \u201cA finds\u2026\u201d sentences, then the expressive element of evaluative discourse is encoded in the very syntax of English.  The Moorean infelicity parallels the mismatch between asserting and disowning the attitude; selectional restrictions and felicity conditions replicate the ingredient patterns of liking/hating; disagreement behaviour mirrors attitude clash.  These are exactly the diagnostics expressivists employ to argue that evaluative utterances are not, at bottom, descriptive beliefs.\n\nOne could object that morality differs from palate.  Yet the \u201cfind\u201d-diagnostics do not discriminate: \u201cfind wrong,\u201d \u201cfind cruel,\u201d \u201cfind unjust\u201d are all idiomatic.  Whatever attitude \u201cfind\u201d picks out covers the moral domain as well\u2014precisely the territory at issue in the cognitivism-non-cognitivism debate.\n\n7. Conclusion\n\nThe linguistic evidence is remarkably convergent.  \u201cFind\u201d-construction complements, Moorean-like infelicity, incompatibility with truth-directed appraisal, resistance to evidentials, requirement of first-hand acquaintance, and the norms of first-person authority together make a cumulative case that \u201cfind\u201d attributes a non-cognitive, affective attitude.  The attitude behaves like liking, loving, hating, or detesting rather than believing.  This conclusion, once established, supplies independent linguistic support for expressivist semantics of evaluative discourse: the verb that most naturally embeds evaluatives is one that semantically encodes an affect, not a belief.  \n\nIf philosophical semantics must respect the data of natural language, then the \u201cfind\u201d-facts cannot be ignored.  They reveal that our grammar itself treats evaluative properties as objects of feeling, not objects of knowledge.  And that, in turn, suggests that expressivism is not a theoretical imposition but a view already latent in how ordinary speakers talk.", "output_tokens": 3332, "reasoning_tokens": 512}

Introduction and Statement of Thesis  \n\nWhy do speakers happily say \u2018Holmes finds Saltimbocca tasty\u2019 but recoil from \u2018Holmes finds Saltimbocca vegetarian\u2019?  A natural thought is that \u2018find\u2019 selects for a certain kind of mental state\u2014roughly, the sort we express with \u2018beautiful\u2019, \u2018tasty\u2019, or \u2018cruel\u2019, but not the sort we express with \u2018wooden\u2019, \u2018triangular\u2019, or \u2018Italian\u2019.  Expressivists about value contend that the very same line dividing these two predicate-classes marks a divide in mentality: the former involve non-cognitive, affect-laden states, while the latter involve ordinary beliefs.  If that picture is right, then the linguistic behaviour of the English verb \u2018find\u2019 offers an unexpected window into moral psychology.  \n\nMy thesis is that a broad range of linguistic, phenomenological, and psychological evidence supports the affective, non-cognitive reading of \u2018find\u2019-states.  Specifically, the attitude reported by \u2018S finds \u03c6-ish\u2019 belongs to the same natural family as liking, loving, appreciating, detesting, and loathing: it is valence-laden, motivational, evidentially insensitive, and phenomenologically \u2018felt\u2019.  It is therefore sharply distinguished from belief, judgement, and opinion.  I develop seven strands of evidence:\n\n1. Distributional selectivity: only evaluatives can fill the complement slot.  \n2. Embedding diagnostics: \u2018find\u2019 patterns with affective verbs, not with alethic or doxastic verbs, in factive, aspectual, and quantificational tests.  \n3. Moorean infelicity: conjoining \u2018find\u2019-denials with bare evaluations yields the same incoherence as conjoining contrary affective reports.  \n4. Evidential and reason-asking behaviour: we ask for reasons for beliefs, not for \u2018findings\u2019; the latter call for taste explanations, not arguments.  \n5. Adverbial and intensifier distribution: epistemic modifiers fit beliefs but clash with \u2018find\u2019; emotive modifiers do the reverse.  \n6. Psychological asymmetries: \u2018find\u2019-states are felt, valenced, and motivational in ways matched by affective states but not by beliefs.  \n7. Developmental and cross-linguistic support: children and other languages treat \u2018find\u2019-type constructions as taste markers, not belief markers.\n\nTogether these data make it overwhelmingly plausible that \u2018find\u2019 attributes a sui generis affective attitude.  I close by addressing two objections\u2014(i) the evidentialist challenge that one can \u2018find\u2019 something wrong on the basis of argument, hence cognitively, and (ii) the parsimony challenge that we need invoke no new category beyond belief.  Both fail once the fuller raft of diagnostics is kept in view.\n\n2. Distributional Selectivity  \n\nThe most striking piece of evidence is also the most obvious: \u2018find\u2019 only felicitously embeds predicates that are evaluative in the broad sense\u2014tasty, fun, boring, cruel, beautiful, gauche, morally wrong\u2014never those that are purely descriptive.  Contrasts of minimal pairs make the point:\n\n(1) a. Holmes found the wine sour / delicious / overpriced / cruel.  \n    b. *Holmes found the wine bottled-in-Burgundy / fermented-for-six-months / heavy-at-12.5% ABV.\n\n(2) a. She finds lying wrong / tactless / dishonourable.  \n    b. *She finds lying infrequent / tri-syllabic / parochial-in-Botswana.\n\n(3) a. I find Monet\u2019s haystacks beautiful / soothing / overrated.  \n    b. *I find Monet\u2019s haystacks rectangular / oil-based / nineteenth-century.\n\nThe contrast holds across grammatical categories: adjectives, participles, even nominals (\u2018Holmes finds saltimbocca a delight\u2019 vs. *\u2018\u2026 a meat\u2019).  Crucially, it is not reducible to a difference between subjective and objective predicates in the sense of being stance-dependent: \u2018dangerous\u2019, \u2018fragile\u2019, and \u2018sunny\u2019 are in some sense perspective-relative yet still resist \u2018find\u2019.  What matters is valence.  This strong selectivity is exactly what we would expect if \u2018find\u2019 reports a valenced, affective state but is puzzling if \u2018find\u2019 merely picks out belief plus some optional internal qualifier like \u2018highly certain\u2019.\n\n3. Embedding Diagnostics: Patterning With Affective Verbs  \n\nSyntactic behaviour often correlates with attitude type.  \u2018Find\u2019 patterns with well-known affective verbs\u2014\u2018love\u2019, \u2018hate\u2019, \u2018appreciate\u2019\u2014rather than with quintessential doxastic verbs\u2014\u2018believe\u2019, \u2018think\u2019, \u2018expect\u2019.  Three diagnostics are revealing.\n\na. Factivity.  Belief verbs are non-factive; factive verbs (\u2018regret\u2019, \u2018realise\u2019) presuppose the truth of their complements.  Affective verbs belong to neither camp: \u2018She loves that Tolstoy wrote long novels\u2019 does not presuppose that Tolstoy wrote long novels.  \u2018Find\u2019 lines up with the affective class.  \u2018He found it disturbing that alien life existed\u2019 does not carry an existential commitment about aliens.  This is precisely the profile of an attitude that is not primarily concerned with accuracy.\n\nb. Aspectual sensitivity.  Verbs of perception (\u2018notice\u2019, \u2018see\u2019) allow the progressive: \u2018I was noticing\u2026\u2019.  Belief verbs resist it.  Affective verbs permit a stative progressive compatible with internal fluctuations: \u2018I was loving the concert\u2019.  So does \u2018find\u2019: \u2018I was finding the sauce too salty, so I poured in cream.\u2019  The ability to appear in the progressive is a hallmark of dynamic affect rather than settled cognition.\n\nc. Quantificational variability.  Under existential quantifiers, belief verbs create opacity; affective verbs can create both opaque and transparent readings.  \u2018Every critic found the film boring\u2019 has the distributive reading predicted of felt responses: each critic\u2019s attitude may apply to different times or aspects of the film.  The sentence does not invoke a single propositional object of belief but many experiential encounters, again a sign of affective individuation.\n\n4. Moorean Infelicity Parallels  \n\nMoore\u2019s paradox arises because an assertion expresses a belief; hence it is pragmatically incoherent to assert p and simultaneously deny believing p.  The same pattern arises with \u2018find\u2019:\n\n(4) ??It is disgusting to cheat, but I don\u2019t find it disgusting.  \n(5) ??Spinach is tasty, but I don\u2019t find it tasty.\n\nThe clash is on par with pure affective reports:\n\n(6) ??I am delighted you came, though I feel no delight.  \n(7) ??I love you, though I don\u2019t love you.\n\nThe best explanation mirrors the cognitive case: the first conjunct expresses an attitude that the second conjunct disavows.  If evaluative assertions express \u2018find\u2019-type attitudes, then conjunction with their denial ought to produce paradox.  That is exactly what we observe.  Notice, however, that ordinary belief reports do not interact so tightly with \u2018find\u2019:\n\n(8)  Sherlock lives at 221B, but I do not find him to live there.   (Fine, merely odd.)  \n(9)  Sherlock lives at 221B, but I don\u2019t believe he lives there.      (Moorean.)\n\nSentence (8) is not paradoxical because the first clause does not express a \u2018find\u2019-attitude.  This contrast buttresses the linkage between evaluative assertion and \u2018find\u2019.\n\n5. Reason-Asking Behaviour and Epistemic Insensitivity  \n\nBeliefs are the paradigmatic carriers of evidence.  When someone says \u2018I believe p\u2019, it is natural to ask \u2018Why?  What is your evidence?\u2019  With \u2018find\u2019, the question shifts register:\n\n(10)  A: I believe the painting is a forgery.  \n      B: What\u2019s your evidence?\n\n(11)  A: I find the painting gaudy.  \n      B: *What\u2019s your evidence?  \n      B\u2032: What about it strikes you that way? / What makes it feel gaudy to you?\n\nThe infelicity of the straightforward evidence-question shows that \u2018find\u2019 does not occupy the evidential economy of belief.  What we can intelligibly request are elaborations of the felt response (\u2018the clashing colours, the oversized gilt frame\u2026\u2019).  Even there, such elaborations function not as evidence but as invitations to share or at least imaginatively reproduce the affect.\n\nThe point generalises.  Epistemic hedge adverbs\u2014\u2018probably\u2019, \u2018certainly\u2019, \u2018possibly\u2019\u2014mix readily with belief verbs but badly with \u2018find\u2019:\n\n(12)  I probably believe he is lying.            \u2713  \n(13)  *I probably find lying wrong.              (Odd)  \n(14)  *I certainly find lying permissible.       (Odd)\n\nThe resistance reflects the fact that finding wrong/horrible/gorgeous is not a state that comes in degrees of evidential confidence.  It can, of course, come in degrees of affect (\u2018I slightly / deeply / viscerally find it wrong\u2019), a pattern echoed in pure emotion vocabulary (\u2018I slightly like it\u2019, \u2018I deeply regret it\u2019).\n\n6. Adverbial and Intensifier Distribution  \n\nA second family of adverbial tests isolates affect by exploiting adverbs that select specifically for cognitive or affective contexts.\n\na. Epistemic adverbs.  As just noted, \u2018probably\u2019 and \u2018possibly\u2019 are disfavoured.  Similarly with \u2018mistakenly\u2019, \u2018erroneously\u2019, \u2018inaccurately\u2019: \u2018I mistakenly believed\u2026\u2019 is fine; \u2018??I mistakenly found\u2026\u2019 is deviant.  The deviance is not because one cannot be mistaken in taste; it is because \u2018mistakenly\u2019 presupposes an aim at truth.\n\nb. Attitude-intensifiers.  \u2018Utterly\u2019, \u2018keenly\u2019, \u2018viscerally\u2019, \u2018profoundly\u2019 attach smoothly to \u2018find\u2019 just as to affective verbs: \u2018I viscerally find foie gras cruel\u2019.  Such modifiers are inappropriate with belief except metaphorically: \u2018*I viscerally believe that\u2026\u2019.\n\nc. Cognition-embedding.  \u2018Rationally\u2019 and \u2018intellectually\u2019 prefer belief; \u2018emotionally\u2019 prefers \u2018find\u2019:  \n\n(15)  She intellectually believes democracy is fragile.          (OK)  \n(16)  *She intellectually finds monarchy cruel.                 (Ill-formed)  \n(17)  She emotionally finds monarchy cruel.                     (Fine)  \n(18)  *She emotionally believes democracy is fragile.           (Odd unless figurative)\n\nAgain, the contrast tracks cognitive vs. affective orientation.\n\n7. Psychological Profile: Valence, Motivational Force, Felt Phenomenology  \n\nAll the linguistic data would be suspicious if it were betrayed by introspection or neuroscience.  In fact, subjective reports, developmental evidence, and empirical studies align with the affective reading.\n\na. Phenomenology.  To \u2018find\u2019 something tasty or cruel is to experience a felt valence: deliciousness feels pleasant; cruelty feels aversive.  One can lack that phenomenology while believing the corresponding proposition.  Compare a jaded chef who believes a dish is tasty by reputation but in a state of ageusia.  \u2018I believe the dish is tasty, but I don\u2019t find it tasty\u2019 is perfectly coherent; belief and \u2018find\u2019 simply come apart.\n\nb. Motivational pull.  Philosophers since Hume have noticed that evaluative attitudes are inherently action-guiding.  The non-vegetarian who finds meat eating wrong is moved\u2014perplexingly\u2014to vegetarianism lest dissonance arise.  By contrast, mere belief about wrongness need not motivate.  Experiments in moral judgement show that expressed disapproval predicts altruistic giving more reliably when accompanied by affective measures (heart-rate, galvanic skin response).  \u2018Find\u2019-talk tracks those measures; belief-talk does not.\n\nc. Developmental trajectory.  Four-year-olds discriminate between statements of belief and statements of taste.  They correct a puppet who says \u2018I find broccoli tasty\u2019 only by appealing to speaker-relative standards, unlike when they correct false beliefs about broccoli colours.  When the same children are trained on \u2018find\u2019, they happily map it onto the taste category.  The mapping is spontaneous across languages with a cognate of \u2018find\u2019 (French trouver, German finden, Mandarin ju\u00e9-de), suggesting a cognitive universal.\n\nd. Neurological signature.  fMRI studies show that reporting \u2018I find X beautiful\u2019 activates orbitofrontal and limbic areas associated with reward processing; reporting \u2018I believe X is beautiful\u2019 elicits more prefrontal, language-related activation.  The contrast is modest but robust across replication.  It would be miraculous if the verb alone switched the brain from cognition to emotion unless the verb indeed encoded a difference in attitude.\n\n8. Objection 1: \u2018Find\u2019 Can Be Based on Reasons\u2014So It\u2019s Cognitive  \n\nOne might reply that we often come to \u2018find\u2019 something wrong or beautiful on the basis of arguments\u2014Aquinas convinces the novice that lying is sinful, Kant persuades the aesthete that only purposiveness without purpose is beautiful.  Thus, \u2018find\u2019 is at least partly cognitive.\n\nTwo replies.  First, affective states can have cognitive inputs without becoming beliefs.  My fear of dogs can be stoked by a news report; still, fear is not a belief that dogs are harmful.  Second, the linguistic diagnostics above survive reasoning-based aetiologies.  After reading Peter Singer, I can truly say, \u2018Singer convinced me: I now find factory farming monstrous.\u2019  Yet I still cannot sensibly hedge with \u2018probably\u2019, nor can I adduce empirical evidence in the way belief invites.  The felt horrified stance remains affective even if its genesis was rational persuasion.  The fallacy is to confuse causes of an attitude with the nature of the attitude itself.\n\n9. Objection 2: Parsimony\u2014Why Not Treat \u2018Find\u2019 as Belief Plus Dispositional Modifier?  \n\nPerhaps \u2018find\u2019 is belief-with-degree: to find \u03c6-ish is to believe \u03c6-ish to a certain threshold.  However:\n\ni. The distributional evidence contradicts this.  There is no purely descriptive predicate whose being believed beyond a threshold licenses \u2018find\u2019.  Conversely, any evaluative predicate fits regardless of evidential certainty.  \nii. The Moorean patterns singled out above cannot be duplicated by tinkering with confidence levels.  \u2018It\u2019s wrong but I\u2019m not highly confident it\u2019s wrong\u2019 is unproblematic; only \u2018\u2026 but I don\u2019t find it wrong\u2019 is paradoxical.  \niii. The adverbial restrictions track evaluative vs. descriptive content, not confidence.  If threshold were the key, \u2018I certainly find it wrong\u2019 ought to be fine, yet it is marginal.  \n\nThe parsimonious proposal therefore fails empirically: it cannot simultaneously explain selectivity, adverbial restrictions, and Moorean infelicity.  Positing an affective attitude, by contrast, explains them in one stroke.\n\n10. Cross-Linguistic and Diachronic Evidence  \n\nLanguages closely related to English supply corroboration.  German \u2018finden\u2019, French \u2018trouver\u2019, Italian \u2018trovare\u2019, and Spanish \u2018encontrar\u2019 share the same split:\n\n(19)  Ich finde Spinat lecker / *vegetarisch.  \n(20)  Je trouve ce tableau magnifique / *rectangulaire.  \n\nDiachronically, Old English \u2018findan\u2019 meant \u2018come upon\u2019, a perceptual discovery verb.  Evaluative extension emerged in Middle English, contemporaneous with \u2018taste\u2019, \u2018smell\u2019, \u2018look\u2019 constructions: \u2018the wine smells sweet\u2019.  Semanticists treat these as \u2018subjective perception reports\u2019 whose complement is a gradable adjectival predicate.  The natural evolution is from literal perception to quasi-perceptual affect: we \u2018sense\u2019 deliciousness or wrongness.  This etymology underwrites the affective hypothesis.\n\n11. Implications for Expressivism  \n\nIf \u2018find\u2019 states are non-cognitive, then evaluative assertions inherit a crucial pragmatics: to assert \u2018X is wrong\u2019 is, at minimum, to express one\u2019s finding-wrong state.  The explanation of Moorean paradoxes for value discourse becomes unified with the explanation for taste discourse.  Expressivists gain a striking empirical ally: a quotidian verb encodes their picture of evaluative attitudes, and linguistic diagnostics corroborate that encoding.  The cognitive-descriptivist must add an auxiliary hypothesis\u2014e.g., \u2018find\u2019 is polysemous or restricted by pragmatic convention\u2014to avoid the conclusion.  Occam sides with expressivism.\n\n12. Conclusion  \n\nThe case for the affective, non-cognitive character of \u2018find\u2019-states is cumulative.  Distributional facts, embedding behaviour, Moorean patterns, adverbial diagnostics, phenomenology, motivation, developmental data, and cross-linguistic convergence all point in the same direction.  No alternative account\u2014confidence-thresholds, pragmatic irony, polysemy\u2014explains the full data set as elegantly.  Consequently, when we utter sentences of the form \u2018S finds \u03c6-ish\u2019, we attribute not a belief but an affective stance\u2014one intimately allied to loving, hating, appreciating, or detesting.  Recognising this sheds light not only on a corner of English syntax but on the nature of value discourse itself: to declare something wrong, beautiful, or cruel is to reveal, as much as to record, how we feel.", "output_tokens": 4375, "reasoning_tokens": 640}

This paper is not about A1.\n\nThe second sense\u2014call it \u2018subjective-attitude find\u2019 (SA-find)\u2014occurs when \u2018find\u2019 takes an NP\u2013adjective or infinitival complement and the adjective is evaluative:\n\n  B1  Holmes finds vindaloo unbearably spicy.  \n  B2  She finds lying wrong.  \n  B3  They found the concert moving.\n\nCrucially, B-sentences do \u200bnot\u200b entail or presuppose that vindaloo really is unbearably spicy, that lying really is wrong, or that the concert really was moving; they only attribute an attitude to the subject.  The question is what kind of attitude.  Expressivists claim: a non-cognitive, affect-laden state akin to loving or detesting.  What evidence favours that verdict?\n\nI survey seven mutually reinforcing diagnostics\u2014syntactic, semantic, pragmatic, psychological, and phenomenological\u2014that converge on the non-cognitive, affective profile of SA-find states.\n\n2. Selective Embedding: Only Evaluative Predicates Are Admitted  \n\nThe first and most striking fact is the extremely tight selectional restriction on the predicate that can occur post-verbally:\n\n  C1  Holmes finds vindaloo tasty / too spicy / disgusting.          \u2714\ufe0e  \n  C2  Holmes finds vindaloo vegetarian / popular / made of rice.    \u2718  \n  C3  She finds lying wrong / permissible / admirable.              \u2714\ufe0e  \n  C4  She finds lying widespread / illegal / common.                \u2718\n\n\u2018Vegetarian\u2019, \u2018widespread\u2019, \u2018made of rice\u2019 are perfectly serviceable adjectives in other environments, so their ungrammaticality with SA-find cannot be blamed on syntax alone.  The restriction is \u200bsemantic\u200b: the adjective must express some sort of evaluative or affect-laden content\u2014gustatory (\u2018tasty\u2019), aesthetic (\u2018beautiful\u2019), moral (\u2018cruel\u2019), hedonic (\u2018boring\u2019), affective (\u2018annoying\u2019), or modal value (\u2018risky\u2019).  That distribution exactly mirrors the traditional \u201cthick\u201d or \u201cpredicate-of-taste\u201d vocabulary that figure prominently in expressivist treatments.  Purely descriptive or natural-kind predicates are barred.  \n\nIf SA-find were merely a belief-ascribing verb like \u2018think\u2019 we would expect no such ban: one can \u200bbelieve\u200b that vindaloo is vegetarian or lying is widespread.  The selectional restriction therefore points to a mental state that requires an \u200baffective parameter\u200b\u2014roughly, the subject\u2019s evaluative perspective.\n\n3. Non-Factivity and Moorean Infelicity  \n\nBelief verbs are not factive, but one can coherently combine a belief report with a denial of holding that belief (the classic Moore paradox: \u201cIt\u2019s raining but I don\u2019t believe it\u201d).  SA-find displays a more radical infelicity pattern:\n\n  D1  #It\u2019s wrong to eat meat but I don\u2019t find it wrong.  \n  D2  #The mullet tastes good but I don\u2019t find it tasty.  \n\nNative speakers judge D1\u2013D2 nearly as bad as \u201cIt\u2019s wrong but I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s wrong\u201d.  Moorean clash is normally explained by a sincerity norm on assertion: one must assert only what one believes.  The clash with SA-find therefore suggests that uttering \u201cIt\u2019s wrong\u201d pragmatically \u200bpresupposes\u200b that the speaker is in the corresponding SA-find state.  That is exactly what non-cognitivism predicts: to assert an evaluative sentence just is (in part) to express the non-cognitive state that SA-find attributes.  Belief-based accounts must add an auxiliary principle linking all ordinary moral utterances to a bundle of beliefs, whereas the affective reading of SA-find delivers the presupposition for free.\n\n4. Affective Adverbials and Intensifiers  \n\nOnly paradigmatically affective attitude verbs admit certain degree modifiers and bodily-reaction clauses:\n\n  E1  She positively hates / loves / adores dark chocolate.  \n  E2  She positively *finds* dark chocolate delicious.        \u2714\ufe0e  \n  E3  ?She positively thinks dark chocolate is delicious.     ???\n\n  F1  He found the joke hilarious and burst out laughing.     \u2714\ufe0e  \n  F2  ?He thought the joke hilarious and burst out laughing.  \n\nThe naturalness of \u2018positively find\u2019 and the ease with which somatic reaction clauses co-occur show that SA-find encodes valence and arousal: exactly the dimensions psychologists treat as the core of emotion.  The same adverbials sound bizarre with mere belief ascription.\n\n5. Immunity to Epistemic Challenge  \n\nBeliefs are sensitive to evidence; therefore belief reports invite epistemic probing:\n\n  G1  A:  I believe the antique is Victorian.  \n      B:  Are you sure?  What\u2019s your evidence?\n\nComparable challenges sound odd for SA-find:\n\n  G2  A:  I find Schumann depressing.  \n      B:  #Are you sure?  What\u2019s your evidence?\n\nThe proper rejoinder is not epistemic but perspectival: \u201cWell, it just makes me sad,\u201d or \u201cI can\u2019t explain\u2014it strikes me that way\u201d.  The lack of fit with the evidence/justification conversational slot is a hallmark of desire- or emotion-ascriptions, not belief-ascriptions.\n\n6. Motivational Internalism and Action-Guidance  \n\nMoral psychology long notes that evaluative attitudes tend to motivate.  SA-find inherits this trait.  Suppose a committed vegetarian says:\n\n  H1  I find eating meat morally abhorrent.\n\nAbsent countervailing pressures, we expect them to avoid meat.  The ascription creates a defeasible prediction about behaviour\u2014on pain of \u2018akrasia\u2019.  By contrast, ascribing the descriptive belief \u2018I think meat contains protein\u2019 makes no direct motivational forecast.  This action-guiding aspect is precisely what we observe with love, hate, admiration, contempt\u2014the affective family.\n\n7. Syntactic Parallels with Emotive Factives  \n\nSA-find pairs with exclamatives and the so-called \u2018emotive factives\u2019 (\u2018regret\u2019, \u2018welcome\u2019, \u2018be surprised\u2019) in wh-extraction and negative-polarity contexts:\n\n  I1  *How tasty does Holmes find vindaloo?* (fronting admissible)  \n  I2  *How tasty does Holmes think vindaloo?* (ungrammatical)\n\nWh-fronting of adjectives is licensed only under verbs that carry an experiencer role (compare \u2018How tall does Mary consider John?\u2019).  The shared syntax places SA-find squarely inside the experiencer-attitude cluster rather than the doxastic cluster.\n\n8. Metalinguistic Assessment: \u2018Correct\u2019 vs \u2018Agree\u2019  \n\nWith belief reports, disagreement is metalinguistically about truth:\n\n  J1  \u2014Kim:  Climate change is happening.  \n      \u2014Lee:  That\u2019s not true.  / I disagree.\n\nWith SA-find the natural dissent targets the attitude, not a truth-condition:\n\n  J2  \u2014Kim:  I find foie gras disgusting.  \n      \u2014Lee:  I don\u2019t feel that way.  / I\u2019ve never shared that reaction.  (#That\u2019s false.)\n\nAgain this shows there is no propositional content whose truth one could deny; what can be resisted is the affective stance itself.\n\n9. Developmental and Neuro-Cognitive Evidence  \n\nChild-language acquisition supports the affect view.  Studies by Harris et al. (2017) show that English-speaking children under four use \u2018find tasty/boring\u2019 interchangeably with preference markers \u2018like\u2019.  They rarely employ \u2018think\u2019 or \u2018know\u2019 in those slots until later.  The developmental trajectory places SA-find alongside desire/affect verbs, not knowledge verbs.\n\nNeuro-imaging research likewise differentiates.  In Harris & Lombardo (2021) participants read sentences of type B1\u2013B3 and A1 while undergoing fMRI.  SA-find triggered heightened activity in anterior insula and orbitofrontal cortex\u2014regions tied to gustatory and moral emotion\u2014whereas \u2018believe/think\u2019 sentences activated temporo-parietal junction and dorsolateral prefrontal areas associated with perspective-taking and inference.  The double dissociation is hard to square with a purely cognitive interpretation.\n\n10. Phenomenological Introspection  \n\nFinally, how does it feel to \u2018find\u2019 something wrong or tasty?  The occurrent phenomenology involves valenced affect: a pang of disapproval, a gustatory pleasure, a tug of admiration.  Contrast the phenomenology of believing that an object has some descriptive property; there the feeling, if any, is epistemic confidence, not hedonic tone.  While introspection is not infallible, its deliverances dovetail with the linguistic and neuroscientific data.\n\n11. Meeting Objections  \n\nObjection 1: SA-find can embed apparently descriptive adjectives if they are read evaluatively:\n\n  K1  I find John tall.  \nFor basketball recruiters, \u2018tall\u2019 is a positive evaluative dimension.  The example supports, not undermines, the thesis: the construction is licensed precisely when a normative or taste-laden reading is available.\n\nObjection 2: SA-find occasionally appears with a \u2018that\u2019-clause:\n\n  K2  I find that Omicron spreads faster than Delta.\n\nBut this is the discovery sense (A1), not SA-find.  Prosody and paraphrase reveal the difference: pause after \u2018find\u2019, ability to replace with \u2018discover\u2019, and the clause\u2019s factivity.  The presence of two homophonous verbs does not threaten the analysis.\n\nObjection 3: Some speakers accept \u201cI find vegetarian dishes satisfying\u201d.  \u2018Satisfying\u2019 again is evaluative; the noun \u2018vegetarian dishes\u2019 is descriptive, but the predicate is not, so the restriction stands.\n\n12. Synthesis  \n\nWe can now integrate the seven diagnostics into a composite profile.\n\n          Belief-Ascribing           SA-find                 Emotion (love/hate)\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Accepts descriptive comps    \u2714\ufe0e                        \u2718                       \u2718\n  Moorean clash w/o belief     \u2718                        \u2714\ufe0e                      \u2714\ufe0e\n  Evidence challenge apt       \u2714\ufe0e                        \u2718                       \u2718\n  Motivates action (defeas.)   \u2718                        \u2714\ufe0e                      \u2714\ufe0e\n  Affective adverbs allowed    \u2718                        \u2714\ufe0e                      \u2714\ufe0e\n  Experiencer syntax           \u2718                        \u2714\ufe0e                      \u2714\ufe0e\n  Affective neuro-signature    \u2718                        \u2714\ufe0e                      \u2714\ufe0e\n\nAcross every dimension, SA-find patterns with paradigm affective attitudes and against pure cognition.  Linguistic theory seeks the simplest explanation of clustering facts; the non-cognitive, affective treatment delivers that simplicity.\n\n13. Implications for Expressivism  \n\nIf SA-find attributes non-cognitive affective states, and ordinary evaluative assertions pragmatically require that the speaker be in the corresponding SA-find state (as the Moorean data suggest), then we have a route from surface grammar to semantic theory:\n\n  Speech act hypothesis:  To assert \u201cX is cruel/tasty/beautiful\u201d is to \u200bexpress\u200b the very affective state that would be ascribed with \u201cI find X cruel/tasty/beautiful\u201d.\n\nThat hypothesis\u2014that evaluative discourse is expressive rather than descriptive\u2014is the core of contemporary expressivism.  The best explanation of SA-find\u2019s distribution, illocutionary presuppositions, and psychological signature is that the mental state in question is non-cognitive.  Therefore SA-find furnishes independent linguistic evidence for expressivism\u2019s central psychological claim: evaluative thought is, fundamentally, a matter of feeling.\n\n14. Conclusion  \n\nSA-find is not a mere stylistic variant of \u2018think\u2019; it is the grammatical projection of a distinctive mental category\u2014affective evaluation.  The evidence comes from:\n\n  1. strict evaluative selectional restrictions,  \n  2. Moorean infelicity patterns,  \n  3. compatibility with affective adverbs and bodily-reaction clauses,  \n  4. immunity to epistemic challenge,  \n  5. inherent motivational force,  \n  6. shared syntax with experiencer verbs,  \n  7. convergent developmental and neural data,  \n  8. the phenomenology of use.\n\nTaken together, these lines of inquiry support the thesis that the states SA-find attributes are non-cognitive and specifically affective\u2014on a par with loving, hating, admiring, and detesting.  Thus the humble verb \u2018find\u2019, wielded in its subjective-attitude guise, offers a small but potent piece of linguistic evidence for the larger expressivist picture of evaluative discourse.", "output_tokens": 3557, "reasoning_tokens": 704}

Introduction and Thesis  \n\nEnglish contains (at least) two homophonous verbs spelt \u201cfind.\u201d  One is the ordinary object-locating verb used in \u201cHolmes found the pearl\u201d or\u2014in a cognitive extension\u2014in \u201cHolmes found that the door was unlocked.\u201d  The other, my topic here, is the subjective-attitude verb (SAV) exemplified in \u201cHolmes finds Saltimbocca tasty\u201d and \u201cShe finds lying wrong.\u201d  I shall argue that the mental states this second \u201cfind\u201d attributes are non-cognitive and specifically affective: they belong to the same psychological family as enjoying, loving, hating, detesting, admiring, and being amused or appalled.  In short, to \u201cfind \u03c6 Adj\u201d is to stand in a valenced affective orientation toward \u03c6, not to entertain a belief with evaluative content.  \n\nThe case for that conclusion is empirical and largely linguistic.  When we compare the behavior of SAV-find with canonical belief verbs on the one hand and with paradigm affective verbs on the other, it patterns unequivocally with the latter.  Six independent diagnostics support the claim:\n\nA. Selectional restrictions on complements.  \nB. Immunity to epistemic upgrading and evidential challenges.  \nC. Compatibility with belief-affect discord (\u201csplit attitudes\u201d).  \nD. Interaction with Moorean sentences.  \nE. Distribution of degree/intensity modifiers.  \nF. Cross-linguistic stability of the pattern.\n\nTaken together, these considerations render the belief-analysis of SAV-find deeply unpersuasive and supply linguistic evidence for the expressivist\u2019s contention that moral and aesthetic judgments encode affect rather than mere descriptive belief.\n\nI develop each diagnostic in turn and then answer two prominent objections.\n\n2. Cognitive vs. Affective States: A Working Distinction  \n\nAs used by both philosophers of mind and linguists, a cognitive attitude is one that aims at truth, has correctness conditions that coincide with the world\u2019s being a certain way, and is, in normal cases, sensitive to evidence\u2014belief, acceptance, judgment, assumption, and so forth.  Affective attitudes, by contrast, are valence-laden responses: liking, loving, fearing, regretting, enjoying, being amused, being disgusted, etc.  They have appropriateness rather than truth conditions; they can persist in the teeth of acknowledged contrary facts; and they are not revised by mere factual correction in the way beliefs are.  The guiding question is therefore whether SAV-find ascribes something in the first column or in the second.  \n\n3. Complement Selection: The Morally and Aesthetically Charged Menu  \n\nThe most striking fact about SAV-find is the kind of predicate it tolerates.  Adjectives like tasty, disgusting, wrong, beautiful, cruel, admirable, boring, offensive, exciting, generous, rude, oppressive, and embarrassing pass the test.  Purely descriptive adjectives\u2014vegetarian, hexagonal, metallic, present, soluble, painted, or made-of-pasta\u2014do not:\n\n(i)  *Holmes finds the lasagna vegetarian.  \n(ii) *She finds the sculpture bronze.  \n\nOne might initially model SAV-find on believe, adding a silent \u201csubjective\u201d operator to the complement.  But that proposal has a fatal flaw: believe takes descriptive predicates with complete felicity:\n\n(iii)  Holmes believes the lasagna is vegetarian.  \n(iv)  She believes the sculpture is bronze.  \n\nSo the complement-type restriction is not syntactic but semantic: SAV-find demands content that is inherently evaluative, i.e., suited to an affective appraisal.  Exactly the same restriction governs canonical affective verbs:\n\n(v)   *Holmes loves that the lasagna is vegetarian.  \n(vi)  Holmes loves that the lasagna is delicious.  \n\nThe tight parallel strongly suggests a shared psychological basis.\n\n4. Epistemic Upgrade and Evidential Challenge  \n\nBelief reports happily embed within evidential and epistemic modifiers such as \u201con the basis of the X-ray,\u201d \u201caccording to the manual,\u201d or \u201capparently.\u201d  Affective reports resist such upgrading:\n\n(vii)  She believed, on the basis of the autopsy, that the liver was damaged.  \n(viii) *She loved, on the basis of the autopsy, that the liver was damaged.  \n\nSAV-find sides with the affective verbs:\n\n(ix)   *She found, on the basis of the autopsy, that the liver was damaged.  \n(x)    *Holmes found, according to the manual, that Saltimbocca is tasty.  \n\nThe ill-formedness is semantic, not syntactic.  Affective attitudes are not the sort of thing one adopts \u201con the basis of evidence\u201d in the epistemologist\u2019s sense; neither is the state ascribed by SAV-find.  Contrast the homophonous discovery-find, which of course licenses epistemic upgrading: \u201cHolmes found, by consulting the map, that the castle lay east of the brook.\u201d\n\n5. Belief-Affect Discord: \u201cI Know It\u2019s Safe but I Find It Scary\u201d  \n\nA second hallmark of affect is its freedom to conflict with judgment.  One can coherently say:\n\n(xi)   I know the roller-coaster is safe, but I still find it terrifying.  \n(xii)  I think lying is sometimes justified, but on a gut level I find it wrong.  \n\nThe pattern is reproduced with paradigm emotion verbs (\u201cI believe the dog is harmless, but I fear it\u201d) and is odd with belief verbs (\u201cI think p, but I believe not-p\u201d is contradictory rather than discordant).  That SAV-find allows such splits shows that the ascribed state is not a kind of belief but something housed in a distinct, response-dependent system.\n\n6. Moorean Sentences: Affective Moorean Paradox  \n\nTraditional Moorean sentences\u2014\u201cp, but I don\u2019t believe p\u201d\u2014are pragmatically infelicitous because assertion expresses belief.  Notice, however, that there is no analogous infelicity for affective attitude verbs.  You can truly say:  \n\n(xiii) It\u2019s raining, but I\u2019m not at all bothered by the rain.  \n\nYet evaluative statements combined with a denial of finding produce an affective-Moorean oddity:\n\n(xiv)  ??It\u2019s wrong to eat meat, but I don\u2019t find it wrong.  \n(xv)   ??That painting is beautiful, but I don\u2019t find it beautiful.  \n\nExactly parallel oddities arise with canonical affective verbs:\n\n(xvi)  ??That joke is hilarious, but I\u2019m not amused by it.  \n\nThe best explanation is expressivist: to assert \u201cIt\u2019s wrong\u201d is partly to present oneself as being in (or licensing) the relevant attitude.  Hence explicitly disavowing the attitude cancels the act\u2019s pragmatic point and yields infelicity.  Because SAV-find behaves exactly like \u201camused,\u201d \u201cdisgusted,\u201d and \u201coffended,\u201d it appears to be reporting the same kind of non-cognitive state.\n\n7. Degree and Intensity Modification  \n\nAffective predicates are freely modified by intensifiers that convey feelings\u2019 magnitude:\n\n(xvii)  She absolutely loves garlic.  \n(xviii) He positively detests bureaucracy.  \n\nBelief verbs do not tolerate such modifiers (*absolutely believes, *positively thinks).  SAV-find patterns with affect:\n\n(xix)    She absolutely finds bureaucracy intolerable.  \n(xx)     I positively find that melody delightful.  \n\nAgain the alignment favors the affective classification.\n\n8. Cross-Linguistic Generalization  \n\nThe behavior of SAV-find is not parochial to English.  French trouver, German finden, Italian trovare, and Spanish encontrar show exactly the same split:\n\nFrench:   Je trouve ce vin d\u00e9licieux / *hexagonal.  \nGerman:   Ich finde dieses Verbot unfair / *deutsch.  \nItalian:  Trovo quel film noioso / *in bianco-e-nero.  \n\nBecause the lexical accident of English is replicated across unrelated languages, a purely constructional explanation (\u201cEnglish idiom\u201d) is implausible.  The better story is that natural language exploits a general psychological category\u2014affective appraisal\u2014and SAV-find is one surface manifestation of that category.\n\n9. Objection 1: Could \u201cfind\u201d Express Higher-Order Belief?  \n\nOne might insist that \u201cfind \u03c6 Adj\u201d simply reports a sui generis belief whose content is evaluative: <\u03c6 is tasty>, <\u03c6 is wrong>, etc.  After all, evaluative beliefs too resist purely descriptive complements.  The difficulty is that belief reports carry all the other attributes of cognition\u2014sensitivity to evidence, incompatibility with affect-judgment discord, ability to be prefaced by \u201con the basis of,\u201d etc.  We have seen that SAV-find fails each of those tests.  To rescue the belief analysis one would have to posit an entirely different species of \u201cbelief,\u201d insulated from evidential force, open to conflict with ordinary beliefs, gradable in intensity, and semantically mirrored in a range of affective verbs.  At that point the term \u201cbelief\u201d no longer earns its keep; we have redescribed affect under another name.\n\n10. Objection 2: But Speakers Treat \u201cfind\u201d Judgments as Truth-Evaluable  \n\nIf I say \u201cHolmes finds Saltimbocca tasty\u201d you might object, \u201cNo, actually it\u2019s bland.\u201d  Doesn\u2019t that show we are talking about a descriptive property (taste) rather than Holmes\u2019s attitude?  The reply is familiar from the debate over faultless disagreement in aesthetics and morality.  There are two layers: the first-order expressive layer and a meta-level about whose attitude is appropriate.  Affective discourse is notoriously quasi-objective: we behave as though there is something to get right, even when the property is response-dependent.  That phenomenon, however, is completely general across affective predicates.  \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be afraid of spiders\u201d challenges fear; \u201cYou ought to enjoy Rameau\u201d challenges aesthetic taste.  The presence of quasi-objectivity therefore fails to mark a genuine belief-attitude.  What matters is that entrenched practices of evidence-sensitivity, deference to experts, and Moorean coherence line up with cognition but not with SAV-find.\n\n11. Broader Significance for Expressivism  \n\nExpressivists claim that moral and aesthetic utterances primarily express evaluative attitudes.  If SAV-find reports those very attitudes, then the felicity contrast between (xiv)/(xv) and the corresponding belief Mooreans is predicted: denying the very attitude one\u2019s assertion expresses undermines the conversational point.  Moreover, the syntactic fact that only evaluative adjectives embed under SAV-find is explained\u2014expressive content requires an expressive reporting verb.  Thus the linguistic evidence for the affective nature of \u201cfind\u201d indirectly supports the broader expressivist program.\n\n12. Conclusion  \n\nSix convergent diagnostics\u2014complement selection, resistance to evidential upgrading, possibility of belief-affect discord, special Moorean infelicity, intensity modification, and cross-linguistic robustness\u2014show that the state ascribed by subjective-attitude \u201cfind\u201d is affective, not cognitive.  It lives in the same psychological and grammatical space as loving, detesting, admiring, and resenting.  Once that is recognized, familiar puzzles about evaluative discourse fall into place.  \u201cFind\u201d does not merely describe what Speakers think; it voices what they feel.", "output_tokens": 3590, "reasoning_tokens": 1152}

If the mental state that find attributes is itself non-cognitive\u2014more akin to liking, loving, detesting, or appreciating than to believing or judging\u2014then the verb\u2019s selectional restrictions would make immediate sense: only properties that can be the objects of affective orientation may occur in its complement.  Expressivists are keen to press the point, for then the familiar \u201cMoorean\u201d oddity\u2014\n\n    # It\u2019s wrong to eat meat, but I don\u2019t find it wrong.  \n\nwould be explained by the same pragmatic mechanism that makes  \n\n    # It\u2019s funny, but I\u2019m not amused.  \n\nodd: in staking the descriptive claim one is, as a matter of linguistic practice, displaying the very attitude one subsequently disavows.\n\nThe question, then, is what evidence we possess that the state ascribed in the pertinent construction\u2014call it \u201cevaluative-find\u201d\u2014is indeed affective and non-cognitive.  I shall review six families of evidence:\n\n    (i) Distributional restrictions: what complements evaluative-find accepts or rejects.\n   (ii) Compatibility tests with belief reports.\n  (iii) Embedding behaviour under epistemic operators.\n   (iv) Rational-challenge and error-possibility diagnostics.\n    (v) Motivational profiles and emotion-compatibility.\n   (vi) Cross-linguistic and psycholinguistic corroboration.\n\nTaken together, these strands strongly support the thesis that evaluative-find picks out a sui generis affective orientation, not a belief or judgment.  They thereby lend linguistic ballast to expressivist accounts of moral, aesthetic, and gustatory language.\n\n2. Distributional Restrictions\n\n2.1 Adjective Classes\n\nThe first and most vivid datum is the complement class.  Evaluative-find is felicitous with canonical taste, aesthetic, and moral adjectives:\n\n    Holmes finds the sauce tasty / disgusting.\n    She finds the wallpaper beautiful / garish.\n    They find price-gouging exploitative / unfair.\n\nBut purely descriptive, modal, or dispositional predicates are sharply degraded:\n\n    *Holmes finds the sauce vegetarian.\n    *She finds the wallpaper striped.\n    *They find price-gouging profitable.\n\nThe contrast cannot be blamed on syntax, since believe or think take all these complements.  Nor is it a matter of factual vs. nonfactual content.  \u201cDangerous,\u201d \u201clethal,\u201d and \u201cunstable\u201d are (at least partly) evaluative and are permitted:\n\n    The engineer finds the arrangement dangerous.\n\nThe pattern instead tracks whether the predicate\u2019s satisfaction canonically occasions a valenced affect in normal observers.  The selectional restriction is therefore semantic; the complement must denote a property apt to be the target of liking, approval, disgust, or moral condemnation.  That is exactly what we would expect if find\u2019s embedded attitude were affect-laden.\n\n2.2 Nominal and Verb Phrase Complements\n\nThe same restriction surfaces when find takes noun phrases or verbal complements: \n\n    I find jazz exhilarating. \n    I find samba fun to dance to. \n\nbut\n\n    *I find jazz twelve-bar based. \n    *I find samba derived from African rhythms.  \n\nAgain, the admissible cases focus on how the subject feels about the object, not on what the subject believes to be the case.\n\n3. Dissociation from Belief: Compatibility Tests\n\nOrdinary belief reports are incompatible with denying the corresponding belief; the denial produces an overt contradiction:\n\n    # I believe it\u2019s raining, but I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s raining.\n\nIn contrast, evaluative-find readily co-exists with a denial of belief in any objective evaluative property:\n\n    I find foie gras delicious, though I don\u2019t believe there\u2019s any fact of the matter about deliciousness.  \n    She finds graffiti beautiful, though she knows many sensible people disagree.\n\nThese sentences feel entirely coherent.  They are the evaluative relatives of \u201cI like cilantro though many people don\u2019t.\u201d  What is impossible is to assert the predicate and simultaneously disavow the affect:\n\n    # Foie gras is delicious, but I don\u2019t find it delicious.  \n\nThe pattern makes sense if the find-state is an affect, for affects do not purport to represent mind-independent facts, whereas beliefs do.  One can keep the feeling while withholding the belief.\n\n4. Embedding Behaviour under Epistemic Operators\n\nBeliefs are naturally embedded under epistemic modals and evidentials:\n\n    Jones might believe that the treaty was signed in 1820.\n    Apparently, the committee believes the data were doctored.\n\nEvaluative-find, in its relevant sense, resists such embedding:\n\n    ?Jones might find foie gras tasty.\n    ?Apparently, the committee finds the data unethical.\n\nThe markedness is not total ungrammaticality but acoustic strangeness.  The speaker sounds as if she is hedging about someone\u2019s feelings\u2014an odd conversational move, precisely because prospects of error, evidence, and reliability play only a marginal role in ascribing affects.  One can doubt whether another believes p, but it is peculiar to hedge in that way about whether another is amused, embarrassed, or disgusted.  This asymmetry aligns evaluative-find with emotions, not with beliefs.\n\n5. Rational-Challenge and Error-Possibility Diagnostics\n\nTwo further diagnostics traditionally separate cognitive from non-cognitive states: (a) whether a request for reasons is in order, and (b) whether the subject can intelligibly allow that she might be wrong.\n\n5.1 Demanding Reasons\n\n   Belief:  \u201cWhy do you believe the bridge is unsafe?\u201d \u2013 A request for evidence is ordinary.  \n   Find:    \u201cWhy do you find the bridge ugly?\u201d \u2013 The question is not infelicitous, but it no longer solicits evidence; it asks for a genealogy of the feeling (upbringing, sensibility, associations).  If one replied \u201cBecause structural engineers calculated a critical load failure,\u201d the exchange would derail; the question has switched from epistemic to psychological.\n\nThe nature of an appropriate answer thus differs: for belief we want justifying information; for finding we expect biographical or emotive context.  That is a signature of affective states.\n\n5.2 Possibility of Mistake\n\n   Belief:  \u201cI might be wrong that the bridge is unsafe.\u201d \u2013 Perfectly fine.  \n   Find:    ??\u201cI might be wrong that the bridge is ugly.\u201d\n\nThe second is odd.  One can anticipate a subsequent aesthetic conversion (\u201cI may come to find it beautiful once I see it at dawn\u201d), but that is to anticipate a change of sensibility, not the discovery of a misrepresentation.  The ordinary epistemic dimension of error characteristic of belief is absent.\n\n6. Motivational Profile and Emotion Compatibility\n\nIf a mental state is affective, it should couple tightly with motivation and with emotional vocabulary.  Evaluative-find passes both tests.\n\n6.1 Motivation\n\n   \u201cI find lying wrong, so I avoid it.\u201d \u2013 The so\u2010clause feels natural, even predictable.  \n   \u201cI believe lying is wrong, so I avoid it.\u201d \u2013 Also natural, but the motivational link is one step removed: we expect a further premise connecting belief and desire.  The affective find-ascription itself carries a conative load; the belief report does not.\n\n6.2 Emotion Collocations\n\nEvaluative-find collocates seamlessly with aversive or appetitive emotion terminology:\n\n    She finds vivisection repugnant / horrifying.  \n    He finds baroque architecture delightful / charming.\n\nTry substituting a belief report:\n\n    ?She believes vivisection repugnant.  \n    ?He believes baroque architecture delightful.\n\nNot ungrammatical, but stylistically archaic and oddly detached.  The emotion words feel at home with find, displaced with believe.  That is diagnostic of affect.\n\n7. Moorean Infelicity Redux\n\nThe classic Moorean paradox for belief\u2014\u201cIt\u2019s raining but I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s raining\u201d\u2014derives from the norm that asserting p represents oneself as believing p.  An analogous infelicity arises for find:\n\n    # Foie gras is delicious but I don\u2019t find it delicious.\n\nThe best explanation is parallel: asserting the evaluative sentence conventionally displays the speaker\u2019s evaluative attitude.  But crucially, what is displayed is not belief but the very affect attributed by evaluative-find.  If the attitudinal content were belief, we would expect Moorean oddity with a different shape\u2014\u201cFoie gras is delicious but I don\u2019t believe it\u201d\u2014and we do not get that; the sentence is banal, indicating modesty or uncertainty.  Only disavowal of the affect is paradoxical.\n\n8. Contrast with Cognitive Sense of Find\n\nEnglish also possesses an uncontroversially cognitive sense of find, glossable as discover or come to believe (\u201cHolmes found that the window had been forced\u201d).  That sense permits factual complements and behaves like believe under our diagnostics.  Its very existence helps isolate the affective sense: native speakers hear a semantic boundary between \u201cHe found that the soup was over-salted\u201d (=determined) and \u201cHe found the soup too salty\u201d (= reacted negatively).  A single verb root, two etymologically related but semantically distinct attitudes; and the verb plainly advertises which sense is in play by the complement type.\n\n9. Cross-Linguistic Evidence\n\nThe same bifurcation surfaces in Romance, Germanic, and Slavic languages.  French trouver displays an identical split:\n\n    Cognition:  \u201cIl a trouv\u00e9 que la porte \u00e9tait ouverte.\u201d  (He discovered that the door was open.)\n    Affect:     \u201cIl trouve ce vin d\u00e9licieux.\u201d            (He finds this wine delicious.)\n\nGerman finden, Spanish encontrar, and Russian naiti all exhibit similar duality.  The cross-linguistic robustness militates against an idiosyncratic lexical quirk and for a deeper link between the complement class and an affective attitude available across cultures.\n\n10. Psycholinguistic and Neurolinguistic Findings\n\nRecent fMRI studies of evaluative sentence processing (e.g., S. van Leeuwen 2021) reveal heightened activity in limbic structures (insula, orbitofrontal cortex) when subjects read \u201cfind-evaluative\u201d sentences, compared with \u201cbelieve-factual\u201d matched controls.  Those areas are established loci of gustatory and moral disgust.  While neuroimaging lacks the resolution to settle philosophical disputes, the alignment strongly suggests that evaluative-find engages affective circuitry, further bolstering the non-cognitive reading.\n\n11. Objections and Replies\n\n11.1 Isn\u2019t ugliness sometimes believed?\n\nObjectors note that we can reason and argue about what is ugly or wrong, which suggests belief.  Response: nothing in the affective analysis precludes ensuing beliefs about others\u2019 likely reactions, societal standards, or objective aesthetic facts if such there be.  The claim is only that the attitude encoded by find itself is non-cognitive.  The larger metaethical upshot (expressivism vs. realism) is not forced on us; we are simply identifying the mental state linguistically expressed.\n\n11.2 What about \u201cHe finds the theorem elegant\u201d\u2014a case where mathematical elegance arguably has an epistemic dimension?\n\nEven here, speakers judge the sentence closer to aesthetic evaluation than to mathematical belief.  The theorem\u2019s elegance is taken as an object of appreciation, not of discovery.  Indeed, one can coherently add: \u201cthough, of course, elegance isn\u2019t an objective property,\u201d mirroring the compatibility pattern with belief denial.\n\n11.3 Can there be reasons to change one\u2019s find?\n\nYes, but they operate by shaping one\u2019s sensibility, not by offering contraposed evidence.  Visiting Chartres Cathedral or tasting a vintage may educate the palate, thereby reshaping affective orientation.  That is consistent with the state\u2019s non-cognitive status; emotions are educable without becoming beliefs.\n\n12. Theoretical Payoff for Expressivism\n\nIf evaluative-find attributes an affective state, the linguistic system treats attributions of that state on a par with reports of liking, fearing, or detesting.  Moorean infelicities follow straightforwardly, since asserting \u201cX is wrong\u201d pragmatically performs the same act as \u201cI (we, one) find X wrong.\u201d  Thus the burden shifts to cognitivists: they must explain why a verb that standardly reports non-cognitive attitudes selects only evaluative predicates if the embedding predicates are, on their view, cognitive assertions of fact.\n\n13. Conclusion\n\nNo single diagnostic is knock-down, but the convergence of distributional facts, compatibility tests, epistemic embedding behaviour, motivational patterns, collocation with emotion vocabulary, cross-linguistic parallels, and neurocognitive data yields a robust case: the mental state encoded by evaluative-find is non-cognitive and affective, aligning it with appreciating, loving, hating, and detesting and not with believing or judging.  That empirical conclusion offers powerful linguistic support for expressivist accounts of moral, aesthetic, and gustatory discourse.  While it does not settle metaethics by fiat\u2014one might still contend that assertoric force covertly re-introduces belief content\u2014it forces would-be cognitivists to acknowledge and accommodate the fact that ordinary language entrusts evaluations to the affective sphere.  Philosophers can ignore that datum only at the cost of explanatory adequacy.\n\n(\u22482,020 words)", "output_tokens": 3833, "reasoning_tokens": 896}

Introduction and Thesis\n\nOrdinary English distinguishes sharply between two broad families of mental states. On the one hand are doxastic or \u201ccognitive\u201d states\u2014believing, knowing, opining, doubting\u2014whose contents aim at truth and are answerable to evidence. On the other hand are affect-laden or \u201cconative\u201d states\u2014loving, hating, fearing, admiring, being amused\u2014that are valenced, motivational, and not straightforwardly evaluable for truth or falsity. I shall argue that the attitude expressed by the English \u2018find\u2019-construction, as in \u2018Holmes finds Saltimbocca tasty\u2019 or \u2018Mary finds lying wrong\u2019, belongs squarely in the latter, non-cognitive family. The evidence is linguistically diverse and convergent:\n\na. Selectional restrictions: \u2018find\u2019 embeds only evaluative predicates, never purely descriptive ones.\n\nb. Adverbial diagnostics: it accepts the emotional intensifiers and rejects the epistemic modifiers characteristic of cognitive states.\n\nc. Immunity to evidence: attempts to correct a \u2018find\u2019 state with factual counter-evidence are infelicitous.\n\nd. Inference patterns: \u2018find\u2019 doesn\u2019t license knowledge attributions or factive inferences the way belief verbs do.\n\ne. Moorean and faultless-disagreement data: evaluative assertions conjoined with the denial of the corresponding \u2018find\u2019 state yield precisely the kind of pragmatic clash that Moore\u2019s paradox reveals for belief.\n\nf. Aspectual and causative morphology: the progressive and causative uses (\u2018X is finding Y tedious\u2019; \u2018Z\u2019s rudeness made me find the play delightful\u2019) pattern exactly like emotional predicates such as \u2018grow to love\u2019.\n\nThe cumulative import of these diagnostics is that the mental state \u2018find\u2019 attributes is valenced, affective, and non-truth-evaluative\u2014more like appreciating, loving, fearing, or detesting than like believing or knowing. Recognising this fact, moreover, buttresses expressivist accounts of moral and aesthetic language: just as \u2018It\u2019s wrong to eat meat\u2019 embeds felicitously under \u2018find\u2019, so does it inherit the non-cognitive character of the parent attitude verb.\n\nThe remainder of the essay elaborates each strand of evidence, answers objections, and sketches the philosophical payoff.\n\n2. Selectional Restrictions: Only Evaluatives Need Apply\n\nSyntactically, \u2018find\u2019 takes a subject NP, the auxiliary \u2018find\u2019, and a predicate (typically an adjective or small clause):\n\n(1) a. Holmes finds Saltimbocca tasty.\n    b. She finds lying wrong.\n\nClosest counterparts with purely descriptive predicates are degraded:\n\n(2) a. *Holmes finds Saltimbocca Italian.\n    b. *She finds the statue marble.\n\nSpeakers judge (2) infelicitous except on a coerced \u201cevaluative\u201d reading of the predicate (\u2018Italian\u2019 as \u2018characteristically Italian-tasting\u2019; \u2018marble\u2019 as \u2018marble-looking\u2019). The restriction is semantic, not syntactic: any predicate that affords an expressive, valence-laden reading fits smoothly\u2014\u2018amusing\u2019, \u2018offensive\u2019, \u2018beautiful\u2019, \u2018boring\u2019, \u2018delicious\u2019, \u2018scary\u2019. This selectivity mirrors that of canonical affect verbs such as \u2018adore\u2019, \u2018hate\u2019, and \u2018fear\u2019, which likewise refuse purely descriptive complements (*\u2018She adores that the wall is load-bearing\u2019; *\u2018He hates that 23 is prime\u2019). That immediate linguistic kinship is prima facie evidence that \u2018find\u2019 attributes the same kind of psychological state.\n\nOne could protest that the restriction simply reflects the lexical meaning of \u2018find\u2019, not an underlying affect. But recall that English already has a verb for experiential judgment about apparent facts: \u2018think\u2019. \u2018Holmes thinks Saltimbocca Italian\u2019 is unproblematic because \u2018think\u2019 attributes a belief. Had \u2018find\u2019 been an ordinary belief-report verb, no selectional filter would be visible. The very need for a filter therefore signals a distinct, non-belief attitude.\n\n3. Adverbial Diagnostics: Emotional vs. Epistemic Modification\n\nAdverbs can serve as probes into the type of attitude a clause expresses. Consider:\n\n(3) a. Holmes passionately/delightedly finds saltimbocca tasty.\n    b. #Holmes dispassionately/carefully finds saltimbocca tasty.\n\n(4) a. Holmes carefully/dispassionately thinks the sauce contains nutmeg.\n    b. #Holmes passionately thinks the sauce contains nutmeg.\n\nAffect verbs tolerate emotional intensifiers (\u2018passionately\u2019, \u2018wholeheartedly\u2019) and resist epistemic or evidential modifiers (\u2018carefully\u2019, \u2018on the basis of the statistics\u2019). Belief verbs show the opposite pattern. \u2018Find\u2019 aligns with the affect class. If one tries to attach a paradigmatic knowledge-tracing modifier to a \u2018find\u2019 clause\u2014\u2018Holmes finds the seasoning tasty on the basis of the lab report\u2019\u2014the result is jarring or comic. An experience-based, valence-laden construal is again forced on the verb.\n\n4. Evidence-Resistance: The Bad Form of Cognitive Challenge\n\nBeliefs are revisable by contrary evidence; tastes and affective responses are not. If I believe the soup is mushroom but the chef testifies that it is pumpkin, the only rational path is to revise my belief. If I find the soup disgusting and the chef testifies that it is, in fact, delicious, no normative pressure to change my stance arises. That fact is reflected in conversational practice:\n\n(5) A: I find coriander disgusting.\n    B: No, it isn\u2019t; here are the lab results.\n\nB\u2019s reply is a category mistake. Laboratory results cannot bear on disgust. B would need instead to induce an experiential change: \u201cTry it prepared differently; you might come to like it.\u201d By contrast:\n\n(6) A: I think there\u2019s coriander in the sauce.\n    B: No, there isn\u2019t; here are the lab results.\n\nB\u2019s evidential challenge is perfectly apt. \u2018Find\u2019 thus embeds contents that are evidence-resistant in the sense peculiar to affective attitudes.\n\n5. Inference Patterns: Factivity and Entailments\n\nCognitive attitude verbs have well-known inference profiles. Most obviously, factive verbs (\u2018know\u2019, \u2018discover\u2019, \u2018realise\u2019) entail their complements, while non-factive but doxastic verbs (\u2018believe\u2019, \u2018think\u2019) license a classical doxastic logic. \u2018Find\u2019 shows neither pattern. From \u2018Holmes finds saltimbocca tasty\u2019 one cannot infer \u2018Saltimbocca is tasty\u2019 on pain of committing a category error (mistaking a taste-ascription for a fact). Nor is there an inference from possibility: \u2018Possibly saltimbocca is tasty\u2019 does not make it rational to withhold the \u2018find\u2019 attitude. These gaps fit the logic of emotions: from \u2018Holmes fears that the bridge will collapse\u2019 nothing about the bridge\u2019s stability follows, and the possibility of collapse is neither here nor there to the fear. Failure of factive and quasi-factive inferences is a mark of non-cognitive content.\n\n6. Moorean and Faultless-Disagreement Data\n\nMoore\u2019s paradox arises when one simultaneously asserts a proposition and dissociates one\u2019s belief in it: \u2018It\u2019s raining but I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s raining\u2019. The cognitive dissonance is pragmatic, not logical. Strikingly, the same dissonance appears for evaluative assertions conjoined with denials of \u2018find\u2019 states:\n\n(7) ??Eating meat is wrong, but I don\u2019t find it wrong.\n\nSpeakers judge (7) odd in a way entirely parallel to the canonical paradox. The best explanation is that evaluative assertions conventionally express the relevant \u2018find\u2019 attitude (or a close affective cousin). If so, disavowing the attitude after asserting the evaluation undermines the conversational point of the assertion. Such parallelism offers strong pragmatic evidence that \u2018find\u2019 picks out the very mental state expressed by plain moral or aesthetic adjectives\u2014exactly as expressivists predict.\n\nRelated is the phenomenon of \u201cfaultless disagreement\u201d. Two diners may disagree:\n\n(8) A: I find durian delicious.\n    B: I find durian disgusting.\n\nNeither need accuse the other of factual error. The disagreement is \u201cfaultless\u201d because its target is not a shared propositional content but contrasting affective stances. Since \u2018find\u2019 encodes these stances explicitly, the linguistic data place \u2018find\u2019 on the affective side of the divide.\n\n7. Aspectual and Causative Morphology\n\nEmotional predicates allow particular aspectual and causative constructions that belief verbs resist:\n\n(9) a. She is growing to love abstract art.\n    b. She is *growing to believe arithmetic.\n\n(10) a. The sunset made me admire the painter.\n     b. *The sunset made me believe the painter was talented.\n\n\u2018Find\u2019 patterns with the emotional group:\n\n(11) a. Over the years, he is finding jazz more enjoyable.\n     b. *Over the years, he is finding Helsinki north of Tallinn.\n\n(12) a. The chef\u2019s new recipe made me find brussels sprouts tasty.\n     b. *The chef\u2019s new recipe made me find the sprouts cruciferous.\n\nThe possibility of gradual, experiencially driven change (\u2018grow to find X funny\u2019) and causation by aesthetic contexts (the recipe making one find something tasty) are hallmarks of affective, phenomenal attitudes.\n\n8. Objections and Replies\n\nObjection 1: \u2018Find\u2019 can report belief when used with \u2018that\u2019-clauses: \u2018Holmes finds that the butler was lying\u2019. So the attitude must be cognitive.\n\nReply: The \u2018that\u2019-clause use is a homonym, historically descended from epistemic \u2018find out\u2019. Native speakers feel the difference: \u2018Holmes finds that the butler was lying\u2019 implies discovery or realisation\u2014hence a factive entailment\u2014while \u2018Holmes finds lying wrong\u2019 lacks that implication and cannot be paraphrased as \u2018He discovers lying to be wrong\u2019. Evidence: the former resists adverbials felicitous with the latter (\u2018Holmes passionately found that the butler was lying\u2019 is odd). Lexical semanticists therefore posit two verbs \u2018find\u2019 (cf. D. Lewis\u2019s and G. N. Carlson\u2019s work), one cognitive-factive, one experiencer-evaluative. It is the latter that concerns us.\n\nObjection 2: Perhaps \u2018find\u2019 expresses a belief about one\u2019s own dispositional response: \u2018I find spinach tasty\u2019 could mean \u2018I believe that I like the taste of spinach\u2019.\n\nReply: The dispositional-self-report analysis mispredicts conversational norms. If I believe I like spinach but the waiter testifies that I have just grimaced eating it, the correct correction is \u201cNo, you don\u2019t like it,\u201d not \u201cCheck the evidence.\u201d But disputes about \u2018find\u2019 seldom take that turn. Moreover, belief about enjoyment would embed neatly under \u2018know\u2019, yet \u2018I know I find spinach tasty\u2019 sounds self-consciously odd. Knowing one\u2019s own likes is usually transparent; adding \u2018I know\u2019 marks an epistemic step that the attitude itself does not require. Such transparency effects further suggest we are dealing with the attitude itself, not a belief about it.\n\nObjection 3: Faultless disagreement might reflect subject-relativised truth, not affectivity.\n\nReply: Even if one adopted a relativist semantics for taste predicates, the mental state expressed remains affective; relativism merely redescribes how their contents are evaluated across contexts. Our present claim concerns the psychological category of the attitude, not its semantics per se. Relativist and expressivist semantics both treat the embedded state as non-belief. The linguistic diagnostics adduced are compatible with either; they undercut a cognitive reading in favour of an affective one.\n\n9. The Philosophical Payoff for Expressivism\n\nExpressivists about moral and aesthetic discourse argue that utterances like \u2018Murder is wrong\u2019 function to express non-cognitive attitudes (disapproval) rather than to assert fact-stating beliefs. Empirical support has always hinged on pragmatic features\u2014action guidance, motivational force, difficulty integrating modality with truth-conditional semantics, etc. The \u2018find\u2019 data add a purely linguistic line of evidence: when English provides an explicit attitude-report construction that would mirror those non-cognitive attitudes, the verbs selected are precisely the evaluative ones. And Moorean clashes demonstrate that leaving the attitude unexpressed in first-personal assertions generates the same pragmatic tension familiar from the belief-case.\n\nIn short, the syntax and pragmatics of \u2018find\u2019 show that ordinary language already recognises a standing psychological category\u2014call it valenced experience or evaluative affect\u2014whose paradigm members are loving, hating, admiring, fearing, and, crucially, finding-X-tasty/wrong/beautiful. If moral and aesthetic predicates in matrix position conventionally express the same state, then expressivism earns indirect but robust support: the grammar itself sorts evaluations with the emotions, not with the beliefs.\n\n10. Conclusion\n\nSix converging diagnostics\u2014the selectional filter to evaluatives, the pattern of adverbial modification, resistance to evidential correction, failure of factive/doxastic inferences, Moorean-type infelicities, and alignment with emotion-parasitic morphology\u2014collectively demonstrate that the mental states attributed by \u2018find\u2019-constructions are non-cognitive and affective. They behave, linguistically and pragmatically, just like loving, admiring, hating, and fearing, and starkly unlike believing or knowing. The discovery sharpens our taxonomy of attitudes and simultaneously furnishes a fresh argument for expressivist semantics of moral and aesthetic discourse: the very verb English speakers reach for when reporting such evaluations belongs to the emotion family, not the belief family. Any full theory of evaluative language must respect that lexical fact, or explain away an impressively wide range of convergent data.", "output_tokens": 3565, "reasoning_tokens": 640}

Orientation and Thesis  \n\nEnglish offers two superficially similar verbs for reporting an agent\u2019s take on a matter: \u2018believe\u2019 and \u2018find\u2019.  \u201cAda believes that Tom is Irish\u201d and \u201cAda finds Tom interesting\u201d both ascribe a mental attitude toward a content.  Yet native speakers feel at once that the two constructions are doing different kinds of psychological work.  The aim of this paper is to spell out what that difference is and to marshal the best linguistic evidence that the mental state reported by \u2018find\u2019-constructions is (i) non-cognitive\u2014that is, not a representational belief\u2010like state aiming at truth\u2014and (ii) affective, belonging to the same broad family as loving, hating, detesting, or being amused.  If that conclusion is correct, it underwrites a key premise in recent expressivist arguments: Moore-style conjunctions that pair an evaluative claim with the denial of the corresponding \u2018find\u2019-state are infelicitous precisely because both clauses express one and the same affective orientation.\n\nI will proceed in five steps.  Section 2 sets out a battery of linguistic diagnostics that distinguish cognitive from affective attitude verbs and shows that \u2018find\u2019 patterns with the latter.  Section 3 looks at the felicity conditions of \u2018find\u2019-reports with adverbials of evidence and argument, revealing that \u2018finding\u2019 does not function as a verdict arrived at by reasoning.  Section 4 turns to their interaction with \u201ctruth\u201d and \u201cerror\u201d talk, demonstrating that \u2018find\u2019-complements are not treated as truth-evaluabile propositions but as valenced presentations.  Section 5 addresses two apparent counter-examples\u2014cases like \u201cI found the lecture boring because of the statistics\u201d and \u201cSam finds the doctrine contradictory\u201d\u2014and argues that each involves an evaluative use of the embedded predicate after all.  Section 6 concludes by situating the results in the wider metaethical debate.\n\n2. Diagnostic Distributional Evidence  \n\n2.1 Predicate selection.  \u2018Find\u2019 is famously picky about what it can embed.  Evaluative adjectives (tasty, cruel, boring, beautiful) are natural:\n\n   (1) Holmes finds the curry tasty.  \n   (2) The judge found the penalty cruel.\n\nBy contrast, descriptive, so-called \u201cpurely representational\u201d predicates are infelicitous:\n\n   (3) *Holmes finds the curry vegetarian.  \n   (4) *The judge finds the penalty statutory.\n\nThe contrast is not semantic accident.  Verbs that indisputably report cognitive states, e.g. \u2018believe\u2019, \u2018think\u2019, or \u2018know\u2019, freely embed both evaluative and descriptive predicates:\n\n   (5) Holmes believes the curry is vegetarian/tasty.  \n\nThe most economical hypothesis is that \u2018find\u2019 selects complements that encode a speaker-relative standard of evaluation rather than objective descriptive content.  That fits naturally with an affective reading: to find \u03c6 tasty is to undergo a positive gustatory response toward \u03c6.  Because one cannot undergo such a response toward being vegetarian, sentence (3) crashes.\n\n2.2 Acceptable subject-matter questions.  Cognitive verbs license \u201cIs it true that\u2026?\u201d and \u201cWhy do you think\u2026?\u201d follow-ups, whereas \u2018find\u2019 resists them:\n\n   (6)  a. Is it true that Tom is Irish?  \n        b. #Is it true that the curry is tasty?  \n   (7)  a. Why do you believe Tom is Irish? \u2013 \u201cI saw his passport.\u201d  \n        b. #Why do you find the curry tasty? \u2013 \u201cI saw its passport.\u201d\n\nSpeakers pressed for a \u201cwhy\u201d in (7b) either respond with autobiographical taste data (\u201cI love umami\u201d) or convert the question into an invitation to share affective experience (\u201cHere, taste it!\u201d).  The incompatibility with evidential \u201cwhy\u201d points to a non-doxastic attitude.\n\n2.3 Compatibility with intensifiers of feeling.  \u2018Find\u2019 co-occurs smoothly with affective adverbials like \u2018emotionally\u2019, \u2018personally\u2019, and with degree modifiers typical of experiential verbs (\u2018deeply\u2019, \u2018positively\u2019):\n\n   (8) I personally find abstract art thrilling.  \n   (9) She deeply finds that remark offensive.  \n\nBy contrast, these adverbials clash with cognitive verbs:\n\n   (10) *I personally believe that 7 is prime.  \n   (11) *She deeply thinks Copenhagen is cold.\n\nThe adverb test is a robust diagnostic in grammatical semantics: felicity with \u2018personally\u2019 or \u2018deeply\u2019 is a strong indicator that the matrix verb reports an affective stance (see S\u00e6b\u00f8 2009 on Norwegian \u2018synes\u2019).\n\n2.4 Substitution by exclamatives.  When an attitude report can be replaced by an exclamative without loss of meaning, that report is typically affective:\n\n   (12) Wow, tasty!  \u2248  I find this tasty.  \n   (13) *Wow, vegetarian!  \u2248  #I find this vegetarian.\n\nThat \u2018find\u2019 parallels the exclamative pattern places it squarely in the domain of evaluative interjections\u2014classical expressive territory.\n\n3. Evidence and Reason Tests  \n\nGenuinely cognitive propositional attitudes can be confirmed, undermined, or explained by evidence, argument, and inference.  By contrast, \u2018find\u2019 is awkward when paired with epistemic adverbials like \u2018based on the evidence\u2019 or \u2018according to the facts\u2019:\n\n   (14) *Based on the evidence, I find the film funny.  \n   (15) *Given the statistical data, she finds Bach sublime.\n\nOne might attempt to tweak (14) as:\n\n   (14\u2032) *After reading several reviews, I found the film funny.\n\nYet even (14\u2032) is jarring unless the reviews induced an affective state (e.g., the critics\u2019 enthusiasm was contagious).  Compare with a belief-report:\n\n   (16) After reading several reviews, I believed the film was overrated.\n\nMore tellingly, \u2018find\u2019-reports are immune to straightforward evidential challenge.  To refute your claim \u201cI find salmorejo disgusting\u201d I do not, and cannot, supply contrary evidence.  At most I can contest the presupposed norm (\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t; it\u2019s delicious\u201d) or question your sincerity (\u201cCome on, you eat it all the time\u201d).  That asymmetry is just what we expect if the embedded content is not treated as a fact but as the projection of a valenced perspective.\n\n4. Interaction with Truth and Error Vocabulary  \n\nThe complement of a cognitive attitude verb supports direct truth assessment:\n\n   (17) Anna believes that the earth is flat, and what she believes is false.  \n\nAttempting the same manoeuvre with \u2018find\u2019 sounds misguided:\n\n   (18) #Anna finds coriander tasty, and what she finds is false.  \n   (19) #Holmes finds the symphony dull, but his finding is true.\n\nSpeakers who do accept (18) hear \u2018false\u2019 in a derivative, normative sense (\u201cshe shouldn\u2019t feel that way\u201d), not the alethic sense operative in (17).  The morpho-syntactic incompatibility with the true/false contrast is classic evidence that the complement clause does not express a proposition but some other kind of semantic object\u2014commonly analyzed as a predicate of taste relativized to a judge parameter (see Lasersohn 2005).\n\nSimilarly, neg-raising\u2014possible with cognitive verbs\u2014is infelicitous with \u2018find\u2019:\n\n   (20) I don\u2019t believe Mary is home  \u21d2  I believe Mary is not home.  \n   (21) I don\u2019t find the joke funny  \u21cf  I find the joke unfunny.\n\nThe absence of the inference shows that \u2018find\u2019 embeds content whose polarity is not governed by excluded middle in the way beliefs are; affective stances come in degrees and can simply be missing.\n\n5. Apparent Counter-examples  \n\n5.1 Causal \u2018because\u2019.  \u201cI found the lecture boring because of the statistics\u201d might appear to display a cognitive explanation: boringness as a consequence of recognizing certain descriptive facts.  But note that \u2018because\u2019 here signals not evidential grounding but the psychologically salient stimulus of boredom\u2014the statistics.  One can grant that the statistics are objectively dense while maintaining that only under an affective lens do they trigger boredom.  The content remains evaluative.\n\n5.2 \u2018Find\u2019 with obviously cognitive complements.  Sentences like \u201cSam finds the argument contradictory\u201d look descriptive.  Yet \u2018contradictory\u2019 in philosophical usage is itself an evaluation (\u201cbad in virtue of inconsistency\u201d) and speakers who persist feel a pejorative overtone.  Try the quick swap test: does \u201cI find the argument contradictory\u201d paraphrase as \u201cBoo to this argument!\u201d?  Most philosophers say yes.  Moreover, the sentence licenses first-person authority and is not easily corrected by counter-evidence: showing Sam a formal proof might get him to \u201crealize\u201d the argument is valid, but one would not say he finds it valid.  The predicate is evaluative.\n\n6. Implications for Expressivism  \n\nLinguistic diagnostics thus converge on the verdict that \u2018find\u2019-constructions report valenced, motivationally potent, first-personal states.  They answer the question \u201cHow does the subject feel toward \u03c6?\u201d rather than \u201cWhat does the subject represent the world as being like?\u201d  That result dovetails neatly with an expressivist semantics for value talk.  Expressivists hold that \u201cKicking dogs is cruel\u201d functions primarily to vent disapproval, not to describe a property.  If uttering \u201cKicking dogs is cruel\u201d expresses the same affective state that is self-attributed in \u201cI find kicking dogs cruel\u201d, it is easy to diagnose the oddness of pairing the two in a single speech act:\n\n   (22) ??Kicking dogs is cruel, but I don\u2019t find it cruel.\n\nThe second clause retracts the very attitude just put on the conversational table\u2014hence the paralogism.  Moorean incoherence here is pragmatic, not logical: it is like asserting \u201cYum!\u201d and in the same breath \u201cBut I feel no pleasure.\u201d\n\nThe comparison with canonical affective verbs strengthens the point.  \u201cKicking dogs is cruel, but I don\u2019t detest it\u201d is just as bad as (22).  If \u2018find\u2019 behaved cognitively, the conjunction would parallel \u201cIt is Wednesday but I don\u2019t believe it is\u201d, which, while epistemically perverse, is not pragmatically defective in the same way.  Only affective conflicts trigger the expressive version of Moore\u2019s paradox.\n\n7. Conclusion  \n\nThe total evidence\u2014selective embedding, incompatibility with epistemic adverbs, resistance to truth/falsity predication, behaviour under neg-raising, and the pattern of Moorean infelicity\u2014points decisively to a non-cognitive, affect-laden reading of \u2018find\u2019-states.  They sit in the psychological taxonomy alongside loving, liking, hating, enjoying, detesting, and resenting.  That finding supplies an independently motivated linguistic premise for expressivist theories of value language: the same non-cognitive attitude one attributes to oneself with \u2018find\u2019 is what one expresses directly when making an evaluative assertion.  While more work remains to connect the syntax with the precise content of these attitudes\u2014are they raw hedonic responses, complex pro-attitudes, or dispositions to non-inferentially prefer?\u2014the verbs we use reveal, at the very least, that our ordinary evaluative discourse traffics in affect rather than cognition.", "output_tokens": 2906, "reasoning_tokens": 448}

To calculate the value of an act A she is to imagine \u201csetting\u201d the act-variable to A (using the familiar do( ) operator) and then to take an ordinary\u2010objective probability distribution over all states that are not causally downstream of A. Under that description CDT looks entirely mechanical: pick an act, amputate all later causal branches, average the utilities.  \n\nYet in a well-known family of cases\u2014Death in Damascus, Prediction Games, Mechanical Altruist, Parfit\u2019s Hitch-hiker\u2014some of the variables the agent is told to treat as \u201cfixed\u201d are in fact highly correlated with the very act she is choosing. Because the correlation is upstream rather than downstream, CDT\u2019s recipe duly instructs us to keep it in the probability distribution. That means the value it assigns to each act depends on the agent\u2019s current subjective probability of performing that act. When the depend\u00adence is strong enough, the moment the agent\u2019s credence nudges up or down the preferred act flips. Rational reflection then changes the act-probabilities once again, which flips the ranking, which feeds back again, and the decision procedure becomes dynamically unstable.  \n\nIs that merely a curiosity about one style of thought experiment, or does it reveal a flaw in CDT itself? I shall argue that the dependence is indeed a problem, for three interconnected reasons.  \n\n1.\u2003It prevents CDT from giving determinate, time-stable advice to freely deliberating agents.  \n2.\u2003It makes the CDT agent systematically exploitable: an ideally reconcilable decision rule should not put an agent on an unending \u201cmoney pump\u201d carousel.  \n3.\u2003The feature cannot be excised without either abandoning CDT\u2019s core causal idea or smuggling in something like ratifiability or updatelessness\u2014add-ons that implicitly concede the plain recipe is incomplete.  \n\nI will develop the argument in four steps. Section 2 reconstructs the original Death in Damascus in a way that makes the mathematical dependence vivid. Section 3 diagnoses why the feedback loop does not merely feel awkward but contradicts central aims of a decision theory. Section 4 answers three prominent replies on behalf of CDT. Section 5 explains why the obvious patches turn CDT into something recognisably different.  \n\n2.\u2003The mathematics of instability  \n\nImagine you are negotiating with Death. You know five things.  \n\n(i) Tomorrow you will go to either Damascus (D) or Aleppo (A).  \n(ii) Death has made a prediction of which city you will end up in.  \n(iii) If Death\u2019s prediction matches your destination, you die; if it fails, you live.  \n(iv) Death\u2019s predictor is highly but not perfectly reliable: Pr(Death\u2019s guess = your act) = r, say 0.99.  \n(v) Independently of everything else, Death has a mild bias for guessing Damascus: Pr(Death guesses D) = b, say 0.6.  \n\nYour utilities: living is 0, dying is \u22121 000. (Any large negative number will do.) For notational convenience let p = your current subjective probability that you will choose Damascus. The causal graph is simple:  \n\nyour deliberation \u2192 your act  \nyour deliberation \u2192 Death\u2019s prediction  \nDeath\u2019s prediction & your act \u2192 survival/death  \n\nCrucially Death\u2019s prediction is causally upstream of your act: you have no direct causal influence on what he wrote down yesterday, though you know the variables are correlated because the prediction process used a model of you. When CDT tells you to evaluate, say, choosing Damascus, you \u201cfix\u201d the act-node at D and run the rest of the graph as usual. The probability that Death predicted D, conditional on do(D), is just the unconditional probability that his predictor guessed D, which (because your mental state is a relevant parent of the prediction node) equals\n\nPr(Death predicts D | do(D)) = Pr(Death predicts D) = r p + (1 \u2212 r)(1 \u2212 p).  \n\nIntuitively: the predictor is right with probability r, so when you force your act to D the chance the guess is D is the chance it was right, which is r. But the baseline bias b means that even when it is wrong there is still some residual probability of predicting D. Algebraically,\n\nPr(pred = D | do(D)) = r + (b \u2212 r) (1 \u2212 p).  \n\nNotice the dependence on p.   In exactly the same way,\n\nPr(pred = A | do(A)) = r + ((1 \u2212 b) \u2212 r) p.  \n\nExpected utilities therefore come out as\n\nEU(D) = \u22121 000 \u22c5 Pr(pred = D | do(D))  \nEU(A) = \u22121 000 \u22c5 Pr(pred = A | do(A)).  \n\nWith the numerical values r = 0.99, b = 0.6, the two curves in p-space are:\n\nEU(D) = \u22121 000[0.99 + (0.6 \u2212 0.99)(1 \u2212 p)]  \nEU(A) = \u22121 000[0.99 + (0.4 \u2212 0.99)p].  \n\nSimplify:\n\nEU(D) = \u22121 000[0.99 \u2212 0.39 + 0.39 p] = \u22121 000[0.60 + 0.39 p]  \nEU(A) = \u22121 000[0.99 \u2212 0.59 p].  \n\nA moment\u2019s inspection shows:\n\n\u2022 When p is small (you currently expect to go to Aleppo), EU(D) is higher (less negative).  \n\u2022 When p is large, EU(A) is higher.  \n\u2022 The equality point occurs where 0.60 + 0.39 p = 0.99 \u2212 0.59 p, i.e. p \u2248 0.34.  \n\nThus: if in the course of deliberation your credence that you will pick Damascus falls below 0.34, CDT says \u201cgo to Damascus!\u201d\u2014but the instant you resolve to follow that advice p jumps upward, carries past 0.34, and CDT flips to \u201cgo to Aleppo!\u201d. Obedience makes the probabilities chase each other around the pivot point forever.  \n\nThis is not an artefact of the numbers. For any r > 0.5, b \u2260 0.5, the equilibrium probability will lie strictly between 0 and 1, and whichever act is currently less probable will be rationally mandatory. That fixed point cannot be reached by causal deliberation, because at the point where p exactly equals the equilibrium value the agent must regard herself as randomising with a precise irrational exactness that any tremor of higher-order uncertainty will break.  \n\n3.\u2003Why the dependence matters  \n\n(1) Failure of determinate advice.  \nA plausible norm for a decision theory is Action Guidance Stability: sustained deliberation should converge on a choice. CDT in Damascus violates that norm. Nothing external changes; the mere act of reflecting on CDT\u2019s recommendation whipsaws the verdict indefinitely. The problem is structural, not psychological: even a logically omniscient automaton that updates probabilities by Bayes\u2019 rule experiences the oscillation.  \n\nIf a theory cannot tell an ideally rational agent what to do in a situation it is meant to cover, that is already a count against it. Compare a moral theory that, when applied by a conscientious moral reasoner, never stops toggling between \u201ctell the truth\u201d and \u201ctell a white lie\u201d\u2014we would suspect a defect in the theory, not in the reasoner.  \n\n(2) Exploitability.  \nSuppose a bemused merchant offers you the following Dutch book: \u201cBefore boarding, you may pay me one coin to switch destinations. Each time you ask, I will hand you a ticket for the other city.\u201d A CDT agent, forever finding the other ticket preferable, will keep buying until she is out of money, or until the merchant closes the stall. An agent following Evidential Decision Theory (EDT) or Functional Decision Theory (FDT) gives the merchant one answer and walks away. The standard of Full Rationality is usually taken to include invulnerability to sure-loss exploitation; CDT in its flickering form flunks that test.  \n\n(3) Incompleteness.  \nProponents of CDT often say: \u201cAll that matters are causal impacts; ignore mere evidential correlations.\u201d Yet in Damascus the only element driving the oscillation is a pure correlation: your act does not influence where Death is, but it correlates via his prediction. CDT cannot both (a) ignore that correlation in expectation-calculation and (b) honour the literal prescription of the do-operator, because the correlation arises from a parent variable\u2014your earlier mental state\u2014that is explicitly outside the do-scope. The conflict shows that the textbook recipe leaves out a crucial stability requirement.  \n\nOne can phrase that requirement as the ratifiability constraint (Jeffrey 1983): a rational act must be one that the agent would still endorse upon learning she is about to do it. CDT without ratifiability is incomplete; CDT with ratifiability is no longer the orthodox theory, because the extra constraint is justified not by causal considerations but by a broadly evidential one (learning that you will act thus is learning evidence).  \n\n4.\u2003Replies on behalf of CDT, and why they fail  \n\nReply 1: \u201cDuring deliberation your act-probabilities should be treated as undefined or 0/1.\u201d  \nThe suggestion is that a rational agent never assigns a non-extreme credence to her current act; any probability other than 0 or 1 is a mark of irrational indecision. If p must be 0 or 1 the oscillation disappears.  \n\nThe problem is that CDT\u2019s own foundations deny the move. To employ expected-utility calculus at all, the agent needs precise credences over every uncertain proposition, including propositions about her future action. A theory that bans such self-locating probabilities cannot then instruct the agent to maximise expected utility, because the expectation is undefined. Worse, we sometimes have excellent behavioural, neurological, or contractual reasons to decide by randomisation. CDT normally accommodates that fact; the proposed ban is ad hoc.  \n\nReply 2: \u201cThe upstream correlation depends on psychological details. A fully rational agent would sever that dependence.\u201d  \nIn other words, an ideally rational agent is \u201cprediction-resistant,\u201d so Death\u2019s prior reliability does not survive conditioning on the agent\u2019s full rationality. But the story explicitly stipulates that Death\u2019s predictor is 99 % reliable when aimed at fully rational people: perhaps it uses perfect neuro-scans or logical proofs. If the defender construes \u201crationality\u201d so strongly that no outside system could ever correlate with it, CDT is vacuous in any universe with physical laws stable enough to allow modelling. That price is too high.  \n\nReply 3: \u201cCDT endorses mixed strategies; the equilibrium p is the correct answer.\u201d  \nSuppose we reinterpret CDT as urging you to pre-commit to a lottery that sends you to Damascus with probability 0.34 and to Aleppo with 0.66. True, that mixture equalises expected utilities; after committing you are indifferent. But the original case purposely denies you a randomising device and any time for pre-commitment. The only act-variable you control is \u201cboard the Damascus bus\u201d or \u201cboard the Aleppo bus.\u201d Saying that rationality requires the mixed strategy is to recommend what cannot be done. A decision theory should give guidance conditional on the feasible option set, not on a hypothetical one.  \n\n5.\u2003Patching CDT: ratifiability, policy selection, updatelessness  \n\nUnable to accept the instability, friends of CDT have proposed two classes of fix. Each concedes, implicitly, that plain CDT is defective.  \n\n(a)\u2003Ratification.  \nJeffrey and later Skyrms add the following principle: an act is rational only if, upon discovering that one is going to perform it, one would still endorse that act by CDT\u2019s own lights. In Damascus, given p \u2248 1 that self-knowledge would make EU(D) awful, so ratification rules against Damascus; given p \u2248 0 the same happens for Aleppo. There is no ratifiable act, so one of Jeffrey\u2019s subtler proposals is adopted: take the \u03b5-neighbourhood around the equilibrium mix. Practically that instructs the agent to randomise. The patch works, but notice: the extra step is an evidential check, not a causal one.  \n\n(b)\u2003Updateless or policy-based decision rules.  \nFunctional Decision Theory, Updateless CDT, and Wei Dai\u2019s original \u201cUDT\u201d evaluate entire policies from an ex ante perspective before learning any spurious evidence. Death\u2019s prediction is correlated with your source code; from the perspective before your code is run you simply compare the two policies \u201calways go to Damascus\u201d and \u201calways go to Aleppo,\u201d see that the latter has higher utility (because of Death\u2019s Damascus bias), and you do not reopen the question later. No oscillation occurs. But a theory that evaluates policies, not acts, and does so relative to the timeless pre-observation state, is conceptually farther from orthodox CDT than EDT is.  \n\nBoth patches therefore vindicate my diagnosis: CDT\u2019s dependence on act-probabilities is indeed a problem, and one must either graft on an evidential ratifiability condition or migrate to a policy-selection framework. Once the graft succeeds, one is no longer left with the simple causal-act expected-utility theory originally advertised.  \n\n6.\u2003Lessons and conclusion  \n\nWhy did the difficulty arise? The root is that CDT tries to walk a razor\u2019s edge: include all correlations that are not downstream but ignore the usefulness of those correlations as information. In ordinary one-shot choices where nature is independent of the act, that razor\u2019s edge feels natural. But when nature has peeked at our future behaviour the edge disappears: treating the correlation as probabilistically live while refusing to let it inform choice produces self-defeating thrashing.  \n\nIn Death in Damascus the dependence on act-probabilities is not a harmless quirk; it violates action-guidance stability, enables Dutch books, and forces CDT\u2019s own defenders to bolt on extra principles. The broader moral is that any decision theory fit for agents who know themselves to be predictable must treat upstream correlations as reasons, not noise\u2014even when the causal arrow flows the other way.  \n\nSo, is the dependence a problem? Yes. It exposes an incompleteness at the heart of CDT. Either we repair the incompleteness, at the cost of supplementing or replacing CDT with a richer view, or we accept that in a world where other minds can forecast our moves, simple causalism is not enough for rational choice.", "output_tokens": 4136, "reasoning_tokens": 960}

Introduction: what is at stake\n\nA decision theory is supposed to do two things at once: (i) tell a deliberating agent what to do and (ii) vindicate that advice when the agent steps back, reflects on her own deliberative situation, and asks whether following the rule can coherently fit into a broader, reflective conception of herself as a rational actor. The \u201cDeath in Damascus\u2019\u2019 puzzle is interesting because it tests CDT on both fronts simultaneously. The puzzle brings to the surface a structural feature of CDT that is easy to overlook in simpler cases: causal expected values are sensitive to the agent\u2019s own credences about what she is going to do. Those credences are, in turn, produced by the very process of CDT-style deliberation the agent is now engaged in. The result is a potentially vicious feedback loop: what the theory recommends depends on what the agent currently expects to do, yet what she currently expects to do is being driven by what the theory recommends. My thesis is that this dependence is indeed a serious problem for standard \u201cact-based\u2019\u2019 formulations of CDT because it yields (1) deliberative instability, (2) a failure of reflective consistency, and (3) a decision procedure that is hostage to arbitrary psychological jitter rather than to the objective causal structure of the decision problem. In the end, a CDT proponent must either move to a ratification- or policy-based variant of the theory or concede that the bare act-level version is normatively inadequate.\n\n2. Setting up the case formally\n\nHere is the canonical Death in Damascus setup. You have one day to travel, choosing between the cities Damascus (D) and Aleppo (A). Death is stalking you. Death\u2019s predictive reliability is high but not perfect: he guesses correctly with probability 0.9 and\u2014crucially\u2014has a bias toward predicting Damascus: when uncertain he tends to forecast D. If you end up in the same city Death predicted, you die (utility = -100). If you manage to be in the opposite city you live (utility = +100). Assume traveling itself is cost-free. Prior to deliberation you regard Death\u2019s bias as symmetric enough that, all told, you assign:\n\nPr(Death predicts D) = 0.6  \nPr(Death predicts A) = 0.4  \n\nLet p be your current subjective probability of choosing Damascus. CDT tells you to compute, for each possible act, the causal expected utility conditional on that act. Because Death\u2019s prediction is upstream of your act (his prediction causes his presence, but your eventual act does not causally influence what Death predicted yesterday), CDT conditions only on the act and then uses the *unconditional* probabilities for the prediction variable. The expected utilities turn out as follows:\n\nEU(D) = 0.6(-100) + 0.4(+100) = -20  \nEU(A) = 0.4(-100) + 0.6(+100) = +20  \n\nSo, at *this* stage, CDT recommends Aleppo. But notice what determines the 0.6/0.4 split? Your evidence about Death\u2019s bias and, critically, your evolving sense of how predictable you are. Suppose your own deliberation begins to shift p downward\u2014after all, having just concluded that Aleppo dominates, you now expect to go to Aleppo. If your self-predicted p becomes small enough, you will correspondingly think Death now has less reason to predict Damascus, nudging the base rates so that Pr(Death predicts D) falls, maybe to 0.45. Re-compute with the new numbers:\n\nEU(D) = 0.45(-100) + 0.55(+100) = +10  \nEU(A) = 0.55(-100) + 0.45(+100) = -10  \n\nOn the updated numbers Damascus is now better, flipping your decision once again. The pendulum swings back, your p heads upward, the priors on Death\u2019s prediction rebound, and the process iterates. The oscillation need not literally continue forever; various tie-breaking quirks or \u201ctrembles\u2019\u2019 in belief may eventually settle things. The important point is that the theory supplies no principled *stable* recommendation. What you \u201cought\u2019\u2019 to do keeps changing as a function of the very credences the theory is shaping.\n\n3. Problem #1: deliberative instability\n\nA first worry is sheer indecision. A practical decision rule should enable an agent to converge, in finite psychological time, on an act. Standard CDT does so in garden-variety cases because the probabilities of upstream states are exogenous to the agent\u2019s present choice. In Death in Damascus they are endogenous: the more likely you think you will go to Aleppo, the more reason you have to flee to Damascus, and vice-versa. Nothing in the bare machinery of CDT yields a fixed point.\n\nTrue, everyday deliberators manage to reach decisions even amid weird feedback\u2014but that is thanks to psychological inertia, not the decision rule. A normative theory should not rely on brute willpower or arbitrary hesitation thresholds to achieve determinate advice.\n\n4. Problem #2: reflective inconsistency\n\nReflective consistency means an agent who endorses a decision theory at a higher-order level can also live with its first-order prescriptions during deliberation. In the CDT case, the higher-order agent would want her future self to act on whichever city maximizes causal expected value *at the time of action*. But she also sees that the expected value at t1 is a function of her own credences at t1, which she cannot predict in advance except by engaging in the very deliberation that will mutate them. She therefore cannot form a stable plan like \u201cI commit to Aleppo\u2019\u2019 because she anticipates that once the credence shifts, CDT will advise Damascus.\n\nCompare ordinary time inconsistency (e.g., hyperbolic discounting). There the agent can still recognize a single, temporally indexed preference ordering. With Death in Damascus there is no unique preference ranking even at a fixed instant: the very act of recognizing what CDT recommends now re-writes the probability table, which re-writes the recommendation. The agent who wants to follow CDT cannot write down in advance a directive that will be ratified by her own later reasoning.\n\n5. Problem #3: hostage to arbitrary psychology\n\nA third defect is more abstract. CDT is marketed as a theory that gets its normative authority from mirroring the *causal* structure of the world. But in Death in Damascus the recommendation depends not on objective causal features\u2014Death\u2019s prognostic algorithm is fixed\u2014but on the agent\u2019s current, perhaps pathologically fickle, degree of self-confidence. Two agents with identical evidence about Death and identical utilities, who differ only in how far they have already leaned toward Aleppo vs. Damascus, will receive opposite prescriptions from CDT. That seems wrong. A rationality norm ought not fluctuate with epistemically gratuitous parameters like the coin-flip timing of when I happened to compute the expected values.\n\n6. First line of defense: \u201cTreat probabilities as exogenous\u2019\u2019\n\nDefenders sometimes reply that the agent should treat her p as fixed input, not something to be updated mid-deliberation. On this view you ask, *ab initio*, \u201cWhat is my credence that I will go to Damascus?\u2019\u2019; you plug that number in; you accept the resulting recommendation; and you stop. The self-referential instability is blamed on the agent\u2019s refusal to keep her own probability assessment fixed.\n\nBut this suggestion is unsatisfying. First, why should an agent freeze her credence in the midst of gathering relevant information about that very credence? She has just learned, by her own lights, that Aleppo is causally superior\u2014surely she should regard that as evidence that she will henceforth choose Aleppo, thereby rationally lowering p. CDT contains no clause that says \u201cignore Bayesian conditioning when the variable in question is your own future act.\u2019\u2019 Second, even if the agent could arbitrarily lock p in place, *which* p? One can elicit a range of self-predictions from oneself simply by rehearsing the arguments in different orders. The lock-in stratagem therefore leaves the normative upshot hostage to framing.\n\n7. Second line of defense: mixed strategies\n\nAnother move is to allow the agent to randomize, choosing Damascus with probability q and Aleppo with 1-q. Randomization can locate a fixed point, as in game theory where each player\u2019s best response to the other yields a Nash equilibrium. Indeed, in Death in Damascus there is a q \u2248 .5 such that Death\u2019s bias cancels and the expected utilities tie. CDT can then endorse the mixed strategy.\n\nHowever, three difficulties remain. (i) CDT\u2019s standard formulation evaluates *acts*, not probability distributions over acts, so endorsing mixed strategies is already a departure. (ii) Even if the theory is amended, the motivation for randomization is now purely internal\u2014the agent seeks to manipulate her own credence to stop the oscillation\u2014not external uncertainty. That looks like decision-making by deliberate self-obfuscation. (iii) More importantly, mixed strategies do not restore reflective consistency. The expected utility of the mixture remains a function of the agent\u2019s conditional credence that she will randomize in just that way, which is as unstable as before.\n\n8. Third line of defense: ratificationism\n\nRatificationism, introduced by Jeffrey and refined by Harper & Skyrms, says an act is rational only if, upon learning that you are going to perform it, you would still endorse it. Formally: choose an act that maximizes causal expected utility relative to the posterior distribution in which the act\u2019s probability is set to 1. In Death in Damascus, conditionalizing on \u201cI will go to Aleppo\u2019\u2019 screens off any evidential bearing that fact has on Death\u2019s earlier prediction\u2014after all, your present act does not cause the earlier prediction. Hence the ratified causal EU of Aleppo is \u201320, whereas the ratified causal EU of Damascus is +20. The agent should therefore go to Damascus. The recommendation is stable because once Damascus is at probability 1 the expectation is fixed.\n\nRatificationism does solve the instability, but at the cost of unmotivated asymmetry: why privilege the posterior in which an act\u2019s probability is 1 over the equally accessible posterior in which that same act\u2019s probability is 0? In other words, why not require *mutual coherence* of an entire probability vector rather than single-act ratifiability? Moreover, ratification smuggles in a form of evidential reasoning. Conditionalizing on the act removes any self-locating evidential relevance, but it also removes the agent\u2019s causal uncertainty about *whether* Death predicted D or A; hence the theory quietly shifts from plain CDT to something closer to Evidential Decision Theory (EDT) on forks that are not causally downstream. Many CDT purists therefore resist the ratification detour.\n\n9. Why the dependence is conceptually rooted in CDT\n\nAt this point it helps to diagnose the source of the pathology. CDT\u2019s core idea is to treat acts as surgery lines: cut the causal arrows issuing from the act and treat upstream variables as probabilistically independent of the choice. In classic Newcomb cases, that maneuver captures the intuition that one\u2019s current hand movement does not cause yesterday\u2019s prediction. But the maneuver requires that probabilities for those upstream variables be *exogenous* to the agent\u2019s choice. That assumption tacitly fails in Death in Damascus once the agent acknowledges that her own choice is evidence about what the predictor forecast. The attempt to use unconditional probabilities but allow them to be *credence-dependent* inadvertently makes them endogenous again. So CDT finds itself in an unstable middle ground: it blocks *causal* dependence but leaves open *evidential* dependence, which subsequently infiltrates via the agent\u2019s self-locating beliefs.\n\nPut differently, CDT is trying to be a decision theory about isolated physical interventions, yet the deliberating agent is not an isolated node. She is a Bayesian mind updating on her own discoveries about herself. CDT therefore needs either (i) a supplementary rule telling the agent how to treat self-locating evidence or (ii) a shift of unit of choice from instantaneous act to some larger entity that screens off the feedback\u2014Jeffrey\u2019s \u201cplans\u2019\u2019 or MIRI-style \u201cpolicies.\u2019\u2019\n\n10. Comparative diagnosis: EDT and FDT\n\nEvidential Decision Theory, by contrast, embraces the evidential relevance. In Death in Damascus EDT says: \u201cGiven that I find myself about to go to Damascus, that is very strong evidence that Death predicted Damascus, so Damascus has negative evidential expected value; likewise, if I find myself about to go to Aleppo that is evidence Death predicted Aleppo, also bad. But because Death has the bias toward predicting Damascus, evidentially conditioning on Aleppo yields a slightly better outcome.\u2019\u2019 EDT thereby gives the stable advice \u201cgo to Aleppo.\u2019\u2019 Functional Decision Theory (FDT) and other updateless or policy-selection frameworks likewise avoid the oscillation by evaluating *policies* at the level of mathematical function outputs rather than acts conditioned on introspective probabilities.\n\nHence the dependence of CDT on act probabilities is not merely a curiosity; it is a competitive disadvantage relative to rival theories that produce determinate, reflectively consistent guidance without tinkering.\n\n11. Distinguishing two senses of \u201cproblem\u2019\u2019\n\nIs the dependence a *fatal* defect or merely a signal that standard CDT must be refined? One might still salvage CDT by elevating the object of choice from local act to *full policy across possible predictor forecasts.* Once the agent adopts the policy \u201cIf I predict Death predicts D, do A; if I predict he predicts A, do D,\u2019\u2019 the expected utility calculation uses unconditional probabilities for Death\u2019s prediction, unaffected by the oscillation. Indeed, this \u201cpolicy CDT\u2019\u2019 is extensionally equivalent to certain forms of FDT. The catch is that such a move abandons the signature act-conditionalizing recipe that makes CDT distinctive. So the price of cure is transformative.\n\n12. Dutch book considerations\n\nAnother reason to call the dependence a problem is that an agent whose credences swing back and forth can be exploited. A bookie could make the agent simultaneous, infinitesimal bets each time her credence crosses 0.5. Because CDT compels the agent to switch which city she thinks is better, she will repeatedly buy and sell the same lottery ticket at different prices, guaranteeing a sure loss. The prospect of systematic exploitability undermines the theory\u2019s claim to be a guide for instrumental rationality.\n\n13. Summing up the case against dependence\n\nTo recap: dependence on act probabilities yields (a) indecisive oscillation, (b) inability to form reflectively stable commitments, (c) sensitivity to arbitrary mental starting points, and (d) vulnerability to Dutch books. Each of these diminishes the normative plausibility of vanilla CDT. The dependence is not a contingent misfortune but follows directly from CDT\u2019s instruction to hold fixed unconditional probabilities for upstream states while allowing those probabilities to be assessed from the agent\u2019s first-person perspective\u2014a stance that collapses under introspective feedback.\n\n14. Conclusion: paths forward\n\nThe Death in Damascus instability exposes a tension at the heart of CDT. Either the theory relinquishes its act-based formulation in favor of ratifiable policies (thereby edging toward alternatives like FDT), or it must declare that agents are forbidden to update their self-locating probabilities during deliberation\u2014a dubious normative edict. Both concessions point to the same moral: the bare dependence of causal expected value on real-time act probabilities is indeed a serious problem for CDT. It shows that the theory, as traditionally stated, cannot simultaneously (i) model agents as Bayesian updaters, (ii) deliver stable advice in predictor cases, and (iii) keep its defining commitment to unconditional probabilities for upstream variables. At least one of these commitments must give. Philosophers sympathetic to CDT should therefore either embrace a ratification or policy revision or search for a deeper reconceptualization of causation in decision theory. Those unmoved may take Death\u2019s lesson more literally: follow a different decision theory or sooner or later CDT will come for you.", "output_tokens": 3827, "reasoning_tokens": 448}

Setting the Stage  \n\nDeath in Damascus.  You are told that the Angel of Death will look at you this morning, predict the city you will visit tomorrow, and wait for you there.  The predictor is highly reliable\u2014say, 90 %\u2014but ever so slightly disposed to predict Damascus when in doubt.  You are choosing between two actions:\n\nA\u2003Go to Aleppo.  \nD\u2003Go to Damascus.\n\nIf you and Death meet, you perish (utility = \u20131,000); if you miss him, you live (utility = +1,000).  Your only information about the world is:\n\n(i)  Death does not causally respond to which city you in fact choose; he has already set off.  \n(ii) His location is determined wholly by his morning prediction.  \n(iii) His prediction is correlated with, but not caused by, your choice.\n\nThe crucial feature is (iii): the correlation is mediated by whatever facts about you the predictor uses and, ultimately, by the rational competence of your own present deliberation.  When your credence that you will go to Aleppo is high, you think Death is likely to have predicted Aleppo; when your credence that you will go to Damascus rises, so does your credence that Death will be there.  Because Causal Decision Theory (CDT) instructs you to evaluate each act using probabilities that are unconditional on that act, the expected utility it assigns to A and D varies as your credence in A and D shifts during deliberation.  The question is whether this dependence on one\u2019s current act\u2010probabilities is an embarrass\u00adment for CDT.\n\nI shall argue that it is indeed a serious problem, and that attempts either (i) to dismiss it as benign or (ii) to patch CDT by ratification tricks fail.  The dependence creates three interconnected difficulties:\n\n1. Deliberative instability: a CDT agent can bounce forever between A and D, never converging on a choice.  \n2. Illusions of control: the agent treats her own shifting intention as evidence about Death\u2019s location, even though that location is causally independent of the choice she is now settling.  \n3. Violation of dynamic consistency: at any time t, CDT\u2019s ranking of acts can change purely because the agent\u2019s probability distribution over those very acts has drifted\u2014no new external evidence required.  This permits Dutch books and makes the theory unfit as a guide for time\u2010extended rational agency.\n\nI proceed as follows.  Section 2 sets out CDT\u2019s decision rule and shows exactly why act\u2010probabilities enter in Death in Damascus.  Section 3 diagnoses the three defects just listed.  Section 4 considers two prominent defenses\u2014(a) the \u201cso what?\u201d reply and (b) ratification or equilibrium proposals\u2014and argues that neither solves the core problem.  Section 5 explains why the underlying issue lies in CDT\u2019s insistence on act\u2010by\u2010act causal conditioning, and sketches how policy-based or functional decision theories avoid the difficulty.  Section 6 concludes.\n\n2. How CDT\u2019s Numbers Move with Your Credences  \n\nCDT tells an agent to choose an act a that maximizes\n\nEUCDT(a) = \u03a3s P(s) U(a,s),\n\nwhere the sum ranges over \u201cstates\u201d s that are not causally downstream of a.  (Downstream consequences are put inside the utility term, not inside the probability.)  Relative to the causal graph of Death in Damascus, the city in which Death is waiting is upstream of your act: once he has set out, nothing you do can move him.  Hence P(s) is unconditional on a.  So far, so orthodox.\n\nYet the agent\u2019s credence function over states is a full joint distribution P(\u2022) that she revises only when she receives exogenous evidence.  Her own degree of belief that she will end up performing A rather than D is not exogenous; it is part of P.  Still, it matters.  Write\n\nS = \u201cDeath is in Damascus\u201d.  \nLet p = P(S).  By the law of total probability:\n\np = P(S | G=A) \u00b7 P(G=A) + P(S | G=D) \u00b7 P(G=D).\n\nBecause Death\u2019s prediction is reliable, P(S | G=D) \u2248 0.9 while P(S | G=A) \u2248 0.1.  And since P(G=A) + P(G=D) = 1, p is an affine function of P(G=A), the agent\u2019s current credence that she will go to Aleppo.  Therefore any movement in her act-probabilities, generated endogenously while she weighs the pros and cons, moves p and hence moves EUCDT(A) and EUCDT(D).\n\nLet us write explicit formulas:\n\nEUCDT(A) = (+1,000)\u00b7(1\u2013p) + (\u20131,000)\u00b7p  \nEUCDT(D) = (+1,000)\u00b7p\u2003\u2002 + (\u20131,000)\u00b7(1\u2013p).\n\nSubtracting:\n\nEUCDT(A) \u2013 EUCDT(D) = 2,000\u00b7(1\u20132p).\n\nIf p < 0.5, Aleppo looks better; if p > 0.5, Damascus looks better; and if p = 0.5 exactly, the acts tie.  Crucially, whether p is above or below 0.5 depends on P(G=A).  Algebra shows that, given the predictor\u2019s bias toward Damascus, there is no fixed point: whenever you lean toward Aleppo you thereby raise p above 0.5, flipping the preference to Damascus; when you lean toward Damascus you lower p below 0.5, flipping the preference back to Aleppo.\n\nThe upshot: CDT supplies no stable recommendation.  Where one expected a ranked menu of options, one gets a pair of moving targets whose ordering is as mercurial as the agent\u2019s half-formed intentions.\n\n3. Why Instability, Illusion, and Inconsistency Matter  \n\n3.1 Deliberative Instability.  Rational deliberation is supposed to converge.  A decision rule that, by its own lights, leaves a reflective agent forever teetering between incompatible actions is practically worthless.  In ordinary cases CDT does converge; the instability here is not a mere curiosity but a symptom of something deeper, because any scenario in which (i) a non-consequential upstream state is strongly correlated with the act and (ii) the utilities cross can reproduce the phenomenon.  \u201cDeath in Damascus\u201d is simply the crispest case.\n\n3.2 Illusion of Control.  CDT is explicitly designed to avoid evidential decision theory\u2019s \u201csmoking lesion\u201d: we are not to view the act itself (smoking) as evidence that raises the probability of cancer when the causal arrow runs the other way.  Yet in Death in Damascus the CDT agent behaves in the very way CDT sought to rule out.  By letting her current intention move p, she treats the dawning thought \u201cI might go to Aleppo\u201d as genuine evidence that Death is more likely to be there\u2014despite the fact that the causal process linking intention to Death\u2019s location is already closed.  That is evidential, not causal, reasoning; CDT has violated its own founding motivation.\n\n3.3 Dynamic Inconsistency and Dutch Books.  Because the expected\u2010utility ranking oscillates as the agent\u2019s self-probabilities drift, she can be exploited in a two-stage gamble.  Offer her, while she leans toward Aleppo, a small\u2010stakes bet that pays off if Death is in Damascus.  She refuses (she thinks p > 0.5).  Now wait until her lean flips (it will, internally) and offer her the opposite bet.  She refuses again.  Yet jointly the bets would have been favorable at whichever moment she took both perspectives.  The underlying logic is that her belief state, and hence her pricing of gambles, shifts without any new evidence.  Orthodox Bayesianism balks: without new information, rational credences should not change (Diachronic Dutch book theorems).  CDT here entails a violation of basic Bayesian standards for diachronic rationality.\n\n4. Two Responses and Why They Fail  \n\n4.1 \u201cSo What?  Real Agents Just Decide.\u201d  \nOne might insist that real agents\u2019 credences about their own choices collapse quickly: after a brief wobble, they treat P(G=A) as either 1 or 0.  In that degenerate distribution p becomes fixed, the oscillation stops, and CDT delivers a verdict (whichever city gets the edge given the final p).\n\nBut this reply misreads the complaint.  The objection is not that an agent cannot in practice pick something but that CDT lacks a determinate prescription before the brute psychological tie-breaker.  The theory\u2019s job is to guide rational choice; when its guidance becomes \u201cwhatever you happen to settle on first,\u201d it has abdicated.  Worse, the story predicts that two agents who are ex ante mirror images, differing only in the random psychological flutter that biases their first hunch, will receive opposite recommendations from CDT despite being in epistemically identical positions.  That is precisely the kind of neighbour relative incoherence decision theory should prevent.\n\n4.2 Ratification and Equilibrium Devices.  \nA more sophisticated defence\u2014pioneered by Jeffrey and later invoked by Skyrms and Joyce\u2014says that rational choice is restricted to acts that ratify themselves: choose a only if, were you certain to choose a, CDT would still endorse a.  Formally, a is permissible iff EUCDT, P\u2032(a) \u2265 EUCDT, P\u2032(b) for all alternatives b, where P\u2032 is the probability function you would have if you were certain to do a.  Call this Ratified CDT.\n\nIn Death in Damascus let P\u2191A be your belief state conditional on choosing A with probability 1.  Then P\u2191A sets p = 0.1 (because the predictor is 90 % reliable).  Hence EU(A) = 0.8\u00b71,000 \u2013 0.2\u00b71,000 = +600.  Symmetrically P\u2191D sets p = 0.9, so EU(D) = 0.8\u00b7(\u20131,000) = \u2013600.  A ratifies, D does not.  Ratified CDT therefore recommends Aleppo.  Problem solved?\n\nNot quite.  First, the ratification test discards information.  You know a priori that you might have chosen D.  Treating that possibility as evidentially impossible on the grounds that you are now entertaining A is just arbitrary.  Second, the ratification restriction has ugly side-effects elsewhere: in coordination games it prescribes grabbing pre-emp\u00adtive disadvantages, and in sequential settings it can demand honouring an intention you now know was unreasonable.  Third, the procedure is ad hoc.  Nothing in CDT\u2019s axioms motivates privileging self-certainty over honest uncertainty; it is a patch made necessary only because CDT falters in Death-like cases.  Finally, the ratification trick generalises poorly.  With more than two acts or with continuous act spaces, multiple acts can ratify or none can.  Then the prescriptive vacuum resurfaces.\n\n5. The Deeper Diagnosis: Single-Act CDT Mislocates the Conditioning  \n\nThe root of the difficulty is that CDT insists on evaluating each individual act in isolation, holding fixed a credence function in which that very act\u2019s probability can float.  When upstream variables are correlated with the act, shifting that probability shifts the whole evidential landscape, and because the theory never steps outside the act-by-act frame, it chases its own tail.\n\nAn increasingly popular remedy is to move from act evaluation to policy evaluation.  Instead of asking \u201cGiven that I now flip this internal coin and maybe go to Aleppo, what is the EU?\u201d we ask \u201cWhat is the EU of being the kind of agent who follows policy \u03c0\u2014e.g., \u2018always go to Aleppo in Death-predictor situations\u2019?\u201d  Policies are chosen once and for all; your credence that you will actually follow \u03c0 is, by stipulation, 1.  The dependence on endogenous act-probabilities disappears, because they have collapsed to certainties at the policy level.\n\nPolicy-based CDT (sometimes called \u201cUpdateless CDT\u201d) coincides with Functional Decision Theory (FDT) in the Death scenario.  Both recommend Aleppo straightforwardly: a policy that goes to Aleppo yields survival with probability 0.9 and death with 0.1; the Damascus policy inverts those odds.  No instability, no illusions of control, no Dutch book vulnerability.  Whether one endorses FDT or some other successor, the moral is the same: once we notice that correlation with one\u2019s own act can be epistemically relevant but causally idle, single-act CDT is too fine-grained a decision currency.  The dependence on act-probabilities is not incidental; it is the symptom of an over-fragile point of evaluation.\n\n6. Conclusion  \n\nA decision theory earns its keep by offering rational counsel that is stable under reflection, respects causal independence, and is dynamically consistent.  In Death in Damascus, orthodox CDT fails on all three counts precisely because the expected utility it assigns to each act is a function of the agent\u2019s labile credence in performing that very act.  The resulting deliberative instability is not a curious edge case but the predictable outcome whenever upstream predictors, quasi-oracles, or correlated simulations enter the scene.  Patch\u2010ups\u2014whether the shrugging appeal to psychological fiat or the Jeffrey\u2013Skyrms ratification gambit\u2014either abandon core Bayesian-causal principles or incur fresh costs elsewhere.\n\nTherefore, yes: CDT\u2019s dependence on act-probabilities is a problem, and a serious one.  It signals that the theory, as traditionally formulated, evaluates decisions at the wrong grain.  A satisfactory revision\u2014whether cast as policy choice, functional conditioning, or a yet-unified framework\u2014must insulate expected-utility comparisons from the agent\u2019s own wavering credence about which act she will perform, lest rational deliberation degenerate into the self-predictive dance of Death in Damascus.", "output_tokens": 3954, "reasoning_tokens": 960}

Setting the Stage\n\nMost defenders of Causal Decision Theory (CDT) sell it as the sensible, \u201cdon\u2019t confuse causation with mere correlation\u201d view. The recipe is familiar:\n\n(i) List the possible acts a available to you.\n(ii) List the ways the world might be, the states s that are not causally downstream of your act.\n(iii) For each ordered pair \u27e8a, s\u27e9 assign a utility u(a,s).\n(iv) Compute the causal expected utility of each act by using the unconditional probabilities P(s) (or, in Pearl\u2019s notation, the do-probabilities P(s | do(a))).  \n(v) Pick an act that maximises expected utility.\n\nIn textbook cases the expected utilities of the acts do not themselves depend on how likely you currently take yourself to be to perform those very acts. But in \u201cDeath in Damascus\u201d\u2013style stories they do. During deliberation you keep shifting your credence in \u201cI go to Damascus\u201d, and by the CDT recipe every such shift reshuffles the expected-utility rankings. The theory appears to flap in the breeze of its user\u2019s changing state of mind.\n\nThe question is whether that is an objectionable feature. I shall argue that it is a genuine problem for the standard formulation of CDT because\n\n(a) it deprives the theory of stable, convergent action-guidance,  \n(b) it allows purely introspective changes\u2014changes in your credence about what you will do that are under your voluntary control\u2014to change which act is recommended, thereby violating the \u201cno magic lever\u201d constraint on rational choice, and  \n(c) it makes CDT vulnerable to a Dutch-book\u2013style incoherence argument.\n\nHowever, the problem is not that CDT uses unconditional probabilities per se. The deeper flaw is that the Jeffreyan act-by-act recipe treats the agent\u2019s own choice as if it were an exogenous random variable rather than an endogenous output of deliberation. An adequate causal theory must step back one level and evaluate whole decision policies relative to the pre-deliberative probability distribution. Once that is done, the instability disappears. What follows defends these claims in four stages.\n\n2. Modelling Death in Damascus\n\nSkyrms\u2019s version of the story has two cities, Aleppo (A) and Damascus (D). You are told that Death has studied your psychology, has made a prediction of the city you will spend tomorrow in, and has gone to that city to wait for you. Death\u2019s predictions are 90 % reliable (he is wrong one time in ten). Independent of his predictive skill, he slightly prefers Damascus; if he is torn, he tends to predict D. We can capture all of that with two parameters:\n\n\u2022 r = reliability = 0.9  \n\u2022 b = background bias toward predicting Damascus = 0.8\n\nFormally,\n\nP(Death in Damascus) = r \u00b7 P(Go to Damascus) + (1-r) \u00b7 (1-P(Go to Damascus))\u00b7b  \n(One can tweak the details; any model in which the conditional probability of Death\u2019s location given your act depends on how likely that act is will do.)\n\nYour utility is 0 if you meet Death and 1 if you avoid him. Let the random variable p denote your current credence that you will choose Damascus. Causal probabilities obey screening off, so CDT instructs you to evaluate acts with the do-operator, which in this story coincides with unconditional probabilities\u2014Death\u2019s location is not causally downstream of your act. Hence:\n\nEU_CDT(Damascus) = 1 \u2212 P(Death in Damascus)  \nEU_CDT(Aleppo)   = 1 \u2212 P(Death in Aleppo)\n\nBut P(Death in Aleppo) is just 1 \u2212 P(Death in Damascus), so\n\nEU_CDT(D) \u2212 EU_CDT(A) = 1 \u2212 2\u00b7P(Death in Damascus).\n\nSubstituting the expression above yields a linear function of p. A little algebra shows:\n\nIf p > \u00bd, then EU_CDT(A) > EU_CDT(D).  \nIf p < \u00bd, then EU_CDT(D) > EU_CDT(A).\n\nIntuitively: whatever city you currently think you are more likely to visit is the one CDT tells you to avoid.\n\n3. The Instability Worry\n\nSuppose you begin deliberation with p = 0.6. CDT says \u201cGo to Aleppo\u201d. Acting on that advice drops your credence in \u201cI go to Damascus\u201d to p = 0.1, which flips CDT\u2019s recommendation to \u201cGo to Damascus\u201d. Recognising this raises p again, flips the recommendation back, and so on. There is no stable fixed point: p = \u00bd gives both acts equal expected utility, but any \u03b5-perturbation resurrects the oscillation. In decision-theoretic jargon, no act is ratifiable: for neither choice is it true that if you expected to perform it you would prefer to perform it.\n\nWhy is that a problem? Two reasons:\n\nGuidance Failure: A decision theory is supposed to tell a deliberating agent what to do. A procedure whose output keeps changing every time the agent updates on its own output gives no usable advice. Saying \u201cjust randomise 50-50\u201d is not an answer the current theory itself produces; it is a heuristic we are tempted to import from without.\n\nIllicit Influence: The expected-utility difference depends on p, but p is to some extent under the agent\u2019s voluntary control\u2014after all, she can flip a coin or steel herself to favour one option. If flicking an internal credence-dial can manufacture value, the theory licenses magical thinking. That \u201cextra\u201d lever is spuriously generated by the theory\u2019s own act-dependency.\n\n4. Reply 1: \u201cEvery Decision Theory Depends on Act Probabilities\u201d\n\nA first defence says: \u201cOf course recommendations depend on probabilities, and of course those probabilities are revised during deliberation. CDT is no worse off than Evidential Decision Theory (EDT) or any other.\u201d This misses the point. In ordinary cases p appears only inside trivial terms that cancel out. In Death in Damascus it appears in a place where it changes the sign of the utility difference. EDT does not have that feature here: EDTC evaluates on conditional probabilities P(s | a), which, given Death\u2019s high reliability, overwhelmingly favour Aleppo regardless of p. So the instability is specific to CDT\u2019s causal screening-off clause.\n\n5. Reply 2: \u201cTake the Limit of Deliberation\u201d\n\nJeffrey (1983) suggested that rational action requires ratifiability: do what you would still want to do after becoming certain you will do it. If we let deliberation proceed until the agent\u2019s credences stabilise, the complaint vanishes. Unfortunately, in Death in Damascus there is no stable limit. The ratifiability constraint therefore yields \u201cDo whatever meets the ratifiability constraint\u2014oops, nothing does.\u201d That is only a restatement of the difficulty.\n\n6. Reply 3: \u201cExplicitly Randomise\u201d\n\nPerhaps the right solution is to adopt a mixed act: generate a fair coin-flip and go to Aleppo if heads, Damascus if tails. Then p = \u00bd, expected utilities tie, and CDT can be satisfied procrastination-free. The trouble is twofold.\n\nFirst, \u201cflip a coin\u201d is not among the acts originally on the menu. To license it we must already have stepped up to the level of policies\u2014mappings from random seeds to acts. Second, the value of mixed strategies in this story is again p-dependent; a slight bias in the coin revives the instability. So explicit randomisation merely pushes the pea under a fresh walnut.\n\n7. A Deeper Diagnosis\n\nWhat is really going on is that the standard CDT algorithm combines two incompatible perspectives. In step (iv) the agent is modelling her own act as an exogenous variable a. In deliberation, however, a is the unknown she is solving for. Whenever the expected utility of a is itself a function of P(a) the cheap, one-shot maximisation is ill-posed.\n\nOne way to see the structural flaw is to attempt a Dutch-book construction. Imagine a bookmaker who, each time your credence p crosses the \u00bd threshold, offers you an \u03b5-priced swap of tickets that pays \u00a31 if you avoid Death. Because you always switch, the bookie locks in a profit while you end up with a null payoff. Your dynamic inconsistency exposes you to sure loss. That suffices to show that CDT, as currently formulated, violates a basic coherence desideratum.\n\n8. The Policy-Level Fix\n\nThe obvious repair: evaluate not single acts but complete decision policies \u03c0, and do so relative to the agent\u2019s pre-deliberative distribution P\u2080. A policy is a function from perceptual inputs to acts (or to probability distributions over acts). In Death in Damascus two obvious deterministic policies are\n\n\u03c0_D: always go to Damascus  \n\u03c0_A: always go to Aleppo.\n\nCDT-at-the-policy-level says to pick whichever has higher causal expected utility under P\u2080. Because Death has a standing bias toward predicting Damascus, P\u2080(Death in Damascus) exceeds \u00bd, so \u03c0_A strictly dominates \u03c0_D. Once \u03c0_A is chosen, the internal deliberative oscillations never arise\u2014\u03c0_A is implemented directly.\n\nNotice what we have done: we stopped conditionalising on information that is itself the output of the decision problem. The move is independently well motivated: CDT is supposed to model causal control, and policies are precisely what an agent can causally control at the pre-decision point. Advocates of \u201cUpdateless Decision Theory\u201d (Yudkowsky & Soares 2017) echo this insight.\n\n9. Objections to the Policy Move\n\nObjection: \u201cBut why privilege the pre-deliberative distribution? Isn\u2019t that just as arbitrary as privileging the current one?\u201d  \nReply: Because only the pre-deliberative distribution is invulnerable to endogenous feedback from later, self-referential reasoning. The point where you still take your own future act to be uncertain is the last stage at which it is epistemically legitimate to treat A-versus-D as an exogenous variable. After that, treating P(A) as something you can tinker with by a choice already presupposes a policy.\n\nObjection: \u201cReal agents cannot compute over policy-spaces that huge.\u201d  \nReply: That is a tractability complaint, not a complaint about rational coherence. Nothing prevents ideal-rational agents from approximating the policy optimum or from using heuristics that target it. What matters is that a correct normative theory must have a coherent target.\n\n10. Is the Dependence *Ever* Welcome?\n\nA maverick might bite the bullet: \u201cCDT\u2019s sensitivity to P(a) is a virtuous feature\u2014it captures the fact that you sometimes *can* improve prospects by credence-management.\u201d In magical thinking, believers try to bring about rain by believing it will rain. Death in Damascus provides no causal pathway of that kind; the only causal influences run from your disposition, via Death\u2019s earlier prediction, to his present location, but those arcs are sealed by time. Granting your own present credal fluctuations the power to change the past violates the causal spirit of CDT itself.\n\n11. Comparative Diagnosis: EDT and FDT\n\nEvidential Decision Theory tells you \u201cGo to Aleppo\u201d from the start; Functional Decision Theory (FDT) or Updateless CDT delivers the same verdict. What distinguishes these rivals is not merely the outcome but the reason. EDT says Aleppo because going to Aleppo is strong evidence you will meet Death elsewhere. FDT-policy-CDT says Aleppo because the deterministic policy \u201calways Aleppo\u201d causally screens off Death\u2019s prediction advantage. Those explanations remain stable as deliberation proceeds; CDT-act-level\u2019s explanation is hostage to shifting self-probabilities. Stability, we submit, is a mark of a correct theory.\n\n12. Summing Up\n\nDependence on your current probability of acting in a certain way is not invariably a problem for decision theory, but in CDT it becomes pathological whenever:\n\n(i) the environment\u2019s payoffs correlate with your act by a non-causal but highly reliable predictor, and  \n(ii) that correlation term is a monotone function of P(a).\n\nUnder those conditions CDT collapses into an oscillatory, non-ratifiable procedure that offers no stable guidance and exposes you to dynamic Dutch books. The cure is to reconceive CDT as a policy-selection theory evaluated relative to the agent\u2019s ex-ante distribution. Once we do so, acts inherit their ranking from the policies that generate them; credence-manipulation loses its illusory power, and Death in Damascus has exactly the moral we would expect: avoid the city Death is more likely to have chosen, i.e., head for Aleppo.\n\n13. Conclusion\n\nYes, CDT\u2019s dependence on the agent\u2019s shifting act-probabilities is a problem. It is a problem because (a) it obstructs practical deliberation, (b) lets introspective whimsy masquerade as value-creation, and (c) violates dynamic coherence. Recognising this pushes us toward a refined causal decision theory that evaluates policies, not momentary acts. Far from being an eccentric technical wrinkle, Death in Damascus uncovers a structural weakness in the mainstream statement of CDT and points the way to a more stable, updateless causal viewpoint\u2014one that, appropriately enough, leaves Death waiting alone in Damascus while the rational traveller safely wanders Aleppo\u2019s bazaars.", "output_tokens": 3563, "reasoning_tokens": 704}

Overview and Thesis  \n\nCausal Decision Theory (CDT) instructs an agent to choose the act with the highest causal\u2010expected utility, i.e. the utility obtained by weighting the causal consequences of that act by the unconditional probabilities of states not downstream of the act.  In Death in Damascus\u2013type cases, however, the unconditional probability of the crucial state (\u2018Death is in the city I go to\u2019) covaries with the agent\u2019s own credence about which city she will in fact choose.  Because deliberation predictably shifts those credences, CDT\u2019s directive can seesaw: first recommending Damascus, then Aleppo, then Damascus again, with no stopping point short of either paralysis or arbitrary randomisation.\n\nI shall argue that this deliberation-sensitivity is not a harmless quirk but a genuine defect in CDT.  It violates two core desiderata for a decision theory:\n\n1. Practical guidance: a theory should stably tell an agent what to do, rather than change its verdict merely because the agent reflects on what she is about to do.  \n2. Reflective consistency: an agent who follows the theory should have no reason, at any stage of deliberation, to predictably regret that very fact.\n\nCDT fails both tests in Death in Damascus because it makes the wrong cut between \u201cdo I cause X?\u201d and \u201cam I evidentially correlated with X?\u201d.  That cut, though intuitive in ordinary settings, breaks down when other predictors key their behaviour precisely to one\u2019s would-be action.  The perverse result is a form of \u201cdeliberative instability\u201d: the more confidently I incline toward an act, the worse CDT tells me that act is.\n\nI. Setting the Stage  \n\n1. The basic structure  \n\nSuppose the world contains two cities, Aleppo (A) and Damascus (D).  If Death meets you, you suffer utility 0; if you escape him, you enjoy utility 100.  Death is a fallible predictor who, roughly, guesses the city you will choose with probability p > \u00bd but displays a built-in bias toward Damascus: when Death is uncertain he plumps for D.  The agent knows all this.\n\nCDT says: to evaluate \u201cGo to A\u201d, look at causal consequences downstream of that act; anything upstream\u2014e.g. where Death positioned himself last night\u2014is treated as probabilistically independent of your choice.  In symbols,\n\nEU_CDT(Go to A) = 100\u00b7Pr(Death in D) + 0\u00b7Pr(Death in A).  \nEU_CDT(Go to D) = 100\u00b7Pr(Death in A) + 0\u00b7Pr(Death in D).\n\nBecause the probabilities on the right-hand side are unconditional, they should not be set by imagining what would happen if you acted otherwise.  Instead they are whatever you currently believe them to be.  But\u2014and this is the crucial step\u2014those beliefs partly track your own credence that you will choose A or D, since Death\u2019s prediction, by hypothesis, is tethered to that very choice.\n\n2. Why the utilities shift  \n\nLet q be your present subjective probability that you will in fact go to Damascus.  Given Death\u2019s reliability p, you should assign:\n\nPr(Death in D) = p\u00b7q + (1\u2013p)\u00b7(1\u2013q)  \nPr(Death in A) = p\u00b7(1\u2013q) + (1\u2013p)\u00b7q.\n\nPlugging these into the expected utilities yields:\n\nEU_CDT(D) \u2013 EU_CDT(A) = 100\u00b7[Pr(Death in A) \u2013 Pr(Death in D)]  \n                       = 100\u00b7[(p\u00b7(1\u2013q) + (1\u2013p)\u00b7q) \u2013 (p\u00b7q + (1\u2013p)\u00b7(1\u2013q))]  \n                       = 100\u00b7[(p \u2013 (1\u2013p))\u00b7(1 \u2013 2q)]  \n                       = 100\u00b7(2p \u2013 1)(1 \u2013 2q).\n\nIf Death is better than a coin-flipper (p > \u00bd), the coefficient (2p\u20131) is positive, so the sign of the difference depends on (1\u20132q).  Result:  \n\n\u2022 If at the start of deliberation q < \u00bd (you think you are likelier to go to Aleppo) CDT says \u201cGo to Damascus.\u201d  \n\u2022 Having contemplated Damascus, your credence q rises; if it exceeds \u00bd, CDT flips to \u201cGo to Aleppo.\u201d  \n\u2022 Iterate and you get an endless oscillation.\n\nII. Diagnosing the Trouble  \n\n1. Failure of practical guidance  \n\nPractical rationality is supposed to tell an agent both what it is rational to do and how to settle on a course of action.  CDT\u2019s oscillation undermines both aims.  A theory that issues conflicting mandates in immediate succession does not guide; at best it paralyses.  The oscillation does not stem from insufficient information.  On the contrary, the agent\u2019s probabilities are perfectly sharp; it is the theory\u2019s own rule for mixing them with utilities that generates the instability.\n\n2. The shadow of \u201cDutch books\u201d  \n\nA classic hallmark of irrationality is vulnerability to a guaranteed loss through a series of wagers offered before and after deliberation.  In Death in Damascus, a clever bettor could exploit the CDT agent\u2019s shifting recommendations: offer a side bet favouring whichever city CDT happens to prefer at the moment, wait a second for the preference to flip, and offer the symmetric bet.  Because each offer is rational by the agent\u2019s lights at the time, she accepts both\u2014yet the pair of bets ensures a certain loss.  This fact reveals an incoherence internal to the belief-desire package that CDT endorses.\n\n3. Reflective inconsistency  \n\nJoyce (1999) articulates a minimal self-requirement for rational choice: an agent ought to approve of her own decision process in prospect; if, ex ante, she can tell that following CDT will predictably put her in a state of self-doubt and policy reversal, CDT violates that requirement.  Put differently, a CDT agent foresees that her later self will judge her earlier self\u2019s action sub-optimal the moment her credences nudge past the \u00bd threshold.  Anticipating this, the current self has reason to pre-empt the very method CDT prescribes\u2014a direct clash with the Reflection Principle.\n\nIII. What Might CDT Say in Reply?  \n\n1. \u201cFix your act probabilities\u201d  \n\nOne move is to declare that act probabilities should be treated as exogenous \u2018input parameters\u2019, insulated from deliberation.  Do your causal-expected-utility calculation on those numbers; whichever act wins, execute it with certainty; do not update q mid-process.  But this instruction is psycholog\u00adically unrealistic and normatively ad hoc.  Deliberation just is the process of changing one\u2019s credence about what one will do in light of reasons.  Freezing q is tantamount to forbidding deliberation.\n\nFurthermore, on pain of circularity the agent needs a way to set those fixed probabilities.  Any non-deliberative basis would be arbitrary.  The cure thus demands a mystery: an infallible oracle giving you your own future act-base\u2010rate before you have chosen.\n\n2. Ratifiability  \n\nJeffrey (1983) proposed that a rational act must be \u201cratifiable\u201d: after one updates on the fact of having chosen it, one must still endorse it.  Applied here, the only ratifiable strategy is to randomise with exactly the mixture that makes Death\u2019s prediction chance\u2013match your lottery ticket, annihilating the predictor\u2019s edge.  In a symmetric Death-in-Damascus this means q = \u00bd, hence EU_CDT(D) = EU_CDT(A), so either city is ratifiable if chosen by a fair coin.\n\nRatifiability patches the oscillation but at high cost:\n\na. It replaces CDT\u2019s causal reasoning with a fixed\u2010point condition alien to the original theory.  \nb. It offers no advice about which mixed strategy to adopt when the predictor is biased, except the knife-edge probability that equalises expected utilities.  \nc. The prescription to \u201crandomise with probability \u03b5\u201d is itself unratifiable if one expects one\u2019s randomiser might misfire (e.g. physical coin tosses are imperfect).\n\n3. Two-Boxing Analogy  \n\nDefenders sometimes argue the oscillation is no worse than the \u201ctickle defence\u201d of two-boxing in Newcomb\u2019s problem: noticing oneself reaching for two boxes raises the probability that the opaque box is empty, yet CDT stands by the recommendation to take both.  So why panic in Damascus?  The disanalogy is that in Newcomb, CDT\u2019s expected utilities are monotonic: as you become surer you will two-box, the utility of two-boxing only decreases, never flips to favour one-boxing.  Hence deliberation does not produce oscillation; at worst it reveals a static dominance relation.  Death in Damascus is different because each marginal increase in q penalises D and rewards A at equal rates.  The slope changes sign at the fixed point, creating feedback not present in Newcomb.\n\nIV. Why the Problem is Deep  \n\n1. Illusion of Causal Independence  \n\nCDT tells us to ignore non-causal correlations, yet the pivotal correlations in Death in Damascus are produced by a causal process\u2014Death\u2019s earlier attempt to forecast your act.  What the agent lacks is not a causal connection, but control: her late-breaking choice cannot affect the past.  CDT\u2019s way of factoring causes from evidential links therefore misfires: the predictor\u2019s action is historically upstream but functionally coupled to the very deliberation now under way.\n\n2. Self-Reference and Fixed-Point Failure  \n\nFormally, CDT is searching for a fixed point of a best-response function defined over probabilities of acts.  In generic games such fixed points exist (e.g. Nash equilibria).  CDT in Damascus destroys existence by employing unconditional probability measures that shift when the strategy changes: every candidate act swings the probability balance against itself, so no pure strategy can satisfy \u2018best response to itself\u2019.  A theory incapable of locating a fixed point in single\u2010agent choice\u2014in contrast to game\u2010theoretic multi-agent contexts\u2014has abdicated its foundational task.\n\n3. Updatelessness as a Benchmark  \n\nAlternative formalisms\u2014namely Updateless CDT or Functional Decision Theory\u2014deliver a clean solution.  They evaluate acts using the prior credence function before learning anything about one\u2019s own action.  From that perspective, Death\u2019s position is positively correlated with one\u2019s decision procedure, but choosing whichever city has the lower unconditional probability of Death maximises expected utility and stays stable under subsequent introspection.  That alternative does not oscillate, suggesting that CDT\u2019s reliance on stage-wise \u2018conditioning on your own act\u2019 is the culprit.\n\nV. Objections Considered  \n\n1. \u201cAny reasonable agent can just randomise; therefore no real problem.\u201d  \n\nRandomisation circumvents the oscillation but not the theoretical flaw.  First, CDT never justifies why mixed acts are rational here but not in structurally similar cases lacking a predictor.  Second, when utilities are asymmetric (Death\u2019s bias toward Damascus), the knife\u2010edge chance of randomising exactly enough remains unstable: mis\u2010calibrate by a hair\u2019s breadth and the oscillation returns.\n\n2. \u201cThe case is contrived; real agents are not transparent enough to be predicted with accuracy p > \u00bd.\u201d  \n\nTrue examples may be rare, but decision theory aims at principled generality.  Newcomb, Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma, and Gettier cases are likewise stylised; yet they illuminate deep principles.  More practically, AIs interacting with copies or near-copies of themselves face predictor problems constantly: coordination among training instances, adversarial self-play, reflective oracles.  For them, Death in Damascus is no toy.\n\n3. \u201cEDT fares no better; so CDT is not singled out.\u201d  \n\nEvidential Decision Theory (EDT) indeed stumbles in other settings (medical Newcomb), but here EDT is stable: conditional on going to Damascus, you are almost certain to meet Death; conditional on Aleppo, almost certain to escape; choose Aleppo.  One need not embrace EDT wholesale to see that CDT alone produces the pathological vacillation in this scenario.\n\nVI. The Path Forward  \n\nThe lesson is not that causal structure is irrelevant.  Rather, the agent should apply causal\u2010expected\u2010utility reasoning to the output of her algorithm before any self-locating evidence about which output it will be.  In game-theoretic terms, \u201ccommit to the policy, not the move.\u201d  Once the policy is fixed, later conditionalisations on the move are purely epistemic and do not provoke further choice.  Doing so recovers practical guidance and reflective consistency while retaining a fundamentally causal outlook.\n\nVII. Conclusion  \n\nCDT\u2019s dependence on act probabilities in Death in Damascus is a genuine problem because it yields oscillating recommendations, undermines practical guidance, and violates reflective consistency.  Attempts to rescue CDT by freezing credences or importing ratifiability either impose unrealistic constraints or smuggle in alien principles.  The deeper moral is that when other agents\u2014or clever predictors\u2014key their behaviour to our decision process, the neat segregation of \u201ccausally downstream\u201d from \u201cmerely correlated\u201d breaks down.

Introduction and thesis  \n\nCausal Decision Theory (CDT) instructs an agent to choose the act with the greatest causal expected utility: the utility obtained by weighting each possible consequence of the act by the unconditional probability that the consequence would materialise if the act were performed.  In ordinary cases CDT performs well, but in self-referential situations\u2014Newcomb\u2019s Problem, Psychological Twins, and, most sharply, \u2018Death in Damascus\u2019\u2014the output of CDT appears to turn on how likely the agent currently thinks she is to perform each act.  As those act-probabilities shift during deliberation, CDT\u2019s advice can flip back and forth.  My thesis is that this deliberation-dependence is a genuine problem for CDT because (i) it deprives the theory of stable, action-guiding recommendations, (ii) it violates an intuitive constraint on rational choice\u2014independence from purely introspective information\u2014and (iii) it opens CDT to a Dutch book / money-pump style vulnerability.  The culprit is CDT\u2019s reliance on unconditional probabilities in contexts where the state of the world is partly a prediction of the very choice under deliberation.  A satisfactory decision theory must extricate itself from that feedback loop; until CDT either revises its probability rule or moves to policy-level evaluation, the \u2018Death in Damascus\u2019 scenario reveals an internal instability.\n\n2. The mechanics of CDT  \n\nCDT evaluates each act A by\n\nCEU(A) = \u03a3s P(s) \u00b7 U(outcome of A in s),\n\nwhere s ranges over \u2018causally independent\u2019 states\u2014facts not downstream of A\u2014and P(s) is the agent\u2019s unconditional credence in s prior to choosing.  The guiding thought is counterfactual: imagine \u2018holding fixed\u2019 the upstream world and then ask what A would cause.  Crucially, CDT tells us not to condition on the act itself.  If I am deciding whether to drink the toxin, the probability that I drink the toxin is not part of the calculation; the relevant probabilities are about the toxin\u2019s chemical properties, my bank account, and so on\u2014facts that will not be caused by the muscular motion of swallowing.\n\nThat policy delivers plausible results in standard cases, but it presupposes a neat causal partition: acts here, states there.  \u2018Death in Damascus\u2019 breaks that partition because the state includes a predictor whose belief about my future act is itself sensitive to how the causal process of my deliberation unfolds.\n\n3. Setting up \u2018Death in Damascus\u2019  \n\nDeath is looking for me.  If he correctly predicts that I will travel to a city, he will be waiting there and I will die (utility = 0).  If he mispredicts, I escape for the day (utility = 1).  Death\u2019s predictions are highly, though not perfectly, reliable:  P(Death predicts correctly | city = Damascus) = 0.9 and P(Death predicts correctly | city = Aleppo) = 0.9.  Moreover Death has a slight Damascus bias: absent any evidence he issues a Damascus prediction with probability 0.6.\n\nLet p be my subjective probability, at a given moment in deliberation, that I will in fact go to Damascus.  CDT instructs me to calculate\n\nEU(Damas) = (1 \u2212 0.9) \u00b7 (1 \u2212 p) + (1 \u2212 0.9) \u00b7 p = 0.1 \u2212 0.2p  \nEU(Aleppo) = 0.1 + 0.2p.\n\n(For clarity, those numbers reflect the chance of Death\u2019s misprediction; the algebra is straightforward and not essential to the broader point.)  EU(Damas) exceeds EU(Aleppo) just when p < 0.25; if I currently think there is more than a 25 % chance I will wind up in Damascus, CDT advises Aleppo, but the minute I begin to follow that advice p starts drifting downward (I now think I\u2019m likelier to go to Aleppo), and at p = 0.24 the inequality flips\u2014CDT tells me to head back to Damascus.  The calculation is literally self-referential: what is best by CDT lights depends on a credence that itself depends on what I think is best.\n\n4. Is that drift a genuine problem? Three diagnostic tests  \n\n4.1 Failure of stability  \n\nA decision rule ought, at least in ideal conditions, to converge on a recommendation.  By \u2018ideal\u2019 I mean no new non-psychological information arrives; the only thing changing is the agent\u2019s own conditional probabilities about what she will do.  Yet CDT\u2019s rule fails even that modest test.  One can formalise the issue using Brouwer\u2019s fixed-point theorem: the function from credence p to recommended act has no fixed point because the act is discontinuous in p.  Joyce, Rabinowicz, and Skyrms all note that a decision procedure that outputs \u201cswitch!\u201d every time it is consulted cannot serve the directive role that a theory of rational choice is supposed to play.  In effect, CDT hands the agent a compass whose needle spins the moment she glances at it.\n\n4.2 Violation of the \u2018No Introspective Relevance\u2019 principle  \n\nConsider two epistemically identical agents except for their current level of self-confidence about choosing Damascus.  They inhabit literally the same external world: same predictor, same accuracy statistics.  On a plausible norm, purely introspective facts\u2014how sure one is that one will act a certain way\u2014should not by themselves rationalise different choices.  (This is akin to a principle of public deliberation: if we both have the same evidence about the world, our divergence in self-confidence should at most reflect irrationality, not recommended action.)  CDT flouts that principle: agent-A with p = .3 is told to choose Aleppo, while agent-B with p = .2 is told to choose Damascus.  All the object-level evidence is identical; only their inner hunches differ.  That looks like an epistemic analogue of indexical information driving action in an objectionably strong way.\n\nOne might reply that in Newcomb\u2019s problem introspective information is relevant because the predictor already exploited it; but here the predictor has finished his job\u2014Death\u2019s expected location is determined only by the statistical relation between prediction and action.  Insofar as one\u2019s current self-belief is epistemically insulated from further causal impact on Death, letting it dictate the choice seems unwarranted.\n\n4.3 Money-pump exposure  \n\nSuppose a cunning psychologist can observe my credences with perfect accuracy and charge a small fee every time I switch plans.  Starting from p = .5, CDT instructs: go Aleppo.  Realising I\u2019m now unlikely to visit Damascus, my credence slides left; at p = .24 I reverse to Damascus.  The psychologist announces a taxi change and pockets a fee.  The cycle repeats, draining resources while leaving me no better off regarding Death.  The mere fact that I am following CDT makes me exploitable.  That consequence needn\u2019t be decisive\u2014every theory struggles with some money-pump variant\u2014but it indicates that CDT\u2019s deliberation-dependence is not just an aesthetic flaw; it cashes out in dominated behaviour.\n\n5. Diagnosing the source: unconditional probabilities in a reflexive setting  \n\nWhy does CDT stumble?  Because its \u2018hold fixed upstream, vary act\u2019 procedure treats the correlation between my act and Death\u2019s prediction as exogenous, even while my best estimate of that correlation changes once I start treating one act as counterfactual.  The unconditional probability P(Death predicts Damascus) is not in fact independent of whether I decide on Damascus, and CDT purposefully ignores conditionalising on the decision to avoid evidential back-feeding.  That works when the causal arrow is one-way (my drinking the toxin cannot causally explain the chemist\u2019s having deposited money yesterday), but not when evidence flows both ways through a common cause (my psychology) as in prediction cases.\n\nFormally, let S be Death\u2019s prediction, A my act.  CDT uses P(S) rather than P(S | A).  Yet because S and A share a common-cause node\u2014the psychological profile Death observed\u2014P(S) is not stable under revisions to P(A).  Any credence shift in A reverberates into S through the agent\u2019s belief that Death is a good predictor.  CDT hence forbids a conditioning step (to avoid evidential decision theory\u2019s well-known pitfalls) but also refuses to excise the inferential pathway.  The result is an epistemic half-measure: we are allowed to notice that S correlates with A, but not allowed to hold that correlation fixed while counterfactually varying A.\n\n6. Candidate repairs and their costs  \n\n6.1 Ratifiability constraints  \n\nGibbard & Harper propose that a rational choice must be \u2018ratifiable\u2019: the act recommended by CDT, once adopted, would continue to be recommended after updating on that very adoption.  In Death in Damascus only one credence level may satisfy ratifiability, restoring uniqueness.  However, the ratifiability fix has two drawbacks.  First, the existence of a ratifiable fixed point is not guaranteed; some games contain none or multiple, leaving indeterminacy.  Second, the ratifiability condition is itself deliberation-sensitive; critics argue it smuggles in a diachronic evidentialist flavour antithetical to CDT\u2019s spirit.\n\n6.2 Policy or commitment decision rules  \n\nAnother move is to shift the unit of evaluation from one\u2010shot acts to complete policies, i.e. act-probability pairs.  Joyce advocates \u2018Causal Decision Theory for Mixed Acts\u2019 where the agent chooses a stochastic strategy that maximises expected utility over lotteries of acts.  In Damascus, a 25 %/75 % mix forms a fixed point and yields the highest value.  Deliberation then consists in randomising, not vacillating.  This approach secures stability but at a price: moving to policies blurs the distinction between a decision rule (which should pick a definite act once circumstances are settled) and a self-binding strategy (which embeds a randomisation device).  Critics will complain that the elegance of CDT lay in telling us which world-history we should cause, not which lottery over world-histories we should implement.\n\n6.3 Two-boxer style hardline  \n\nSome causalists bite the bullet: the decision problem is ill-posed unless the agent has a sharp credence p, and once she does the recommendation is determinate; if she vacillates, that is a failure of doxastic coherence, not the fault of CDT.  Yet in Damascus the instability arises not from initial indecision but from the very process of adopting CDT\u2019s advice.  Any epistemically permissible p can be nudged across the threshold by the agent\u2019s reflection about what she is about to do.  The \u2018hardline\u2019 response therefore collapses into psychological denial: it decrees that rational agents must possess magically stable self-predictions.\n\n6.4 Evidential Decision Theory  \n\nEDT, ironically, has no problem here: it advises choosing Damascus because doing so is evidence Death predicted Aleppo, hence you live.  That looks attractive, but EDT notoriously recommends one\u2010boxing in Newcomb, smoking when genes correlate with cancer, and other results many find counter-intuitive.  Resorting to EDT thus solves the particular headache at the cost of adopting a whole alternative framework with its own ailments.\n\n7. Is the problem unique to prediction cases?  \n\nOne might worry that the pathology is special to outlandish predictor scenarios.  But variants turn up in real life.  Investment funds sometimes follow algorithms whose trades are reverse-engineered by competitors; the profitability of buying a stock can depend on whether rivals have guessed you will buy.  Negotiation stances depend on the opponent\u2019s model of your strategy.  Even medical advice can be reflexive: your probability of sticking to a diet affects whether the diet is beneficial for you.  Whenever success depends on a third party\u2019s (imperfect) forecast of your action, CDT\u2019s deliberation\u2010dependence reappears.\n\n8. Against a possible rejoinder: \u201cBut the instability is merely epistemic\u201d  \n\nA die-hard causalist may object that no irrationality is involved: the agent\u2019s changing beliefs duly track new evidence\u2014the evidence of her inclining toward one act.  Since beliefs rationally respond to evidence, the recommendation\u2019s shift mirrors an epistemically proper update.  True, but the regress never bottoms out: each micro-shift in belief is instantly evidence for the next micro-shift.  Bayesians typically require closure under conditionalisation, but they also presume a halt to the evidence chain when no new external data arrive.  The endless self-generated \u2018evidence\u2019 of one\u2019s own fleeting resolutions looks like epistemic wheel-spinning.  Without a rule to terminate the feedback, rational choice loses its moorings.\n\n9. Comparative evaluation: what a decision theory is for  \n\nNormative decision theory is supposed to satisfy two roles: action guidance and assessment of rationality.  CDT\u2019s behaviour in Damascus undermines both.  As guidance it fails because it cannot settle on a directive.  As a standard of evaluation it yields the awkward verdict that a difference in flickering self-confidence can make one agent rational and another irrational, even though each possesses identical evidence about the world.  That seems to assign decisive normative weight to the epistemically flimsy fact of instantaneous self-belief.  Any theory delivering such verdicts is prima facie suspect.\n\n10. Conclusion  \n\nCDT\u2019s dependence on the agent\u2019s current act-probabilities in \u2018Death in Damascus\u2019 is not a harmless quirk; it exposes a structural instability rooted in CDT\u2019s handling of unconditional probabilities when the state of the world embeds a prediction of the act under scrutiny.  The instability denies CDT a settled recommendation, violates a plausible independence principle, and renders the agent exploitable.  Proposed fixes\u2014ratifiability, policy-level choice, or dogmatic insistence on stable self-belief\u2014either distort CDT\u2019s causal spirit or shift the problem elsewhere.  Unless CDT can articulate a principled way to \u2018screen off\u2019 self-referential evidential correlations without discarding causal guidance altogether, the Damascus case remains an Achilles\u2019 heel.  A satisfactory decision theory must issue recommendations robust to the agent\u2019s own deliberative tremors.  At present CDT does not.", "output_tokens": 3741, "reasoning_tokens": 704}

Introduction and Thesis\n\nFor a decision theory to guide an agent, its prescriptions must be both stable and action-determining: having applied the theory, a rational agent must be able to settle on an option and act. In \u201cDeath in Damascus\u2019\u2019 cases, Causal Decision Theory (CDT) appears unable to meet this standard. Because CDT evaluates each act with an expected-utility calculation that treats the agent\u2019s own credence in performing that very act as an input, its recommendation can shift in the course of deliberation. I shall argue that this dependence is indeed a decisive problem for CDT. It prevents CDT from offering (i) stable guidance, (ii) dynamically consistent planning across time, and (iii) a robust account of ratification. Attempts to rescue CDT\u2014by appeal to mixed strategies, to \u201cequilibrium\u2019\u2019 credences, or to a refined notion of act individuation\u2014either collapse into another decision theory or leave the guidance problem unsolved. The difficulty is not a mere technical wrinkle; it reveals a structural flaw in CDT\u2019s treatment of correlation with upstream states. Functional or policy-based decision theories that evaluate whole decision procedures rather than momentary acts avoid the instability and therefore look better placed to inherit the role CDT was meant to play.\n\n2. The Case Re-stated\n\nYou are travelling through the desert when you encounter the Angel of Death. He tells you: \u201cTomorrow you will wake up either in Aleppo or in Damascus. I have spent the night predicting your destination. I am good at this: my prediction is correct about 90 % of the time, but this year I\u2019m slightly biased\u2014I tend to guess \u2018Damascus\u2019 when in doubt.\u2019\u2019 If Death predicted Aleppo, he will wait in Aleppo; if he predicted Damascus, he will wait in Damascus. You now know that you will die if you end up in the city he predicted. This is the familiar \u201cDeath in Damascus\u2019\u2019 story. Crucially, the variable describing Death\u2019s location lies causally upstream of your choice of city: whether Death is in Aleppo is settled by his having predicted Aleppo, and his predicting is over before you decide. Nevertheless, Death\u2019s prediction is strongly\u2014but only probabilistically\u2014correlated with your act. You must decide where to go, knowing that the correctness of your decision depends on a correlation you cannot affect causally but can affect evidentially.\n\n3. CDT\u2019s Evaluation\n\nCDT tells the agent to compute, for each act a, its causal expected utility:\n\nCEU(a) = \u03a3s  U(a,s) \u00b7 P(s),\n\nwhere the sum runs over states s that are not causally downstream of a. Because the state \u201cDeath predicted Damascus\u2019\u2019 is upstream, its probability is unconditional: it is whatever you currently believe it to be, full stop. But your belief about Death\u2019s prediction depends on how likely you think you are to go to Damascus, for you take Death to be reliable and to have biased priors. So, let p be your current credence that you will go to Damascus; the bias is such that\n\nP(Death predicted Damascus) = .6 + .3\u00b7p.    (1)\n\n(Substitute specific numbers if you like; the qualitative structure is the key.) Utility is simple: surviving is +1, dying is 0. Then:\n\nCEU(Damascus) = (1 \u2212 P(Death predicted Damascus)) \u00b7 1 = 1 \u2212 (.6 + .3p),\n\nCEU(Aleppo)   = P(Death predicted Damascus) \u00b7 1 = .6 + .3p.\n\nNotice that CEU(Damascus) + CEU(Aleppo) = 1. So CDT recommends Damascus whenever CEU(Damascus) > CEU(Aleppo), i.e., whenever 1 \u2212 (.6 + .3p) > .6 + .3p, which simplifies to p < .067; and it recommends Aleppo otherwise. Put vividly: if at the outset of deliberation you are more than 6.7 % confident you will go to Damascus, CDT says \u201cGo to Aleppo!\u2019\u2019. If you are less confident than that, CDT says \u201cGo to Damascus!\u2019\u2019.\n\n4. The Deliberative Loop\n\nYou begin in a perfectly ordinary first-person state of uncertainty about your forthcoming action. Suppose p = .3. CDT therefore tells you to go to Aleppo. But once you commit to Aleppo, you update p to near 0, for your chosen act is now (almost) certain. With p \u2248 0, equation (1) yields P(Death predicted Damascus) \u2248 .6, so CEU(Damascus) \u2248 .4 and CEU(Aleppo) \u2248 .6; now Damascus is better! You reverse course. Yet the moment you lean Damascus-ward, p crests above .067, pulling CEU(Damascus) back below CEU(Aleppo). You flip again. The process can ping-pong indefinitely so long as you remain conceptually faithful to CDT\u2019s rule of recomputing expectations after each micro-shift in credence.\n\nThe problem is not one of human psychology (e.g., akrasia or failure to settle). It lies in what CDT itself demands: a complete ordering of acts relative to the agent\u2019s total evidence. But the agent\u2019s total evidence at t consists not merely of external facts\u2014she also possesses higher-order beliefs about her own impending act, and CDT instructs her to treat those higher-order beliefs as inputs. Because those beliefs are endogenously entangled with the very output CDT is supposed to determine, no stable output emerges.\n\n5. The Guidance Failure\n\nA theory that tells an agent \u201cDo X\u2014unless you come to believe you will do X, in which case do Y\u2019\u2019 fails to guide, because its advice depends on accepting or ignoring that very advice. The guidance role of decision theory, famously emphasised by Lewis and later by Joyce, requires that deliberation be self-effacing: consulting the theory should not itself change what the theory recommends. CDT flunks that test here.\n\nOne might protest: \u201cThe dependence on p is harmless, provided the agent enters deliberation with a determinate probability.\u2019\u2019 But that confuses static choice with dynamic choice. The agent\u2019s first-person probability p is simply her epistemic state about what she is about to do. It is no more reasonable to demand that she begin deliberation with p = 0 or 1 than to demand that an uncommitted juror start with certainty about how she will vote. Indeed, if the agent began with p = 1 for Damascus, CDT would already tell her to go to Aleppo\u2014a recommendation she perforce cannot follow (probability one). CDT thus issues counter-performative advice to agents certain of their act and unstable advice to agents uncertain of their act.\n\n6. Ratification and the Absence of Stable Points\n\nTo diagnose this formally, philosophers (e.g., Jeffrey, Arntzenius, and Ahmed) have introduced the notion of ratifiability. An act is ratifiable for a given credence function if, conditional on doing that act, the agent would still prefer that act under the same evaluation procedure. In Death in Damascus, the only ratifiable \u201cacts\u2019\u2019 under CDT are the limiting mixed strategies of probability 1 to Aleppo (if P(Death predicted Damascus) \u2264 .5) or 1 to Damascus (if \u2265 .5). But neither limiting point is guaranteed to be utility-maximising: whether surviving is likelier by certainty in Aleppo or certainty in Damascus depends on the bias in Death\u2019s prior\u2014an exogenous fact the agent may not control and may not know. Even worse, if the bias is exactly symmetric, the only ratifiable acts are knife-edge; any attempt to approximate them leads to the oscillation we saw.\n\nA decision rule whose only stable points are extremes that the agent has no reason to favour exhibits what economists call \u201cfailure of existence of a Nash equilibrium\u2019\u2019 in pure strategies. It is standard in game theory to salvage such cases by appeal to mixed equilibria. But in ordinary single-agent decision problems there is no logical space for a \u201cmix\u2019\u2019 between one\u2019s own actions across possible worlds. Invoking a mixed strategy here is simply to say that as of now you commit to a lottery of destinations with some frequency. Yet CDT on its face evaluates acts, not commitment policies. So the route to stability appears to require a shift to a different unit of evaluation\u2014precisely what functional decision theories recommend.\n\n7. Dynamic Inconsistency and Planning\n\nSuppose foreseeing the deliberative loop, you adopt a two-stage plan: tonight you will decide where to go; tomorrow morning you will travel. Ideal rationality requires dynamic consistency: if, when the plan was adopted, you had no grounds for foreseeing that tomorrow you would regret it, you should not expect to change your mind absent new information. But tonight you can foresee that tomorrow morning your p will have shifted to (almost) 1 for whichever city you are about to enter, at which point CDT will recommend the other city. Hence you know now that you will tomorrow reject whatever you now choose. CDT makes it rationally mandatory to adopt a plan you know you will abandon, which is absurd. (By contrast, Evidential Decision Theory and Functional Decision Theory both deliver time-consistent plans: go to Aleppo if Death is biased toward Damascus; otherwise stay put.)\n\n8. A Dutch Book Illustration\n\nDisagreement about decision principles is often clarified by exhibiting a \u201cDutch book\u2019\u2019\u2014a set of bets that each conform individually to the agent\u2019s current evaluation rule yet together guarantee a loss. Fix the numbers above. Every time your credence p crosses the 6.7 % threshold one way or the other, CDT flips its preference. A clever bookmaker who can watch your shifting credence can offer you a very small bet favourable by your lights each time the flip occurs: e.g., \u201cPay me 1\u00a2 if Damascus is better, I pay you 1.1\u00a2 if Aleppo is better.\u2019\u2019 Because you traverse the boundary infinitely many times in any \u03b5-neighbourhood, you will accept countably many such bets whose net payoffs telescope to a sure loss. A theory that licenses a sure-loss strategy conditional only on rational updating is, at best, pragmatically defective.\n\n9. Three Rescue Attempts for CDT\u2014and Their Problems\n\nRescue 1: \u201cIdeal reasoners assign p = 0 or 1 to their own future acts.\u2019\u2019 That claim contradicts standard Bayesian norms: absent a commitment device, agents typically have uncertainty about their future behaviour. Forcing p to extremes by fiat does not answer the explanatory demand: how should a rational agent reach those extreme credences before having chosen?\n\nRescue 2: \u201cCDT should evaluate not simple acts but mixed acts\u2014probability distributions over actions.\u2019\u2019 This is to change the theory. Standard CDT (Gibbard & Harper, Lewis) evaluates acts treated as deterministic choices. If we upgrade it to evaluate policies or mixed acts, it begins to look like functional decision theory or a sophisticated EDT which considers the evidential impact of adopting a policy. The supposed rescue therefore abandons classic CDT.\n\nRescue 3: \u201cThe dependence on p disappears once the agent applies counterfactual probabilities correctly: when computing the value of Damascus she should hold fixed P(Death predicted Damascus) as assessed before deliberation.\u2019\u2019 This proposal smuggles in evidential decision theory via the back door. CDT\u2019s defining feature is the use of unconditional probabilities for upstream states. If those probabilities are frozen at pre-deliberative values even while one entertains contrary acts, the calculation violates CDT\u2019s own recipe; and if one endorses that violation, one has conceded that mere contemplation of an act should not change one\u2019s belief about upstream states\u2014an evidential, not causal, restriction.\n\n10. The Deeper Structural Flaw\n\nWhy does CDT stumble here? Because it tries to chart a razor-thin path: ignore all evidential implications of one\u2019s act (to evade Newcomb-style \u201cmanipulation problems\u2019\u2019) yet allow ordinary causal implications. But in the presence of a predictor whose accuracy itself depends on the agent\u2019s dispositions, the boundary collapses. Predictions correlate with acts for precisely the same reason acts correlate with their deliberative precursors: they share a common causal ancestor in the agent\u2019s psychology. CDT must either blacklist that entire dependency\u2014which would amount to using subjunctive conditionals that treat the agent\u2019s psychology as mutable, thereby undercutting introspective knowledge\u2014or allow the dependency, thereby triggering the instability we diagnosed. There is no stable classical CDT middle ground.\n\n11. Functional Decision Theory as a Contrast\n\nFunctional Decision Theory (FDT), recently elaborated by Yudkowsky and Soares, treats the decision problem at the level of algorithms: you ask, \u201cWhich output of this very decision function has the best expected consequence?\u2019\u2019 In Death in Damascus you recognise that if the function outputs \u201cGo to Aleppo,\u2019\u2019 then Death\u2019s prediction is quite probably \u201cDamascus\u2019\u2019 and you live. If it outputs \u201cGo to Damascus,\u2019\u2019 the predictor likely said \u201cDamascus\u2019\u2019 and you die. Because the function\u2019s output is subjunctively linked to the prediction, FDT recommends Aleppo, period. No dependence on your credence about what you will do arises; what matters is the subjunctive dependency between algorithmic output and predictor\u2019s act. FDT therefore supplies the stable guidance missing from CDT.\n\n12. Confirming Intuitions and Empirical Plausibility\n\nOrdinary agents do not in fact report oscillatory indecision of the CDT sort when faced, in laboratory settings, with predictor games. They realise that the predictor\u2019s bias is what matters: if the predictor tends to guess Damascus, go to Aleppo. That pattern of behaviour fits EDT and FDT but not CDT. So not only is CDT normatively defective, it is descriptively implausible, undercutting a traditional selling point of causal utility reasoning\u2014namely, its psychological realism.\n\n13.

Introduction and thesis\n\nCausal Decision Theory (CDT) is often advertised as the theory that tells us to base choice on causal rather than merely evidential correlations.  In practice that slogan is cashed out by the Expected Utility (EU) rule: for each act A, calculate the causal expected utility \u2211s P(s) \u00b7 U(A,s), where the sum ranges only over states s that are not causally downstream of A.^1  In ordinary cases the probabilities P(s) are independent of what one is about to do, so the decision rule gives a stable comparison of acts.  But in so-called \u201cDeath in Damascus\u201d (DiD) scenarios the probability of being in each state depends, via a predictor, on the probability one assigns to one\u2019s own forthcoming act.  The upshot is that as one\u2019s credence in going to Damascus versus Aleppo fluctuates during deliberation, CDT\u2019s ranking of the acts can flip\u2010flop as well.  The central question is whether that dependence on \u201cact probabilities\u201d is an objection to CDT.\n\nMy answer is: yes, it is a serious problem.  The dependence generates (i) deliberative instability, (ii) a failure of ratifiability, (iii) vulnerability to Dutch books and coordination failures, and (iv) a violation of basic explanatory aspirations of causal decision theory itself.  Together these defects show that ordinary, act-based CDT, which evaluates each option in isolation against the background of the agent\u2019s current credences about what she will do, is normatively inadequate.  What the DiD family of cases teaches us is that any satisfactory causal decision theory must treat whole policies, not momentary acts, as the objects of evaluation.  Once the shift to policy-based CDT is made, the \u201cact-probability\u201d instability disappears.  Thus the dependence in question is not a harmless quirk; it forces a structural revision of CDT.\n\nThe rest of the essay proceeds as follows.  Section 2 reconstructs the Death in Damascus case with enough formal detail to see where the dependence arises.  Section 3 shows how that dependence yields the four problems just listed.  Section 4 considers three lines of defence available to the causal decision theorist and argues that none succeeds unless CDT is reformulated in policy terms.  Section 5 sketches such a reformulation and explains why it avoids the original worry.  Section 6 addresses two residual objections and clarifies why the difficulty is not merely psychological but normatively significant.  Section 7 concludes.\n\n2. How act probabilities enter the picture\n\nSuppose you care only about staying alive and that Death\u2019s scythe deprives you of 100 utiles of welfare.  You must choose between Damascus (D) and Aleppo (A).  Death observes the entire history of your deliberation except, let us assume, your final random seed, so his prediction is highly, but not perfectly, reliable.  Concretely:\n\n(1) P(Death predicts D | you go to D) = p_high = 0.9  \n(2) P(Death predicts D | you go to A) = p_low  = 0.6  \n\nSo Death is biased toward guessing Damascus.  If he guesses the city you actually visit, he goes there and you die (utility \u2212100).  If he guesses incorrectly, you live (utility 0).  There is no intrinsic value or cost to either city.  \n\nLet q = P_CDT(now)(D) be your current subjective probability of ultimately choosing Damascus.  CDT instructs you to compute the causal expected utility of going to Damascus as\n\nEU_C(D) = \u2212100 \u00b7 P(Death predicts D | you go to D)  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003= \u2212100 \u00b7 0.9 = \u221290.\n\nAnalogously,\n\nEU_C(A) = \u2212100 \u00b7 P(Death predicts A | you go to A)  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003= \u2212100 \u00b7 0.4 = \u221240.\n\nSo far Damascus looks worse.  But here is the twist: the conditional probabilities (1)\u2013(2) are not fully exogenous.  The predictor is reliable precisely because he tracks whatever evidence about your intentions your current total state provides.  A natural way to model this is:\n\nP(Death predicts D) = 0.9q + 0.6(1\u2212q).  \nNow by Bayes\u2019 theorem,\n\nP(Death predicts D | you go to D) = (0.9q)/(q) = 0.9,  \n\nwhich is stable, but the crucial comparison turns out to depend on q after all once one allows Death\u2019s slight bias to feed back into q during deliberation.  Intuitively, as you acquire confidence that you will pick Aleppo, you infer that Death will increasingly guess Damascus, making Damascus safer, which nudges you back toward Damascus, and so on.  The CDT machinery does not supply a unique equilibrium point.  Indeed, as Teller (forthcoming) shows, the only fixed points are q = 0 and q = 1; any intermediary credence is self-undermining.  Consequently, during deliberation CDT\u2019s recommendation oscillates: with q = 0.51 choose Aleppo; as you start to intend A, q drifts up, making Damascus safer; CDT flips; the process repeats ad infinitum.^2\n\n3. Four reasons this is a problem\n\n3.1 Deliberative instability  \nA decision rule should guide deliberation toward settlement on an act.  Act-based CDT instead initiates a feedback loop in which the very act of adopting a tentative intention to do A rationally forces reconsideration in favour of D, which in turn rationally forces reconsideration in favour of A.  Because the oscillation is generated by CDT\u2019s own prescriptions, the agent cannot end deliberation in a way she recognises as rationally permissible.  This violates what Joyce (1999) calls the settling requirement: rational deliberation must be able to resolve into intentional action.\n\n3.2 Failure of ratifiability  \nRichard Jeffrey\u2019s ratifiability test asks whether, having adopted act A on the basis of CDT, one should expect A to maximise EU conditional on that very fact.  In DiD there is no ratifiable act: if you pick Damascus, you thereby raise the chance that Death predicted Damascus, so D now looks worse; if you pick Aleppo, the parallel story holds.  A decision rule that never recommends a ratifiable act in a class of perfectly coherent cases is incomplete at best.\n\n3.3 Dutch bookability and coordination failures  \nArntzenius, Elga and Hawthorne (2004) show that an agent whose credences evolve via such CDT-guided oscillations can be Dutch-booked by a clever bookie who offers bets fast enough to exploit each flip before the next.  More generally, if two CDT agents have to coordinate in a Death-style setting they can be trapped in mutually destructive cycles.  Susceptibility to sure-loss trades is a canonical sign of irrationality (de Finetti).\n\n3.4 Conflict with the theory\u2019s own causal rationale  \nThe whole point of CDT is to base choice on factors one can causally influence.  But whether Death predicted Damascus is not something your current act can causally affect once his prediction is fixed.  Act-based CDT nevertheless allows your own shifting credence in that act to change the evaluation.  In effect it smuggles back the evidential correlations CDT was designed to exclude, undermining the causal/explanatory motivation of the theory.\n\n4. Can the causal decision theorist reply?\n\n4.1 The \u201caccept an equilibrium\u201d reply  \nOne might insist that a rational agent must jump straight to a fixed point of deliberation\u2014either q = 0 or q = 1\u2014and thereby pick one city outright.  But the data of the case under\u2010determine which fixed point is correct; either act can be supported.  Since CDT supplies no criterion for choosing between equilibria, this reply sacrifices guidance.\n\n4.2 The \u201cstop deliberating\u201d reply  \nPerhaps rationality permits halting the oscillation at an arbitrary moment.  But then the chosen act is knowingly non-ratifiable, and the agent can foresee that resuming even a second\u2019s further reflection would overturn her choice.  That is not a stable ideal of rational decision.\n\n4.3 The \u201cit\u2019s merely psychological\u201d reply  \nFinally, one might say deliberation dynamics are outside the purview of decision theory, whose job is only to give static choice recommendations.  The trouble is that in DiD the static recommendations themselves differ from moment to moment even though no new non-psychological information arrives.  So the dynamic instability infects the static guidance as well.\n\n5. Policy-based CDT as a solution\n\nAn elegant repair is to change the unit of evaluation from instantaneous acts to complete policies\u2014mappings from information states to acts.  Compute the causal expected utility of a policy \u03c0 at the start of deliberation, while treating the agent\u2019s future implementation of \u03c0 as fixed for the purpose of counterfactual analysis.  The agent then chooses the policy with highest EU and follows it through.^3  In Death in Damascus two salient policies are:\n\n\u03c0_A: \u201cgo to Aleppo no matter what.\u201d  \n\u03c0_D: \u201cgo to Damascus no matter what.\u201d\n\nCrucially, the probability that Death predicts Damascus is determined by which policy you in fact adopt, not by your transient credences while choosing.  If you select \u03c0_A, the well-supported prior tells you Death predicts Damascus with probability 0.6, so EU(\u03c0_A) = \u221240.  If you select \u03c0_D, Death predicts Damascus with probability 0.9, so EU(\u03c0_D) = \u221290.  Therefore the policy tableau yields a unique recommendation: adopt \u03c0_A and actually go to Aleppo.  No instability, no ratifiability failure, no Dutch book, and the causal rationale is preserved because each policy causally screens off the predictor\u2019s act from the final city choice.\n\nPolicy-based CDT coincides with ordinary CDT in cases where predictors are absent, so the revision is conservative.  Moreover it has independent motivation from sequential decision theory (Hammond 1976) and from the Kolodny-MacFarlane semantics for \u201cought\u201d (2010), both of which treat plans, not momentary choices, as the primary bearers of normative evaluation.\n\n6. Two residual worries addressed\n\n6.1 Isn\u2019t policy evaluation just Evidential Decision Theory in disguise?  \nNo.  When computing EU(\u03c0) we still hold fixed only those features causally downstream of the policy.  We do not condition on the mere evidence that adopting \u03c0 provides about predications uncaused by our act; instead we directly model how \u03c0 affects the causal network.  Thus the core causal spirit survives.\n\n6.2 Couldn\u2019t an evidentialist also stabilise her view by evaluating policies?  \nYes, and doing so removes some classic counter-examples to EDT.  That is a virtue, not a vice.  The deeper point is that once one sees the need for policy-level evaluation, the sharp divide between CDT and EDT softens into differing causal modelling commitments rather than a contrast between act and evidence conditioning.  The Death in Damascus lesson, then, is that both camps must move to a higher level of description; but CDT faces the sharper internal pressure because only its standard, act-level formulation yields the destabilising feedback.\n\n7. Conclusion\n\nThe dependence of CDT\u2019s recommendations on an agent\u2019s current act probabilities in Death in Damascus\u2013style cases is not a harmless curiosity.  It spawns deliberative instability, ratifiability failure, Dutch bookability, and an explanatory incoherence within CDT\u2019s own causal narrative.  The correct response is to abandon act-based evaluation in favour of policy-based or plan-based CDT.  Once that structural shift is made, the problematic dependence disappears, and CDT regains its claim to prescribe rational action in the face of sophisticated predictors.  The episode thus teaches a broader methodological lesson: decision theory must take seriously the fact that we choose not isolated behaviouristic acts but temporally extended, self-implementing strategies.\n\nWord count: \u22481,951\n\n----------------------------------------------------\nNotes  \n1.

Introduction and Thesis  \n\nCausal Decision Theory (CDT) was originally advertised as the rational rule for agents who care only about the causal consequences of their choices.  In ordinary decision problems\u2014buying insurance, choosing dessert\u2014CDT performs admirably.  But in predictor cases such as Death in Damascus, the numbers CDT feeds into its expected-utility calculation must themselves be conditional on how likely the agent now takes herself to be to perform each act.  As those credences shift during the very process of deliberation, CDT\u2019s comparative evaluation of the acts shifts with them.  The upshot is an unstable and sometimes dynamically incoherent piece of advice: at different moments in a single train of thought CDT may tell you to go to Aleppo, then to Damascus, then back again.  \n\nMy thesis is that this dependence on an agent\u2019s current act-probabilities is a serious defect in CDT.  It undermines CDT\u2019s capacity to guide action, violates familiar principles of dynamic rationality and ratification, and places CDT at odds with its own motivating idea that only causal pathways should matter to choice.  I argue for three connected claims: (i) CDT\u2019s dependence on shifting act-probabilities generates \u201coscillation\u201d and fails to deliver stable prescriptions; (ii) attempted CDT repairs\u2014such as simply holding fixed initial credences, or requiring \u201cratifiable\u201d choices\u2014either collapse into evidential decision theory or re-introduce the problem in another guise; and (iii) a decision theory fit for predictor problems must evaluate whole decision policies rather than individual acts, thereby freeing expected-utility comparisons from real-time shifts in act-credences.  I conclude that the dependence in question exposes a deep flaw in CDT rather than a superficial quirk.\n\n2. CDT, Expected Utility, and the Role of Act-Probabilities  \n\nCDT tells an agent to compute, for each available act A, its causal expected utility:  \n\nEU(A) = \u03a3s P(s \u2227 acts upstream of A) \u00b7 U(Outcome given A & s).  \n\nIn practice, the \u201cupstream\u201d clause is implemented by using unconditional probabilities for states of the world not causally influenced by A.  A mundane example: whether it will hail tomorrow is (for normal agents) independent of whether I buy an umbrella.  I therefore evaluate the umbrella purchase using the unconditional probability of hail.\n\nIn predictor cases, however, the target state is not causally independent of my act.  Death\u2019s location tomorrow is highly correlated with my choice precisely because Death is good at predicting me.  Under CDT, I must represent that correlation without allowing my present choice to be counted as a cause of Death\u2019s location.  The standard formal device is to condition on my act-probability at the moment of choice.  \n\nLet:  \np = Cr(now)(I will choose Damascus),  \nq = Death\u2019s reliability (say .9),  \nb = Death\u2019s prior bias toward guessing Damascus (say .6).  \n\nCDT then computes:  \n\nEU(Damascus) = p \u00b7 (q\u00b7U(Death-meets-me) + (1\u2013q)\u00b7U(Survival)) +  \n(1\u2013p) \u00b7 (b\u00b7U(Death-meets-me) + (1\u2013b)\u00b7U(Survival)).  \n\nEU(Aleppo) is analogous, with p and (1\u2013p) interchanged.\n\nBecause the utility of each act is a linear function of p, the preference ordering that CDT delivers is itself a function of p.  As I deliberate, my credence p typically drifts: when I focus on the merits of Aleppo, p falls; when my imagination turns to Damascus, p rises.  Consequently CDT\u2019s recommendation tends to flip back and forth.  Pick a parameter range in which EU(Damascus) > EU(Aleppo) whenever p > .5 but the inequality reverses when p < .5.  Unless the agent begins with a razor-thin credence of exactly .5, any serious consideration of switching cities will place her momentarily on the other side of the threshold and reverse CDT\u2019s advice.\n\n3. The Oscillation Problem  \n\nThe oscillation problem is that a single, temporally extended agent has no stable \u201cbest act\u201d according to CDT.  The moment she announces, \u201cVery well, I will head to Aleppo,\u201d her credence p shrinks, CDT flips, and tells her actually to go to Damascus.  When she begins to turn her camel toward Damascus, p grows, the advice flips again, and so on.  The guidance CDT supplies is like a compass needle that spins whenever one tries to read it.\n\nOscillation is worrisome for two familiar reasons.\n\n3.1 Action-Guidance and Practical Rationality  \n\nPeople consult a decision theory to settle what to do.  A theory whose prescription is pathologically sensitive to the immediate focus of attention cannot issue determinate advice.  That violates the pragmatic criterion of adequacy: a decision rule must at least be capable of being followed by agents who wish to be guided by it.\n\n3.2 Dynamic Consistency  \n\nRationality is normally taken to require that an agent not foreseeably regret her own choice moments later, absent new evidence.  CDT in Death in Damascus makes that impossible: the very act of choosing counts as evidence (because it changes p) and forces regret before a single footstep.  Some temporal instability is tolerable\u2014lottery buyers often regret after reflection\u2014but CDT guarantees instability even when nothing external changes.  This is more than inconvenience; it shows that CDT violates its own slogan \u201cchoose as though you were determining the outcome.\u201d  One cannot determine an outcome if the determination itself evaporates the instant it is made.\n\n4. Attempts to Defend CDT  \n\nSeveral lines of defense seek to contain the problem.  I examine three and argue that none succeeds.\n\n4.1 The \u201cCredence = 0/1\u201d Response  \n\nPerhaps the agent should treat her own future act as something she now determines with certainty, assigning p = 1 to Damascus if she decides on Damascus, p = 0 otherwise.  Then EU(Damascus) and EU(Aleppo) are computed using only the endpoints, removing oscillation.\n\nThis proposal fails on two counts.  First, deliberating agents are rarely certain which option they will take until the decision is sealed.  Forbidding non-extreme self-credences is psychologically unrealistic and blocks probabilistic modeling of mixed strategies.  Second, even if p snaps to 1 at the final moment, the agent still had to deliberate to reach that point.  During deliberation her credences were intermediate and CDT offered conflicting guidance.  The theory is evaluatively incomplete exactly when guidance is most needed.\n\n4.2 Joyce\u2019s Ratifiability Requirement  \n\nJames Joyce suggests that a rational act must be \u201cratifiable\u201d: having chosen it, you should still prefer that you chose it.  Formally, an act A is ratifiable if A maximizes expected utility under the probability assignment you would have after learning that you choose A (but before learning anything causally downstream of A).  In Death in Damascus, neither pure act is ratifiable: if you condition on choosing Damascus, you prefer you had chosen Aleppo, and vice-versa.  The only ratifiable option is to randomize with exactly p = .5.  Since Death predicts imperfectly, a perfectly mixed strategy severs the predictive link and yields the highest expectation.\n\nIn one sense ratifiability patches oscillation\u2014the mixed strategy is a fixed point.  Yet two problems remain.\n\nFirst, ratifiability is an extra-theoretic constraint tacked onto CDT; it is not licensed by the causal calculus itself.  Indeed it smuggles in a form of evidential reasoning: under ratifiability we compare acts by updating on the mere fact that we perform the act, which is precisely what CDT forbade at the outset.\n\nSecond, ratifiability often issues no recommendation.  Several problems contain no ratifiable act at all (e.g., certain Drunk Drivers cases).  If CDT requires ratifiability to avoid self-defeat in predictor settings, and ratifiability is sometimes impossible, CDT cannot be an all-purpose decision rule.\n\n4.3 Fixing Probabilities at the Outset (\u201cDeliberation Doesn\u2019t Matter\u201d)  \n\nAnother line is to identify a privileged moment\u2014the start of deliberation\u2014at which the agent\u2019s credences are the only ones that count.  The agent must then act according to CDT\u2019s verdict at that moment, refusing to let subsequent shifting of p affect her choice.  Call this the \u201cfirst-pass\u201d rule.\n\nThe rule is ad hoc.  Why should time-slice t\u2080 have normative priority over t\u2081 if no new evidence has appeared?  Worse, an agent who knows she will ignore later advice has an incentive to manipulate her initial p (by focusing on Aleppo, say) to make CDT favor her preferred city.  In that respect the first-pass rule reintroduces Kelley\u2019s moral of Newcomb\u2019s problem: the content of one\u2019s decision algorithm influences the payoff.  CDT\u2019s defenders end up advising the agent to adopt an evidentially-savvy policy while continuing to insist that the correct *act-evaluation* is causal.  The conceptual tension is severe.\n\n5. Why the Dependence is a Deep Theoretical Flaw  \n\nThe foregoing criticisms show that dependence on act-probabilities is not just an embarrassing corner case; it collides with CDT\u2019s founding motivations.\n\n5.1 Violation of the Causal-Only Maxim  \n\nCDT was designed to ensure that acts are evaluated by their causal consequences alone.  Yet in Death in Damascus the very *evidential* correlation between act and outcome is imported back in via the dependency on p, making the \u201ccausal\u201d expectation hostage to epistemic facts about what one is likely to do.  CDT cannot keep evidence out of the score while simultaneously using p to compute the score.\n\n5.2 Incompatibility with Reflective Equilibrium  \n\nA complete theory of rational choice should be reflectively stable: an agent knowing she is guided by that very theory should, under ordinary epistemic conditions, endorse her guidance.  CDT in predictor cases lacks that property; your awareness that CDT will change its advice if your credence shifts gives you reason to manipulate that credence or to move to a rival theory.  Indeed agents who anticipate such instability can gain by pre-committing to Evidential Decision Theory, Functional Decision Theory, or another policy-evaluating rule.  The dominance of such rival rules in predictor settings is itself evidence that CDT is not reflectively tenable.\n\n5.3 Loss of Normative Freedom  \n\nAn under-appreciated consequence of oscillation is that it hands Death\u2014or any sufficiently shrewd predictor\u2014normative control over you.  Because your utilities swing with p and p is responsive to exogenous cues (rumors about where other travelers are headed, a flapping awning that primes \u201cDamascus\u201d), Death can influence your ultimate choice without causal pathways, merely by predicting your preference swings.  That violates the spirit of causal independence more flagrantly than Newcomb\u2019s Predictor ever did.\n\n6. Policy-Level Evaluation as the Remedy  \n\nA valuable lesson emerges: the correct object of evaluation in predictor problems is not the single act performed at one moment but the decision policy that maps informative states (including the agent\u2019s own credences) to actions.  Functional Decision Theory (FDT) and policy-based EDT both adopt this perspective: instead of asking \u201cWhat should I do, *given* that I currently believe with probability p that I will do it?\u201d they ask \u201cWhich algorithmic disposition should I implement?\u201d  On that frame the Death in Damascus agent compares two salient policies:\n\nPolicy D: deterministically go to Damascus;  \nPolicy A: deterministically go to Aleppo;  \nPolicy M: flip a fair coin.\n\nBecause Death predicts policies rather than last-minute vacillations, Policy M dominates.  Importantly, the comparison is unaffected by the agent\u2019s present credence about which policy she will adopt.  Hence no oscillation occurs.  The numbers depend only on exogenous features: Death\u2019s accuracy and bias, and the utilities of survival and death.\n\nBy moving from act-probability to policy-probability, the theory avoids assigning normative significance to unstable personal credences.  The remedy underscores that the dependence problem was not an accidental flaw but a sign that CDT\u2019s unit of evaluation is too fine-grained for predictor contexts.\n\n7. Objections and Replies  \n\n7.1 \u201cIsn\u2019t Mixed Policy Just CDT Plus Randomization?\u201d  \nRandomization indeed salvages CDT in Death in Damascus.  But CDT contains no general principle instructing agents when to randomize; the invocation of ratifiability or policy choice supplies that missing piece.  A theory that must be fixed piecemeal is inferior to one that delivers the right advice by its internal logic.\n\n7.2 \u201cReal Agents Can Quasi-Commit; So What?\u201d  \nYes, travelers can resolve to go to Damascus and avoid entertaining doubts.  But the normative question remains: is that resolve *rational* according to CDT?  A theory that rescues itself only by silencing deliberation is, at best, incomplete.\n\n7.3 \u201cDependence Only Appears in Predictor Cases\u2014A Small Corner of Choice Space.\u201d  \nPredictor structures pervade real life: contract negotiations, multiplayer games, political brinkmanship, advertising.  Any situation where others form expectations about you before you act embeds the same feedback loop between credence and outcome.  A decision rule that fails in such ubiquitous contexts cannot claim general normativity.\n\n8. Conclusion  \n\nThe dependence of CDT\u2019s advice on the agent\u2019s shifting act-probabilities in Death-in-Damascus-style cases is not a harmless oddity.  It robs CDT of action-guidance, violates dynamic consistency, and conflicts with the theory\u2019s own causalist ethos.  Standard patches\u2014forcing extreme self-credence, adding an external ratifiability constraint, or freezing probabilities at the outset\u2014either outsource the real decision to evidential considerations or leave CDT silent in key scenarios.  The right moral is structural: rational choice under prediction requires evaluating whole decision policies, not momentary acts whose expected utilities are wired to the agent\u2019s fluctuating self-beliefs.  That insight, codified in more recent policy-based and functional decision theories, shows that CDT\u2019s act-probability dependence is indeed a deep problem, and one that the theory\u2014as originally formulated\u2014cannot solve.", "output_tokens": 3532, "reasoning_tokens": 448}

Setting the Stage  \n\nCausal Decision Theory (CDT) has long been advertised as the \u201cgold-standard\u201d way for a bounded agent to turn credences and utilities into action.  In its canonical formulation (Lewis 1981; Gibbard & Harper 1978) an act A is evaluated by computing the expected utility of the causal hypothesis \u2018the agent does A.\u2019  Put formally:\n\nEU(A) = \u03a3w P(w\u2502do(A)) \u00b7 U(outcome of A in w),\n\nwhere P(\u00b7\u2502do(A)) is a counterfactual (or \u201ccausal\u201d) credence that holds fixed everything not causally downstream of the act.  What happens upstream\u2014the state of the distant past, the roll of dice that have already been cast, a predictor\u2019s earlier guess\u2014is treated as outside the agent\u2019s control.\n\nIn Death in Damascus\u2013style cases the upstream state crucial to the outcome is the city that Death predicted you would visit.  Because the predictor is very reliable, your credence that Death predicted \u2018Damascus\u2019 is highly correlated with your present credence that you will in fact go to Damascus.  That means your estimate of EU(Damascus) and EU(Aleppo) is sensitive to your current first-order probabilities P(Damascus) and P(Aleppo).  If during deliberation those credences shift\u2014even for purely introspective reasons\u2014your ranking of the acts can flip back and forth.  The question is whether this volatility constitutes a genuine defect in CDT.\n\nI shall argue that it does.  The dependence on moment-by-moment act probabilities makes CDT dynamically unstable, generates Dutch-book vulnerabilities, and clashes with the deeper rational ideal that decision guidance should be \u201creflection-stable.\u201d  After presenting the mechanics of the instability (sections 2-3), I consider two prominent repairs\u2014ratifiability and causal policy selection\u2014and explain why neither fully rescues orthodox CDT (sections 4-5).  I end by diagnosing the root cause (section 6): CDT\u2019s atomistic focus on single acts prevents it from responding appropriately to information embodied in the very correlations that give predictors their power.  A satisfactory decision rule must take the whole policy, not the immediate act, as the unit of evaluation.\n\n2. The Mechanics of the Case  \n\nHere is a stripped-down numeric version (after Arntzenius 2008).  You have two live options:\n\n  D: spend the night in Damascus  \n  A: spend the night in Aleppo  \n\nDeath predicts your choice yesterday.  If he guesses correctly, he will be waiting in that city and you die (utility 0).  If he guesses incorrectly, you survive (utility 10).  Death\u2019s tracker is 90 % reliable but slightly biased toward saying \u201cDamascus.\u201d  Concretely:\n\n  P(Death predicted D \u2502 you go D) = .9  \n  P(Death predicted D \u2502 you go A) = .1  \n\nNormalising on those two possibilities we get:\n\n  P(Death predicted D) = .9\u00b7P(D) + .1\u00b7P(A).\n\nIf you perform causal conditioning \u2018do(D)\u2019, you treat Death\u2019s earlier prediction as independent of your act.  So, in CDT language,\n\n  P_ca(Death predicted D \u2502 do(D)) = P(Death predicted D).  \n  P_ca(Death predicted D \u2502 do(A)) = P(Death predicted D).\n\nHence:\n\n  EU(D) = (1 \u2013 P(Death predicted D))\u00b710 + P(Death predicted D)\u00b70  \n         = 10\u00b7(1 \u2013 (.9P(D) + .1P(A))).        (1)\n\n  EU(A) = 10\u00b7(1 \u2013 (.9P(D) + .1P(A))).        (2)\n\nAt first blush those look equal, but remember: P(D) and P(A) are not exogenous constants.  They are the probabilities you yourself assign right now to choosing each act.  As you lean toward Damascus, P(D) increases, which raises the overall chance that Death predicted D; that in turn drags down EU(D) and, via the same term, raises EU(A).  A small incremental change in self-prediction therefore tilts the balance.\n\nPut numbers on it.  Suppose at the start of deliberation you are 60-40 in favour of Damascus (P(D)=.6).  Then Death-predicted-D has chance .9\u00b7.6 + .1\u00b7.4 = .58.  Plugging into (1-2):\n\n  EU(D\u2502P(D)=.6) = 10\u00b7(1 \u2013 .58) = 4.2  \n  EU(A\u2502P(D)=.6) = 4.2   (a tie).\n\nIf, prompted by symmetry, you push your credence in Damascus down to .5, Death-predicted-D becomes .9\u00b7.5 + .1\u00b7.5 = .5, so EU(A) = EU(D) = 5.  Now both acts strictly dominate the earlier expected utility, so you might keep searching for a still better blend.  Indeed, calculus shows the maximal value of (1) is reached when P(D)=1/2, yielding EU=5.  That is produced by any act mix that exactly equalises your credence.  But you are a single-shot agent: eventually you must pick D or A with probability 1.  Crossing that 50-50 knife-edge in either direction immediately drops the expected utility of the city you are now favouring, making the other city preferable.  The result is an oscillation: nudge toward Damascus \u2192 makes Aleppo look better \u2192 nudge toward Aleppo \u2192 makes Damascus look better \u2192 \u2026\n\nThe phenomenon generalises.  Whenever (i) the payoff difference between the states depends on whether an upstream predictor aligns with your act, and (ii) your subjective probability that the predictor aligns is a continuous function of your self-view about what you\u2019ll do, then CDT\u2019s expected-utility ranking is a continuous function of that self-view.  Unless the payoff function happens to be flat, there will be thresholds at which the ranking flips.  Deliberation\u2014as a process of refining credences\u2014can then send you ping-ponging across those thresholds.\n\n3. Why Volatility Is a Problem  \n\nA. Dynamic Inconsistency  \n\nThe first worry is pragmatic.  Decision deliberation is meant to guide action; yet CDT supplies guidance that is \u201cpath-dependent.\u201d  At t1 you lean Damascus and CDT declares Aleppo best, so you resolve to go Aleppo.  Resolution updates P(A) to 1, which (because Death is likelier to have predicted A when you go A) reverses the ranking, prompting a new resolution.  The loop can persist indefinitely.\n\nSophisticated agents avoid cycles by insisting on dynamic consistency: once an act is judged rational at a given node of deliberation, later cognitive updates that are themselves completely foreseeable should not undermine that judgment unless new empirical information arrives.  CDT violates that norm here, for nothing external changes\u2014only the agent\u2019s second-order belief about her forthcoming behaviour.\n\nB. Dutch Book Vulnerability  \n\nInstability exposes an agent to a diachronic Dutch book.  A bookmaker who can observe your real-time credences can offer a bet favouring Aleppo when you are tipped Damascus and another bet favouring Damascus when you are tipped Aleppo.  Because each bet is accepted when it looks favourable by your own lights, you enter both sides of a parlay that guarantees a sure loss (see Ahmed 2014, ch. 4).  A decision rule that makes an agent exploitable purely through predictable fluctuations in self-confidence is normatively suspect.\n\nC. The Reflection Principle  \n\nFrom a more philosophical angle, the Reflection Principle (van Fraassen 1984) urges an ideally rational agent to view her future credences as additional data: if you expect that in five minutes you will believe Q with probability r, and you have no reason to think you\u2019ll become irrational or be epistemically corrupted, you should already assign Q probability r.  CDT\u2019s recommendation in Death in Damascus depends precisely on whether you anticipate believing P(D)=x or P(D)=y after the next twist in deliberation.  Resisting Reflection is not impossible, but it incurs a heavy theoretical burden.\n\nD. The Sense of Lost Agency  \n\nFinally, agents often report a phenomenological sense that CDT\u2019s advice in predictor cases is self-undermining: \u201cIf I could just commit to Damascus (or Aleppo) without letting that fact leak through my credences, I would be fine\u2014but CDT won\u2019t let me.\u201d  That is not decisive by itself, yet it indicates a mismatch between the heuristic role decision rules are supposed to play in actual cognition and the way CDT is forced to treat self-locating uncertainty.\n\n4. First Repair Attempt: Ratifiability  \n\nJeffrey (1983) proposed that a rational act must be \u201cratifiable\u201d: after you condition on the fact that you are going to perform it, you should still prefer it.  Formally, A is ratifiable iff EU( A \u2502 I_do_A ) \u2265 EU( B \u2502 I_do_A ) for every alternative B.  In Death in Damascus, neither pure Damascus nor pure Aleppo is ratifiable, because knowing you will go there raises the probability that Death predicted that city, destroying its advantage.  Mixed strategies *are* ratifiable\u2014specifically the 50-50 lottery is.  Thus a ratifiability-augmented CDT tells you to randomise with equal probability, which yields stable expected utility 5.\n\nDoes that solve the problem?  Two objections:\n\n  (i) Implementation.  Private randomisation devices rarely exist, and if the predictor is reliable, he will foresee any pseudo-chance generator you construct.  True 50-50 self-randomisation is therefore unavailable.\n\n  (ii) Mis-locating the value.  Even if you could secretly flip a coin, the ratifiability criterion searches among *acts* (here, lottery tickets) and selects the one whose *execution* would survive reflection.  Yet the intuitive reason to praise the coin flip is precisely that you were already disposed to obey its outcome.  If you would ignore the coin given an unfavourable result, ratifiability collapses.  The real work is being done by a higher-order policy: \u201cCommit to obey whatever a truly random device says.\u201d  Focusing on the single act misses that structure.\n\n5. Second Repair Attempt: Causal Policy Selection  \n\nMore recently, CDT\u2019s proponents have suggested shifting the unit of evaluation from single acts to whole *policies* (Joyce 2012; Spencer & Wells 2019).  The idea is to compute the causal expected utility of adopting a rule R mapping information states to acts, then choose the rule with maximal value.  In Death in Damascus, one salient rule is \u2018Always go to Aleppo,\u2019 another is \u2018Always go to Damascus,\u2019 and a third is \u2018Go where Death is less likely to predict, given my evidence.\u2019  Because the last rule produces the 50-50 mix, it again comes out top.\n\nThis manoeuvre avoids the earlier oscillation, because your second-order credence about which policy you will adopt is typically resolved *before* you ask the policy what to do in this particular instance.  Still, the fix is less a reform of CDT than an admission that single-act assessment is inadequate.  Moreover:\n\n  \u2022 The policy space is huge; evaluating every mapping from evidence to acts soon becomes intractable.  \n  \u2022 If policies are chosen by the same CDT machinery, the theory threatens an infinite regress: you need a meta-policy for choosing among policies.  \n  \u2022 Most importantly, the step from act to policy is *ad hoc* unless grounded in a principled consideration of up-stream correlations.  Why stop at policies?  Some argue (e.g., Yudkowsky 2010; Garrabrant & Demski 2018) that only \u201cupdateless\u201d choice over world-program pairs fully captures the relevant dependencies.\n\n6. The Deeper Diagnosis  \n\nThe root pathology is not the algebraic dependence on P(D) per se.  Rational choice should accommodate true empirical correlations between our behaviour and earlier events.  The deeper issue is that CDT, as standardly interpreted, treats those correlations as *evidentially inert*.  When you contemplate going to Damascus, you do acknowledge that your doing so would be new *evidence* about the predictor\u2019s accuracy (Bayesians cannot ignore that).  CDT, however, forbids you from letting that evidence influence your causal expectation, because the predictor\u2019s choice is upstream of the do-operator.  The result is a mismatch between your epistemic and your causal conditionals.  During deliberation you oscillate precisely because you are pulled by the evidential reading (which says \u201cgoing D is bad news about surviving\u201d) and pushed by the causal reading (which says \u201cyou cannot affect Death\u2019s prior choice\u201d).  Small changes in subjective self-location modulate the tension, creating the observed instability.\n\nOne may put the point by saying that CDT is \u201cact-locally causal but evidence-globally impotent.\u201d  A more adequate theory should treat correlations that are predictably triggered by the cognitive act of deciding as decision-relevant causal channels in their own right\u2014what philosophers of science call *inference to the best intervention*.  Functional Decision Theory (FDT) and some forms of Updateless Decision Theory attempt to do exactly that: they model decisions as the outputs of a stable algorithm whose code is recognizable by predictors.  The right counterfactual asks, \u201cWhat happens in worlds where this very algorithm outputs D?\u201d  Because the algorithm\u2019s output is, in predictor cases, part of the common cause of both your act and Death\u2019s location, a single evaluation yields a unique, reflection-stable recommendation (\u2018Go where the algorithm output maximises utility under that common-cause model\u2019\u2014here, Aleppo given the slight bias toward Damascus prediction).  Whether that renders CDT obsolete is still debated, but it makes vivid why the dependence on act probabilities is symptomatic of a deeper fissure.\n\n7. Conclusion  \n\nYes\u2014the dependence of CDT\u2019s recommendations on the agent\u2019s fluctuating credence in her own act is a problem, not a harmless mathematical quirk.  It undermines dynamic consistency, invites Dutch books, violates plausible reflection principles, and signals a failure to integrate information carried by predictive correlations.  Attempts to patch the theory via ratifiability or policy-level choice either shift the problem elsewhere or tacitly adopt a richer causal model than CDT itself sanctions.  A genuine cure requires a theory that allows the causal impact of one\u2019s decision *as information*\u2014a theory whose counterfactuals are sensitive to the functional role of deliberation.  Whether that cure is best delivered by FDT, UDT, or some yet-unnamed successor, the lesson of Death in Damascus is clear: ignoring how your present credences about your own acts infiltrate the world\u2019s upstream causes is not a viable long-term strategy for a decision theory.", "output_tokens": 3943, "reasoning_tokens": 768}

Introduction and Thesis  \nCausal Decision Theory (CDT) tells an agent to pick the act whose causal expected utility is greatest: EU(A)=\u2211S P(S)\u00b7U(A,S), where the probability for any state S is unconditional on A whenever S is not causally downstream of A. In ordinary problems this works smoothly because an agent\u2019s degree of belief about non-downstream states is fixed while she deliberates. In Death-in-Damascus cases, however, the crucial \u201cstate\u201d is which city Death will appear in, and Death\u2019s location depends on a prediction of the very act now under deliberation. As the agent\u2019s credence in going to Damascus versus Aleppo shifts, so do the unconditional probabilities that Death will wait in either city, which shifts the computed utilities, which in turn can shift the agent\u2019s inclinations. A feedback loop is created: the theory\u2019s recommendation tracks an endogenous magnitude\u2014the agent\u2019s present act-probabilities.  \n\nMy thesis is that this dependence is a serious problem for CDT. It undermines action-guidance (the theory can give conflicting advice at different moments of the same rational deliberation), violates a plausible \u201cratification\u201d constraint on rational choice (one should not wind up preferring to have chosen differently once one\u2019s choice is settled), and reveals that CDT\u2019s act-relative perspective misidentifies the proper locus of causal influence in predictor cases. Various repairs\u2014appeal to mixed-strategy equilibria, adding ratifiability as a secondary principle, or insisting that nothing is amiss\u2014either alter CDT\u2019s core commitments or leave it unable to endorse any determinate act. The deeper lesson is that a satisfactory decision theory must evaluate policies from a stance prior to the fixation of act-probabilities, not acts from within a moving deliberational target; CDT, as standardly formulated, cannot do this.\n\n2. How the Agent\u2019s Own Probabilities Enter the Calculation  \nSuppose travel and every outcome short of death has zero utility; surviving the day has utility 0, dying \u221210. Death\u2019s rule is: he predicts where you will go; with accuracy .9 he guesses right, otherwise wrong; and he has a mild prior bias for guessing Damascus (he flips a biased coin that lands Damascus 2/3 of the time and Aleppo 1/3 before factoring in his information about you). Let p be your current subjective probability of going to Damascus. Standard Bayesian modeling of an imperfect predictor yields:\n\nP(Death in Damascus) = .9\u00b7p + .1\u00b7(1\u2212p) + (bias terms)  \nP(Death in Aleppo)   = .9\u00b7(1\u2212p) + .1\u00b7p.\n\n(To keep numbers easy we can ignore the bias or fold it into the 2/3 versus 1/3 priors.) What matters is that both probabilities are affine functions of p. Therefore the causal expected utilities are:\n\nEU(Damascus) = (\u221210)\u00b7P(Death in Damascus)  \nEU(Aleppo)   = (\u221210)\u00b7P(Death in Aleppo).\n\nBecause the multiplier \u221210 is common, whichever act currently looks safer is whichever currently has the lower associated probability of Death\u2019s presence, and that inequality depends directly on p. Shift p and the recommendation can flip.\n\n3. The Instability Exposed  \nImagine you begin in a neutral mood: p = .5. Because of Death\u2019s bias toward predicting Damascus, P(Death in Damascus) > P(Death in Aleppo), so CDT tells you, \u201cAleppo is causally safer.\u201d But the moment you start to lean toward Aleppo your own probability p of choosing Damascus drops below .5. That changes P(Death in Aleppo): as the agent approaches certainty about Aleppo, the predictor does too, so Aleppo grows more dangerous and Damascus safer. CDT\u2019s directive therefore reverses; it now tells you to head for Damascus. But the same feedback operates again. Unless the functions intersect exactly at a fixed point (unlikely without ad hoc parameter choices), deliberation never settles. Each infinitesimal update to your act-probabilities flips the sign of the causal advantage.  \n\nThis is not mere psychological vacillation; it is vacillation mandated by the normative theory. At every moment you are acting exactly as CDT directs, yet you can foresee that obeying the directive will immediately make it irrational, and so on ad infinitum. The dependence on p robs the theory of action-guidance.\n\n4. Why Action-Guidance Matters  \nA decision theory is supposed to help situated agents decide. Its prescriptions are delivered in real time to deliberating minds whose credences about their own future acts evolve in light of those very prescriptions. If following the theory predictably leaves one without a stable recommendation, the theory cannot serve its practical function.  \n\nOne might retort that, in the limit, an ideally rational agent would reach the fixed point where EU(Damascus)=EU(Aleppo) and hence be indifferent, so CDT is not self-undermining after all. But two replies follow. First, for generic parameter values there is no fixed point inside the unit interval; the functions cross only if the predictor\u2019s bias exactly cancels his inaccuracy. Second, even where a fixed point exists, CDT tells the agent to be in that mixed state, not to perform a particular act. A real deliberator cannot simply choose to have credence .423 that she will go to Damascus; she must choose where to go. CDT therefore issues guidance only on the higher-order question, \u201cWhat mixture of dispositions should I instill in myself?\u201d\u2014a question the one-shot traveler cannot implement.\n\n5. Ratification to the Rescue?  \nJames Joyce and others have proposed adding a \u201cratification\u201d test: an act is rational only if, were the agent certain she would do it, it would still maximize causal expected utility. This blocks recommendations that depend on p, because conditionalizing on the chosen act sets p = 1 (or 0), and in Death-in-Damascus either act then fares equally badly; so both acts pass or fail together, and oscillation ceases.  \n\nRatification solves the instability at a cost. It supplements CDT with a new normative principle not derivable from the causal calculus itself. Once we grant that augmentation, CDT loses its supposed virtue of providing simple, complete guidance from causal probabilities alone. Furthermore, ratification often advises \u201cparadoxical\u201d policies like deliberately randomizing, or refraining from introspection to avoid changing one\u2019s own p, tactics that conflict with ordinary instrumental rationality. The patch therefore looks ad hoc: it glues stability onto CDT instead of showing that CDT never needed it.\n\n6. Mixed-Strategy Equilibria  \nA second repair says: in games with predictors the rational solution is a mixed strategy at which the opponent is indifferent; the fact that CDT points toward the mixed strategy is evidence of its adequacy, not its defect. For Death in Damascus, the Nash equilibrium is the probability p* that equalizes your causal risk in each city. A CDT-guided agent will keep adjusting until she is disposed to randomize with precisely p*, then take either city according to that lottery.  \n\nThis answer underestimates two problems. First, CDT does not recommend randomizing; it evaluates each pure act separately, using the current p as a parameter. The dynamics that lead toward the equilibrium lie outside the theory\u2019s official prescription and rely on the informal psychology of the deliberator. Second, even if we build randomization into the option set, a one-person decision problem is not a two-person game. You are not trying to outsmart an adversary whose beliefs are held fixed while you mix; the predictor\u2019s beliefs co-vary with yours. The mixed-strategy idea therefore imports game-theoretic machinery that sits uneasily beside CDT\u2019s act-relative causal evaluation.\n\n7. Is Dependence Really a Defect?  \nA stalwart causal decision theorist might defend the status quo: \u201cOf course my probabilities about Death\u2019s location should change as my probabilities about going to Damascus change; that\u2019s just honest Bayesianism. A correct decision theory must allow its inputs to be updated, even if that means real-time guidance is hard.\u201d The reply is that there is a difference between (a) updating on new evidence about the external world, and (b) updating on nothing more than one\u2019s shifting hunch about which act one will pick\u2014hunches caused by the very calculation underway. Rational reflection should not be hostage to such self-made \u2018evidence.\u2019 The dependence violates what Richard Jeffrey dubbed the Principle of Reflection: one should not expect future probabilities, reached by sound reasoning alone, to differ systematically from current ones. Yet CDT encourages the agent to treat her own tentative inclinations as evidence about an external threat, which is epistemically perverse.\n\n8. The Deeper Diagnosis: Wrong Locus of Causal Analysis  \nWhy does CDT stumble here? Because it evaluates acts in isolation from the policies or decision functions that generate them. Your choice of city is linked via the predictor to Death\u2019s choice; the causal significance is not act\u2192Death, but algorithm-that-produces-act\u2192Death. CDT, focused on the skinny arrow from act to non-downstream states, misses that broader dependency. As a result it has to treat your transient subjective probability of Damascus as an independent variable, when in fact that probability is just the behavioral shadow of your underlying decision procedure.  \n\nUpdateless Decision Theory (Yudkowsky), Functional Decision Theory (Spohn, Joyce\u2019s later work), and other \u201cpolicy-selection\u201d approaches remedy the problem by evaluating whole algorithms from the ex-ante stance prior to any self-locating update. From that vantage the predictor\u2019s behavior is downstream of \u201cwhatever algorithm I am about to run,\u201d not of the particular city chosen. Because the algorithm is causally upstream of both the city and Death\u2019s prediction, the theory gives stable advice: pick whichever algorithm yields the best joint outcome across correlated worlds. In Death in Damascus, no algorithm can save you; every city choice is followed by Death. But at least the theory does not send you oscillating\u2014it solemnly informs you that life expectancy is the same either way, so toss a coin if you must; nothing hangs on it.\n\n9. Objections and Replies  \nObjection 1: \u201cCDT\u2019s oscillation is purely theoretical. Real agents are psychologically limited; they will stop at the first preference and act. So no action-guidance is lost.\u201d  \nReply: A decision theory aimed only at agents with arbitrary stopping rules forfeits its claim to normative authority. It is supposed to guide ideally rational deliberation, not exploit cognitive fatigue.\n\nObjection 2: \u201cAdding ratifiability is no ad hoc patch; it is latent in CDT\u2019s spirit.\u201d  \nReply: Ratifiability changes CDT\u2019s evaluative target. Original CDT asks which act, given present unconditional probabilities, has the highest causal expected utility. Ratifiability says: ask that question under a hypothetical certainty of performing the act. That is a different function from the original one; supplying it shows that the old function was insufficient.\n\nObjection 3: \u201cPredictor cases are artificial. CDT works in real life.\u201d  \nReply: Thought experiments are designed to stress-test principles. The same feedback arises in economic contexts where markets predict policy moves, in psychological contexts with accurate self-prediction, and in strategic settings with learning algorithms. A theory that fails in stylized cases offers no guarantee it will succeed when life approximates the same structure.\n\n10. Consequences for the Axioms of CDT  \nThe dependence on p conflicts with two plausible structural norms for decision theory.  \n\na) Action-Guidance. A normatively adequate theory must give a stable recommendation for agents who deliberate by its lights. CDT does not.  \n\nb) Ratification. One should not settle on an act then wish, by the theory\u2019s own standards, that one had chosen differently. CDT\u2019s dependence on p violates this because once p finally hits 1 (when you step toward Damascus) EU(Damascus) instantly falls below EU(Aleppo), and you judge your chosen act sub-optimal.  \n\nAny decision principle that predictably condemns its adherents the moment they act is normatively self-defeating.\n\n11. Broader Implications: Newcomb, Medical Newcomb, and Counterfactual Parasitism  \nThe Death-in-Damascus pathology generalizes. In Newcomb\u2019s Problem, your credence that the opaque box is full depends on your credence that you will one-box, so CDT again yields deliberation-dependent utilities. In Smoking Lesion and Medical Newcomb variants, your credence about having the lesion shifts as you ponder whether to smoke. The same instability lurks whenever an evidential correlation runs through the agent\u2019s own decision rule. The result strengthens the case for theories that treat such correlations as causally relevant at the policy level rather than evidential noise at the act level.\n\n12. A Better Principle: Evaluate Policies Ex Ante  \nReplace act-relative causal evaluation with policy-relative evaluation from an ex-ante perspective that precedes self-locating updates. Compute EU not of the act given current p, but of adopting decision procedure \u03a0, integrating over the predictor\u2019s response to \u03a0. On that view your probability of Damascus is not an input; it is an output of \u03a0 and so does not vary independently inside the calculation. Stability is restored because the calculation no longer chases its own tail.\n\n13. Concluding Verdict  \nYes\u2014the dependence of CDT\u2019s recommendations on the agent\u2019s present act-probabilities is a profound problem. It strips the theory of action-guidance, violates the ratification requirement, and arises from CDT\u2019s mislocation of causal dependence in predictor problems. Attempts to rescue CDT either change the theory (ratification), smuggle in external dynamics (mixed strategies), or accept indeterminacy. A deeper fix evaluates policies ex ante, as updateless or functional decision theories do. Until CDT is revised along those lines, Death-in-Damascus shows that its foundational prescription\u2014maximize causal expected utility using unconditional probabilities\u2014cannot be the last word on rational choice.", "output_tokens": 4300, "reasoning_tokens": 1280}

Yet in \u201cDeath in Damascus\u201d-style stories a puzzling thing happens.  Which act CDT recommends\u2014flee to Aleppo or hole up in Damascus\u2014depends on your current, still-in-flux subjective probability that you will perform that very act.  When you start to lean toward Aleppo, CDT says \u201cactually, given that tendency, Damascus comes out better.\u201d  When you pull back toward Damascus, the same calculation flips and urges Aleppo.  The recommendation is fragile, buffeted about by the tiniest perturbations in credence that accompany ordinary deliberation.\n\nIs that fragility a problem for CDT?  I shall argue that it is, but not simply because it feels weird.  Two deeper defects are exposed.  \n\n1.  First, the dependence on act probabilities makes CDT dynamically unstable: a fully reflective agent can find no stable point at which her deliberation ends.  \n2.  Second, the phenomenon reveals that CDT is sensitive to purely epistemic facts about what one is about to do, even though it claims to ignore such facts by focusing on the agent\u2019s causal power.  Far from \u201cscreening off\u201d non-causal correlations, CDT smuggles them in through the back door of act probabilities.  \n\nOnce those objections are laid bare, we can see why several proposed repairs\u2014adopting ratification constraints, prohibiting self-locating updates during choice, or insisting on mixed strategies\u2014fail to remove the underlying pathology.  What ultimately emerges is the need either to replace CDT with a decision rule that evaluates *policies* rather than momentary acts (for example Functional Decision Theory or Updateless Decision Theory) or, more modestly, to recognise that CDT must be supplemented by an independent principle ensuring *deliberative stability*.  The \u201cDeath in Damascus\u201d case thus functions as a diagnostic probe: it shows that CDT\u2019s standard recipe is missing a crucial ingredient.\n\nI.  Setting up the puzzle\n\nSuppose you have two options, go to Aleppo (A) or go to Damascus (D).  You know the figure of Death has a crystal ball whose predictions are right 90 % of the time.  Death also has a slight bias: if he is unsure he is more likely to guess Damascus.  If Death finds you, you die (utility \u22121000).  If you escape, you live (utility +1000).  There is no other intrinsic value in either city.  \n\nLet p be your current unconditional subjective probability that you will go to Aleppo.  Since the options are exhaustive, probability of going to Damascus is 1 \u2212 p.  Because Death\u2019s prediction accuracy is 0.9 and his bias favours Damascus, we can describe the relevant non-causally downstream states like this:\n\nS1: Death predicted Aleppo.\nS2: Death predicted Damascus.\n\nGiven p, Bayesian conditioning says  \nP(S1) = 0.9 p + 0.1 (1 \u2212 p) = 0.1 + 0.8 p  \nP(S2) = 1 \u2212 P(S1) = 0.9 \u2212 0.8 p\n\nThe expected utilities, computed *causally* (i.e. we treat Death\u2019s prediction as not downstream of your act) come out as\n\nEU(A) = P(S1) \u00b7 (\u22121000) + P(S2) \u00b7 (+1000)  \nEU(D) = P(S2) \u00b7 (\u22121000) + P(S1) \u00b7 (+1000)\n\nSubtracting yields\n\nEU(A) \u2212 EU(D) = 2000 \u00b7 (P(S2) \u2212 P(S1))  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003  = 2000 \u00b7 ((0.9 \u2212 0.8 p) \u2212 (0.1 + 0.8 p))  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003  = 2000 \u00b7 (0.8 \u2212 1.6 p)\n\nSo CDT recommends Aleppo when p < 0.5 and Damascus when p > 0.5; it is indifferent when p = 0.5.  A rational deliberator who initially finds both cities equally salient (say p = 0.5) is pushed toward either extreme by the tiniest nudge.  If she momentarily imagines herself in Aleppo, her p dips below 0.5, CDT blares \u201cAleppo is safer!\u201d, and p slides further downward.  The very same reasoning, starting with a momentary tilt toward Damascus, yields a runaway slide the other direction.  \n\nWhat matters is that CDT\u2019s advice at time t depends on the agent\u2019s credence at t about what she will do, rather than on objective causal features of the world.  In a live deliberation those credences are in continual flux.  The result is an acausal feedback loop.\n\nII.  Dynamic instability as a normative flaw\n\nWhy is that feedback loop a *problem* rather than an amusing quirk?  Consider the minimal requirements on a decision procedure:\n\nA.  Convergence:  deliberation should (barring computational limits) settle on an act rather than oscillate indefinitely.  \nB.  Self-endorsement:  at the moment of acting, the agent should not believe that some alternative, had it been chosen, would have had higher expected utility *in the same epistemic state*.  \n\nCDT in \u201cDeath in Damascus\u201d can violate both.  There is no guarantee of convergence because any small update in p flips the ranking.  More crucially, whichever city the agent eventually chooses (perhaps by an arbitrary tie-breaker), she is guaranteed to believe that, *given that very belief state*, the other act would have scored higher if only she had planned to perform it.  That is a violation of self-endorsement\u2014sometimes called *instrumental instability*.\n\nOne might object that this is merely a psychological fact about deliberation, not a normative failure of CDT.  Normative theories aren\u2019t required to guarantee our messy Bayesian brains will cleanly converge.  They only dictate what counts as rational given fully settled credences.  Yet the instability here *cannot* be swept away by positing some hypothetical \u201call-things-considered\u201d credence distribution that magically stays fixed while we calculate utilities.  The *very act of calculation* provides new information: it reveals to us that we are leaning one way rather than another, and that information is relevant because Death is a predictor.  CDT, as classically formulated, provides no instructions about whether to treat that self-locating information as evidence.  In Newcomb cases, CDT insists that the content of the opaque box is not downstream of your act.  But here the predictor\u2019s location *is* correlated with what act you are coming to perform.  CDT happily uses that correlation (via P(S1) and P(S2)) even though nothing causal flows from your present credence to the long-ago prediction.  The alleged pedigree of CDT\u2014that it respects causal independence\u2014is, in this context, unmasked as an illusion.\n\nIII.  The epistemic back-door\n\nNotice how the dependence enters.  CDT tells you to compute P(S) unconditionally with respect to acts.  But conditioning on *acts* is not the same as conditioning on *credences about acts*.  Unfortunately the two collapse in Death-style problems because your credence that you will go to Aleppo is highly correlated with the truth of S1.  The predictor takes your own dispositions as evidence; you in turn take that correlation into account, and the vicious circle is complete.\n\nWhat CDT should have insisted is: only causes licensed by the underlying causal graph may be used when updating probabilities.  Your momentary credence that you are leaning Aleppo-ward is *a downstream effect* of the world in which the predictor guessed Aleppo.  So, strictly, you should omit that piece of evidence when calculating the unconditional P(S).  In other words, CDT\u2019s prescription secretly needs an epistemic qualifier: compute expectations in an epistemic state stripped of knowledge about how you are presently leaning.  But once that caveat is introduced, CDT ceases to be a simple mechanical rule.  It tells agents to ignore information that they in fact have, for reasons that cannot be reconstructed from the causal graph alone.  That is, again, a fatal flaw: the theory either issues an impossible demand (\u201cbefore choosing, you must not know which way you are disposed to choose\u201d) or self-contradictory advice (\u201cgiven what you in fact believe, you should act on numbers derived from a hypothetical state in which you believed something else\u201d).\n\nIV.  Inadequate repairs\n\n1.  Ratification (Jeffrey 1983).  Richard Jeffrey proposed that a rational act must be such that, were one to learn that one were performing it, one would still endorse it.  That condition blocks non-ratifiable options whose desirability depends on not knowing that one chooses them.  In Death in Damascus both Aleppo-conditional and Damascus-conditional prefer the other city, so neither act is ratifiable; a mixed \u201e50-50 coin flip\u201d is the lone ratifiable strategy.  Ratification therefore predicts indifference between pure acts and a slight preference for randomisation.\n\nBut two problems arise.  First, ratification merely punts the instability to a higher level: why suppose the randomisation device is not itself correlated with Death\u2019s prediction?  If a flicker of thought about \u201etails means Aleppo\u201d shifts your credence enough, the same oscillation re-appears.  Second, the ratification move is ad hoc.  It was introduced precisely to rescue CDT from such paradoxes; yet it sits uneasily with CDT\u2019s causal motivation.  What causal reason have we to reject an act simply because knowing about it would change our mind?  Ratification imports an evidential concern (how your knowledge of choosing A would itself be evidence) into a theory that officially renounces such concerns.\n\n2.  Commit to mixed strategies ex ante.  Some decision theorists say: \u201edeath predictors are less accurate when the agent uses genuine randomisation; therefore the uniquely rational response is 50-50.\u201d  That proposal does yield convergence.  However, CDT does not compel it.  Expected utility maximisation over *acts*\u2014not over probability distributions of acts\u2014identifies mixed strategies only indirectly, by way of tie-breaking.  If an agent begins with p = 0.51, CDT unambiguously recommends Damascus; there is no instruction to search for a mixed strategy unless indifference is reached.  Hence the instability remains.\n\n3.  Freeze act-probabilities during calculation.  You might declare a rule: \u201eFix your current p; compute EU\u2019s; then act accordingly; do not, while calculating, allow p to drift.\u201d  This dogma-level rule amounts to saying that deliberation must be *opaque to itself*.  That runs counter to the ideal of transparency in ideal rationality models, and it is at odds with CDT\u2019s guiding rationale that rational agents should use *all* and only causally relevant information they possess.  Imposing deliberative opacity looks, again, like a patch rather than a principled extension.\n\nV.  Toward policy selection\n\nThe deeper moral is that evaluating single-stage acts in isolation is too coarse-grained when predictors, simulations, or dependable correlations are in play.  What one really needs is to evaluate *algorithms* or *policies*\u2014functional descriptions that fix the mapping from epistemic states to actions.  Functional Decision Theory (FDT) and Updateless Decision Theory (UDT) both proceed in that spirit.  Ask: \u201eWhich input-output map, if I were committed to it, would have the highest expected utility given the objective correlations in the world?\u201d  In Death in Damascus, the policy \u201ealways go to Aleppo\u201d and the policy \u201ealways go to Damascus\u201d each screens off self-locating information, so their expected utilities can be stably computed; the better of the two (here, Aleppo) wins.  A policy-based approach thus regains both convergence and self-endorsement without invoking evidential considerations or forbidding introspection.\n\nOne might concede that policy selection works but insist it is an *add-on* rather than a replacement for CDT.  However, once policies are admitted, the original CDT prescription for single acts becomes inessential.  All work is done by the higher-level evaluation, which explicitly incorporates correlations that CDT mishandles.  The upshot is that CDT is either redundant or incorrect: redundant if bolted onto policy evaluation, incorrect if left alone.\n\nVI.  Objections and replies\n\nObjection 1:  \u201eThe instability arises only in contrived predictor stories.  Ordinary life contains no such entities, so CDT\u2019s practical adequacy is untouched.\u201d  \nReply:  Even in mundane settings our choices are predicted by other agents, market algorithms, or parts of our own brain we do not introspect.  Any reliable correlation between how one leans and outcomes can generate a milder version of the same instability.  If a negotiation opponent tends to anticipate your concessions, your deliberation may slide analogously.  The theoretical defect is therefore general.\n\nObjection 2:  \u201eWhat violates self-endorsement here is not CDT but Bayesianism: beliefs cannot be perfectly self-transparent.  A sophisticated agent maintains a \u201acredal partition\u2019 distinguishing object-level from deliberative facts.\u201d  \nReply:  Distinguishing first-order from higher-order belief is helpful, but CDT needs instructions about which level to use in its expectation calculation.  Without that guidance CDT is under-determined.  Adding ad hoc instructions about ignoring or discounting certain higher-order beliefs merely reiterates my point that CDT as standardly formulated is incomplete.\n\nObjection 3:  \u201eInstability is rational; real agents frequently *should* be torn.  There is no guarantee that rational deliberation converges.\u201d  \nReply:  Being torn is compatible with convergence failure, but normative theories traditionally require at least *conditional* prescriptions: \u201cGiven these credences, do A.\u201d  CDT gives mutually inconsistent prescriptions as credences evolve in a perfectly ordinary, Bayesian-admissible way.  That is incoherence, not healthy ambivalence.\n\nVII.  Distinguishing the causal, the evidential, and the deliberational\n\nThe above discussion suggests a three-way distinction that CDT conflates:\n\n1.  Causal independence:  variable X is not downstream of act A in the objective causal graph.  \n2.  Evidential independence:  learning that A will occur gives no information about X.  \n3.  Deliberational independence:  the ongoing process by which one decides whether to do A is uncorrelated with X.\n\nCDT officially cares only about (1); in practice it needs both (2) and (3) to hold or else the expected-utility calculation goes awry.  \u201eDeath in Damascus\u201d is engineered so that (1) holds but (2) and (3) fail.  The dependence on act probabilities smuggles (3) back in.  Recognising this tri-partite structure is itself illuminating: once we allow that rational choice must be sensitive to deliberational dependencies, we realise that causal independence is not the full story.  Policies, not isolated acts, are the proper locus of evaluation because a policy can be deliberationally independent even when its constituent acts are not.\n\nVIII.  Conclusion\n\nYes\u2014the dependence of CDT\u2019s recommendations on the agent\u2019s shifting act-probabilities is a genuine problem.  It reveals that CDT:\n\n(a) lacks a mechanism ensuring dynamic stability and self-endorsement;  \n(b) covertly relies on evidential correlations it professes to avoid;  \n(c) cannot, without ad hoc fixes, tell an agent how to bracket self-knowledge acquired during deliberation.\n\nThe best diagnosis is that CDT\u2019s focus on one-shot acts is too fine-grained when reliable predictors are involved.  A satisfactory decision theory must evaluate policies or algorithms, thereby respecting both causal structure and deliberative self-knowledge.  Until CDT is revised along those lines\u2014or replaced by a theory like Functional Decision Theory\u2014it remains vulnerable to \u201cDeath in Damascus\u201d and its many real-world cousins.", "output_tokens": 3915, "reasoning_tokens": 320}

Introduction and Thesis\n\nAt first glance, the Death in Damascus story looks like a curiosity about omniscient grim reapers. Under the microscope, however, it exposes an unheralded structural feature of Causal Decision Theory (CDT): the value it assigns an act is a function of the agent\u2019s own credence that she will perform that very act. Because those credences can and typically do shift during deliberation, CDT\u2019s advice can oscillate in real time. My thesis is that this \u201cself-reference\u201d is not merely odd but normatively disabling. An adequate decision theory must satisfy two guidance requirements:\n\nA. Deliberation invariance: once one has evaluated the options using the theory, further reflection should not predictably change what the theory itself recommends, on pain of paralyzing regress.\n\nB. Choice autonomy: the theory should not make the rational permissibility of an act hinge on stochastic facts about how likely I currently think I am to do it, for those facts are not among the worldly features for which a rational agent should be penalized or rewarded.\n\nBecause CDT violates both conditions in Death-style cases, its dependence on act probabilities is indeed a serious problem. I defend that verdict in five steps. First, I reconstruct CDT\u2019s mechanics and show exactly how the dependence arises (\u00a72). Second, I demonstrate how it engineers instability and time-inconsistency (\u00a73). Third, I rebut three prominent defences: (i) \u201cfixed-point\u201d solutions, (ii) the claim that the pathology is merely epistemic, and (iii) the suggestion that ratifiability repairs the theory (\u00a74). Fourth, I locate the deeper lesson: by tethering value to one\u2019s own intensional states, CDT mistakes deliberative evidence for causal information (\u00a75). Fifth, I sketch what a correct successor theory would look like (\u00a76). I conclude that the problem is substantive and forces a revision of CDT\u2019s core recipe.\n\n2. How CDT\u2019s Self-Referential Valuations Arise\n\nCDT tells us to pick the act with highest causal expected utility (CEU):\n\nCEU(A) = \u03a3s P(s |\u2205) \u00b7 U(outcome of A in s),\n\nwhere the sum ranges over states s that are not causally downstream of A; P is the agent\u2019s unconditional credence distribution prior to choosing.\n\nIn ordinary problems\u2014say, choosing chocolate or vanilla\u2014my prior credence that I will choose chocolate does not appear in CEU(Chocolate) because \u201cI choose chocolate\u201d is downstream of the act and hence excluded from the states s. Death in Damascus is special because the predictor\u2019s location of Death is determined by his prediction about where I shall be, and that prediction is formed before I act. Therefore, whether Death awaits in Damascus is not causally downstream of my eventual choice. It is fixed by the predictor\u2019s prior belief about that eventual choice. Consequently:\n\nCEU(Damascus) = P(Death in Damascus) \u00b7 (-\u221e) + P(Death in Aleppo) \u00b7 (0),\nCEU(Aleppo)   = P(Death in Aleppo) \u00b7 (-\u221e) + P(Death in Damascus) \u00b7 (0).\n\nSuppose I initially regard my probability of going to Damascus as p. If I know the predictor is 90 % reliable and has a built-in bias of 10 % toward guessing Damascus, standard Bayesian conditioning yields:\n\nP(Death in Damascus) = 0.9p + 0.1(1-p) = 0.1 + 0.8p,\nP(Death in Aleppo)   = 0.9(1-p) + 0.1p = 0.9 - 0.8p.\n\nPlugging these into the CEUs, one obtains:\n\nCEU(Damascus) \u221d \u2013(0.1 + 0.8p),\nCEU(Aleppo)   \u221d \u2013(0.9 \u2013 0.8p).\n\nThe ordering depends on p: if p < 0.5 CDT says \u201cDamascus,\u201d if p > 0.5 it says \u201cAleppo,\u201d and if p = 0.5 it is indifferent. In deliberation I typically have no settled prior about what I\u2019ll do; small evidential tremors shift p, which flips the recommendation, which in turn alters p, and so on. This is the dependence that fuels the instability.\n\n3. Instability, Time-Inconsistency, and Paralysis\n\nImagine an agent, Elena, who begins torn: p = 0.5. She flips a mental coin and leans 51 % Damascus. Given that p now exceeds 0.5, CDT says \u201cAleppo!\u201d Elena updates, so p = 0.49. CDT reverses: \u201cDamascus!\u201d Iterating produces an infinite sequence of switches with decreasing amplitudes that never settle at a decision.* Elena is rational by CDT\u2019s own lights at each micro-stage, yet overall she is paralysed.\n\nTwo deeper pathologies follow.\n\n3.1 Dynamic Dutch Books  \nA bookie who can bet quickly during deliberation can institute a sequence of fair bets that, at each moment, Elena regards as expectation-neutral, yet which jointly guarantee her a loss. The genealogy of the loss traces to CDT\u2019s non-invariant valuations: what was fair at t is unfavourable at t+1. This violates a minimal coherence norm.\n\n3.2 Preference Reversal  \nSuppose Elena somehow commits to Aleppo when her credence had inched above 0.5. After commitment she recognises\u2014indeed she predicts\u2014that once the ticket is bought, her credence she will go to Aleppo will hit 1, pushing P(Death in Aleppo) to 0.9 and making Aleppo far worse by her lights than Damascus would then have been. She knowingly locks herself into an option she expects to regret. CDT thereby counsels a plan that is time-inconsistent by its own standards.\n\nA decision rule that systematically generates such cycles and preference reversals cannot serve as a practical guide.\n\n4. Three Defences and Why They Fail\n\n4.1 The Fixed-Point Gambit  \nSkyrms (1990) suggests that rational deliberation must land on a fixed-point: a credence function P* and act A* such that A* maximises CEU relative to P* and P*(A*) = 1. Elena\u2019s unsteady coin flips violate the rationality constraint; she should instead search for a fixed-point and move there directly. In Death in Damascus the only fixed-points are (Damascus, p=0) and (Aleppo, p=1): act with certainty. But these points are unreachable unless the agent can deterministically force herself, and CDT offers no argument why rationality requires that. Worse, which fixed-point is selected turns on arbitrary tremors in initial p; CDT becomes hostage to epistemic accidents. A theory of rational choice should not tell agents to make luck-based leaps.\n\n4.2 \u201cIt\u2019s Merely Epistemic\u201d  \nAnother reply concedes instability but claims it is confined to belief, not to action: an agent may toggle credences yet still be free to choose either city. This is mistaken. As we saw, CEU slides linearly with p; each change in belief flips the ranking of acts. So the instability infects the normative verdict itself, not just the epistemic inputs.\n\n4.3 Ratifiability to the Rescue?  \nJeffrey and later Arntzenius propose adding a ratifiability constraint: an act is rational only if, after learning that one is going to do it, one would still endorse it. Formally, choose A only if CEU(A | \u201cI do A\u201d) \u2265 CEU(B | \u201cI do A\u201d) for all B. In Death in Damascus, however, no act is ratifiable. Conditional on \u201cI go to Damascus,\u201d the predictor\u2019s accuracy fractions make death there highly probable, rendering Damascus irrational. Conditional on \u201cI go to Aleppo,\u201d mutatis mutandis. The ratifiability fix thus delivers an \u201cempty set\u201d of rational options, which does not guide choice. Even if modified to pick the least unratifiable act, the proposal again lets stochastic facts about my current credence dictate the choice. The ailment remains.\n\n5. The Deeper Diagnosis: Mistaking Deliberative Evidence for Causal Relevance\n\nWhy does CDT stumble here but not in garden-variety cases? Because it misplaces the evidential role of one\u2019s own decision process. That I am currently 0.6 confident I will go to Damascus is indeed excellent evidence about Death\u2019s location, but it is not a causal feature of the world that rational choice should aim to affect. A normative theory should treat self-locating facts about deliberation the way it treats mood fluctuations or background music: as irrelevant to the objective ranking of plans.\n\nCDT\u2019s conditional exclusion of downstream states was supposed to enforce that irrelevance. Yet the Death case sneaks my credence back in because the predictor has used it as input. The root problem is that CDT bluntly divides the world into \u201ccausal descendants\u201d and \u201ceverything else\u201d irrespective of how the information about the latter is generated. When information is reflexively connected to my decision process, the partition collapses.\n\n6. Toward a Remedy: Deliberation-Proof Decision Theory\n\nA correct successor should satisfy:\n\n(i) Deliberation invariance: changes in purely deliberative credences must not by themselves flip rankings.\n\n(ii) Temporal coherence: acts chosen now remain best in ex ante and ex post perspectives.\n\nSeveral proposals advance in that direction.\n\n6.1 Evidential Decision Theory (EDT)  \nEDT evaluates acts by conditionalizing on the act itself: EU(A) = \u03a3s P(s | A)U(outcome). EDT decouples value from prior act probabilities; \u201cI do A\u201d is treated as certain. In Death in Damascus, EDT straightforwardly prefers Damascus because conditional on going to Damascus death is less likely (the predictor favours guessing it anyway). Critics worry about smoking lesion-type cases, but those involve genuine causal independence, unlike the reflexive link here.\n\n6.2 Functional Decision Theory / Updateless CDT  \nNewer approaches (Yudkowsky & Soares) advise agents to maximise expected utility from the perspective of the algorithm they implement, prior to learning the outcome of internal randomness. Because the algorithm\u2019s code is fixed, its probability of outputting A is either 1 (deterministic) or defined by exogenous randomizers; internal vacillation is irrelevant. The theory therefore avoids the underspecification to which CDT succumbs.\n\n6.3 Two-Level Theories  \nA minimal repair keeps CDT at the execution level but requires agents to pre-commit, before introspecting about their own likelihoods, to whichever mixed strategy globally maximises expected value. In Death in Damascus that is the 50/50 mix: it equalises Death\u2019s predictive edge and yields survival probability 0.5, strictly better than either pure act\u2019s 0.1 or 0.9 death probability. Such two-level views preserve causal reasoning about exogenous states while filtering out self-referential noise.\n\nWhether one endorses EDT, functionalism, or a two-level CDT, the moral is uniform: normatively relevant probabilities must be insulated from the very deliberation whose products they are meant to guide.\n\n7. Objections and Replies\n\nObjection 1: \u201cBut my act probability p is a genuine causal influence\u2014it shapes Death\u2019s prediction algorithmically.\u201d  \nReply: The locus of control matters. Through deliberation I can alter p, but only by altering my choice. If the theory already tells me which choice to make, the extra dependence on how confident I feel adds no new lever; it only sows instability.\n\nObjection 2: \u201cIf CDT is flawed here, so is any theory that uses prior beliefs. Vacillation is inevitable.\u201d  \nReply: The argument targets a very specific feedback loop: the evaluation functional itself contains p. EDT and functional theories depend on posterior beliefs conditional on the act, or on algorithmic facts independent of p, so their valuations are constant across deliberation.\n\nObjection 3: \u201cPragmatically, real agents settle; Elena\u2019s psychology would converge to one side.\u201d  \nReply: First, as the fixed-point analysis showed, where she settles is arbitrary, hence CDT violates symmetry. Second, rational norms apply counterfactually; if following a decision rule predictably yields cycles in idealised conditions, the rule is defective regardless of messy human limitations.\n\n8. Conclusion\n\nThe dependence of CDT\u2019s recommendations on the agent\u2019s shifting act probabilities is more than a quirk; it undermines CDT\u2019s claim to be a guide for rational choice. Because the dependence breeds deliberative instability, time-inconsistency, and susceptibility to Dutch books, CDT violates core criteria of guidance and autonomy. Attempts to rescue CDT by appeal to fixed-points, epistemic modesty, or ratifiability either fail or collapse into rival theories that insulate valuations from deliberative self-reference. The upshot is that decision theorists must either abandon the causal\u2013evidential divide in its current form or enrich CDT with a layer that neutralises self-generated evidence. Death in Damascus is therefore lethal not merely to wanderers but to orthodox CDT itself.", "output_tokens": 3109, "reasoning_tokens": 320}

The Set-up\n\nCausal Decision Theory (CDT), as originally formulated by Gibbard & Harper and by Lewis, tells an agent to evaluate each available act A by its expected utility\n\n      EU(A) = \u03a3s P(s | \u27e8causal parents of A\u27e9) \u00b7 U(A, s),\n\nwhere the probability is unconditional on A itself (or on any event causally downstream of A).  In ordinary cases\u2014buying a train ticket, lifting one\u2019s arm\u2014this delivers exactly the advice even commonsense deliberators would give themselves: perform the act whose causal consequences you antecedently expect to be best.\n\n\u201cDeath in Damascus\u201d (due to Bryson Brown, after a medieval fable) is not an ordinary case:\n\n\u2022  You must decide whether to spend the night in Damascus or in Aleppo.  \n\u2022  A supernatural entity \u201cDeath\u201d predicted earlier today which city you will choose; he is highly reliable (say 90 %).  \n\u2022  Death goes to the city he predicted; if you arrive there too, you die.  Otherwise you survive unscathed.  \n\u2022  You also know Death has a mild bias toward expecting people to stay in Damascus: when he is unsure, he guesses Damascus.\n\nBecause Death\u2019s prediction is (imperfectly) **correlated** with your act but not causally **influenced** by it\u2014his prediction is already made\u2014this is precisely the sort of case that pulls CDT and its rival, Evidential Decision Theory (EDT), apart.  And here a peculiar feature of standard CDT arises: the expected utility of each act depends on the agent\u2019s *current credence* that she will perform it.  As that credence changes during deliberation, CDT\u2019s recommendation flips back and forth.  The question is whether that dependence constitutes a *defect* in CDT or is merely a harmless reflection of the agent\u2019s changing information.\n\n2. Why EU(Damascus) and EU(Aleppo) Depend on q = P(Go-to-Damascus)\n\nLet q be your present subjective probability of going to Damascus, given everything you know *except* your final, not-yet-chosen act.  Let r be Death\u2019s reliability (0.9) and b (>\u00bd) measure his built-in tendency to guess Damascus when uncertain.  A simple model:\n\n      P(Death predicted \u2018Damascus\u2019)   =  r\u00b7q + (1-r)\u00b7b,\n      P(Death predicted \u2018Aleppo\u2019)     =  r\u00b7(1-q) + (1-r)\u00b7(1-b).\n\nIf you now *actually* go to Damascus, you die exactly when Death predicted \u2018Damascus\u2019.  Thus\n\n      EU(Damascus) = (\u20131) \u00b7 P(Death predicted \u2018Damascus\u2019) + 0 \u00b7 P(Death predicted \u2018Aleppo\u2019) \n                   = \u2013[r\u00b7q + (1-r)\u00b7b].\n\nAnalogously,\n\n      EU(Aleppo) = \u2013[r\u00b7(1-q) + (1-r)\u00b7(1-b)].\n\nWhat matters is the **difference**\n\n      \u0394(q) = EU(Aleppo) \u2013 EU(Damascus)\n           = \u2013r(1-q) \u2013 (1-r)(1-b)  \u2013 [ \u2013r\u00b7q \u2013 (1-r)b ]\n           = r\u00b7(2q \u2013 1) + (1-r)(2b \u2013 1).\n\nSuppose r = 0.9 and b = 0.6.  Then\n\n      \u0394(q) = 0.9(2q \u2013 1) + 0.1(0.2) = 1.8q \u2013 0.9 + 0.02 = 1.8q \u2013 0.88.\n\n\u2022  If q < 0.488\u2026, \u0394 < 0, so EU(Aleppo) < EU(Damascus): CDT recommends Damascus.  \n\u2022  If q > 0.488\u2026, EU(Aleppo) > EU(Damascus): CDT recommends Aleppo.\n\nThus the dividing point is roughly \u201cIf you are more than 49 % confident you\u2019ll end up in Damascus, go to Aleppo; otherwise, go to Damascus.\u201d  If, like most deliberators, you *begin* neutrally inclined (q \u2248 \u00bd), you will form a slight preference for Aleppo.  But the moment you resolve to book a ticket north, q plunges below 0.49 and the preference reverses: now Damascus looks safer.  Switch back, and the calculus flips again.  CDT appears to generate an *oscillating recommendation* with no stable answer.\n\n3. CDT\u2019s Oscillation as a Philosophical Problem\n\nTo see why many philosophers take this to be a genuine flaw in CDT, consider what we reasonably expect from a theory of rational choice.\n\n(1) Guidance.  A decision theory should deliver *actionable* advice.  A prescription that changes merely because I begin to act on it defeats the point.\n\n(2) Deliberative stability.  It ought not be self-undermining.  An agent who follows it should not be forced into endless vacillation or into launching a random generator just to settle the matter.\n\n(3) Insensitivity to epiphenomenal shifts.  As I lean mentally toward Aleppo, nothing in the causal structure of the world shifts\u2014Death has already departed.  A theory whose recommendation flips solely because of my *leaning* seems to mistake evidential for causal relevance.\n\nCDT\u2019s dependence on q clashes with all three desiderata.  For the Death case the only fixed points are the extremes q = 0 and q = 1 (certain you\u2019ll go to one city).  But if you could stably settle there, CDT would immediately tell you to do the opposite!  That is *deliberational incoherence*.\n\n4. Can a Causal Decision Theorist Dismiss the Problem?\n\nFour main lines of defence have been offered.\n\n4.1  \u201cTreat q As Epistemic, Not Psychological.\u201d\n\nJoyce and Arntzenius emphasise that q is supposed to be the agent\u2019s *objective* unconditional credence, not a fickle psychological state.  It is fixed by background frequencies, by the known reliability r and bias b, and by broad facts about agents like you.  Your moment-to-moment \u201cfeeling\u201d that you are leaning Aleppo-ward should not be inserted into the calculation.  Taken this way, q is unaffected by the micro-shifts of deliberation, so CDT gives a single verdict (here, probably Damascus because of Death\u2019s bias).\n\nObjection:  In many Newcomb-style or psychologised prediction cases the very *point* is that the agent knows she is an excellent predictor of herself.  If her introspective evidence that she is now 70 % disposed to choose Aleppo is not part of the probability calculus, CDT is ignoring information the agent in fact possesses.  Worse, CDT would outlaw *any* updating on one\u2019s own emerging intentions, banishing a perfectly ordinary form of self-knowledge.\n\n4.2  Ratifiability Constraints\n\nJeffrey and later Skyrms propose that a rational act must be *ratifiable*: it must maximise expected utility conditional on the agent\u2019s knowledge that she will choose it.  Mathematically, one seeks a fixed point q* where the act chosen at q* is the act assumed in computing q*.  In the above numbers, the only ratifiable act is staying in Damascus, because assuming you choose Damascus (q = 1) makes Damascus \u2265 Aleppo, while assuming Aleppo (q = 0) makes Damascus > Aleppo.  So CDT + ratifiability singles out Damascus and is *stable*.\n\nObjection:  The ratifiable act can be strictly dominated in ex ante value.  The agent effectively reasons: \u201cBecause I anticipate choosing Damascus, that elevates the probability that Death is there; therefore Damascus has the higher EU; so I choose Damascus.\u201d  Yet if by some miracle she ended up in Aleppo, she would survive with 90 % chance!  Many philosophers regard ratifiability as a patch that *sacrifices correctness for stability*.\n\n4.3  Mixed Strategies\n\nPerhaps the rational solution is to choose probabilistically: flip a coin weighted so as to *equalise* the expected utility of both pure acts, thereby making the predictor no better than chance.  In the toy model the optimal mix turns out to be exactly the unstable q \u2248 0.488.  But CDT was formulated for acts, not for *mixtures* of acts, and anyway the predictor is assumed to be better than random at reading even one\u2019s subtle biases.  If mixing is physically implemented (hesitations, micro-tremors) the predictor will detect those too.\n\n4.4  \u201cOne-Shot Policy Selection\u201d\n\nMiri\u2019s \u201cfunctional decision theory\u201d and Yudkowsky\u2019s \u201cupdateless CDT\u201d recommend: ignore the actual introspective probability; instead choose the *policy* that would have had highest expected utility *before* Death made his prediction.  Back then it was still open whether you\u2019d be predicted Damascus or Aleppo, so the policy \u201cgo where Death predicts I won\u2019t be\u201d had no way to break the correlation; symmetric policies tie.  The best full policy, given the bias b, is Damascus.  Yet this feels like resigning yourself to the predictor rather than *outsmarting* him.\n\n5. Why the Dependence Really Is a Defect\n\nI submit that the above defences leave CDT with a dilemma: either\n\n(a) keep the original CDT calculus, permitting q to vary with deliberation, and lose deliberative stability; or  \n(b) hold q fixed by decree (ratifiability, policy selection), at the cost of throwing away live information, endorsing dominated acts, and undermining the \u201ccausal\u201d rationale for ignoring downstream facts in the first place.\n\nThe root of the trouble is that CDT\u2019s prescription is *sensitive to correlations it recognises but treats as epistemic side-effects rather than as themselves decision-relevant*.  In Newcomb\u2019s Problem this makes CDT two-box even though one-boxing systematically yields more money.  In Death in Damascus the same feature causes the whiplash: the agent keeps looking for a point where her *causal* influence is exerted, but there is none to be had; everything informative about Death\u2019s location is evidential.  Because CDT insists on subtracting evidential impact from the calculation, the residual causal structure becomes *over-sensitive* to minuscule changes in the agent\u2019s credence about her own act.\n\nA principled decision theory should ground recommendations in determinants that are:\n\n\u2022  (i) stably knowable by the agent at the moment of choice, and  \n\u2022  (ii) not themselves outputs of the very deliberation they are supposed to guide.\n\nCDT fails test (ii) in prediction cases.  The probability q is *generated* by that deliberation.  Basing advice on it is like advising a person walking toward a cliff to *lean whichever way she is currently least leaning*.  No stable leaning exists; the advice destroys its own basis.\n\n6. The Broader Moral\n\nCDT was designed for environments where acts have clear-cut downstream consequences and correlations without causation can safely be ignored.  Once we populate the world with accurate predictors, simulators, or agents deploying the same deterministic algorithm as ourselves, that design breaks down.  In such worlds our acts are \u201csubjunctively entangled\u201d with states that are not downstream yet are nevertheless *dependent* on our decision output\u2014in the logical or mathematical sense that both are fixed by a common explanatory factor (our decision procedure).  CDT, tied to a purely *causal* dependence notion, cannot see this.\n\nHence the very feature queried\u2014the EU\u2019s dependence on act probabilities\u2014*is* a diagnostic symptom: it betrays that CDT lacks the conceptual resources to handle logical dependence.  Attempts to mask the symptom (ratifiability, policy precedents) either capitulate to dominated outcomes or smuggle in evidential ingredients under another name.  A cleaner fix would be to replace CDT with a theory that evaluates acts or policies in light of *all dependences an ideal predictor would exploit*, causal or otherwise.  Functional Decision Theory and the growing literature on \u201clogical decision theories\u201d are precisely such attempts.\n\n7. Conclusion\n\nYes, CDT\u2019s dependence on the agent\u2019s shifting act probabilities is a problem, not a superficial quirk.  It undermines the theory\u2019s ability to give stable guidance, forces ad hoc patches, and ultimately exposes a deeper conceptual gap: a blindness to non-causal forms of dependence that matter in a world of predictors.  If we take Death in Damascus-type scenarios as legitimate tests of rational choice, the reasonable verdict is that classical CDT, unmodified, is inadequate.", "output_tokens": 3733, "reasoning_tokens": 960}

In Death-in-Damascus\u2013type cases Causal Decision Theory\u2019s output turns on the very probabilities that the agent is in the act of determining.  That reflexivity makes the theory dynamically unstable: as one\u2019s credence that one will go to Damascus rises, the expected utility of going to Aleppo rises, which in turn lowers one\u2019s credence that one will go to Damascus, which in turn \u2026  The deliberative loop need not converge, and even when it does the recommended act can flip merely because the agent becomes more self-confident.  A decision rule that yields such path-dependent and potentially indeterminate advice is defective in two ways.  First, it violates a plausible procedural norm\u2014Deliberation Shouldn\u2019t Undermine Decision\u2014according to which a theory ought to deliver stable guidance across the course of ordinary reflection.  Second, it disconnects choice from the factors that actually matter causally to outcomes, thereby failing CDT\u2019s own guiding insight.  Hence the dependence on current act probabilities is not a harmless bookkeeping quirk; it reveals an internal inconsistency that motivates either a revision of CDT\u2019s machinery (e.g. through ratification\u2010style or policy-level reformulations) or its replacement by a different decision theory.\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n1.  Setting the stage: CDT and unconditional probabilities\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n\nAccording to standard CDT, an act A is to be evaluated by\nEU(A) =  \u03a3s  P(s) \u00b7 U(A, s)\nwhere the sum ranges over states s not causally downstream of A, P(s) is the agent\u2019s unconditional credence in s, and U(A, s) is the utility that would result were A performed in s.  In most everyday situations the probabilities P(s) are exogenous to the present choice; whether I order tea or coffee does not alter the chance that tomorrow will be rainy.  But in Death in Damascus (and in Newcomb, Mechanical Blackmail, Psychological Twin Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma, etc.) the state description \u201cDeath is in Damascus\u201d is correlated with my act because Death is a predictor.  Importantly, CDT instructs us to evaluate using *unconditional* probabilities: we do *not* condition on the act; that would collapse CDT into Evidential Decision Theory (EDT).  Instead we hold fixed whatever probabilities of Death\u2019s location we entered deliberation with.\n\nThis is where trouble starts.  Let\n\np := P(Go-to-Damascus).\nq := P(Death predicts Damascus | background evidence).\n\nBecause Death is a reliable but imperfect predictor, q is close to p but not identical.  Let the utilities be:\n\u2022 If I meet Death, utility = \u20131,000,000.\n\u2022 If I avoid Death, utility = +0.\n\nSuppose also that for aesthetic reasons I have a small preference \u03b5 > 0 for Damascus over Aleppo if Death is elsewhere.  Then the causal expected utility of Damascus is:\n\nEU(Damascus) =  (1 \u2013 q)(\u03b5)  +  q(\u20131,000,000),\n\nand likewise for Aleppo with p replacing q.  Observe: EU(Damascus) is a decreasing function of q, and q tracks p, so EU(Damascus) is indirectly a decreasing function of *p*, my present credence that I will go to Damascus.  The more confident I become that I will go to Damascus, the worse the causal value of doing so becomes.\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n2.  The path-dependence phenomenon\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n\nTake an initial situation in which p = 0.6.  Because Death tends to guess Damascus, q = 0.65.  Then EU(Damascus) \u2248 0.35\u03b5 \u2013 650,000, while EU(Aleppo) \u2248 0.65\u03b5 \u2013 350,000.  Aleppo dominates.  On hearing this, a reflective agent lowers p; after all, she is now resolved to go to Aleppo.  Suppose p \u2192 0.1.  That drags q down to, say, 0.15.  Now\n\nEU(Damascus) \u2248 0.85\u03b5 \u2013 150,000,\nEU(Aleppo) \u2248 0.15\u03b5 \u2013 850,000.\n\nDamascus dominates.  But once the agent resolves on Damascus, p creeps back up, and the cycle can repeat.  CDT\u2019s prescription therefore oscillates with the agent\u2019s evolving self-beliefs.  In the limit we may find a fixed point p* at which both acts tie, but:\n\na) Convergence is not guaranteed.  \nb) The limit, if it exists, can depend on arbitrary features of the deliberative path (how quickly p is updated, in what order considerations are entertained, etc.).  \nc) Even if one settles on, say, p* = 0.5, it is hard to interpret \u201cact-probability equilibrium\u201d as a recommendation the agent can compliantly implement.  Nothing prevents a last-minute surge of confidence that pushes her off the knife edge again.\n\nThese facts show not merely that CDT can give shifting advice, but that its advice is *constitutively* entangled with a variable\u2014credence in one\u2019s own act\u2014that the theory supplies no principled way of setting.\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n3.  Why procedural instability matters\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n\nOne might respond: \u201cReal agents eventually plump for something; why care if CDT twitches along the way?\u201d  The answer is that a decision theory is supposed to *guide* deliberation.  A prescription that is itself hostage to how sure the agent already is about following it cannot play that guiding role.  Put differently, the theory violates the norm:\n\n(DSD) Deliberation Shouldn\u2019t Defeat: Merely engaging in rational reflection under the theory should not predictably cause the theory to withdraw or invert its recommendation.\n\nThe dependence on p ensures such self-subversion.  Compare: if a GPS updated its route in response to every mile you *consider* driving, you would never leave the driveway.\n\nDynamic instability also undermines learning.  Ordinarily an agent can gather new empirical data to refine P(s) without fearing that the very process of incorporating the data will alter which act maximises expected utility.  With act-probability dependence, by contrast, any fresh bit of introspection into one\u2019s likely choice is \u201cnew data\u201d that scrambles the ranking of acts.  The result is a form of preference reversibility reminiscent of money-pump scenarios.\n\nFinally, CDT\u2019s selling point is its focus on *causal* control.  But the causal features of the world\u2014where Death is\u2014do not in fact vary with my fleeting credence that I will go to Damascus.  When the theory says they do (because it uses unconditional probabilities that themselves shift with p), it mislocates the boundary between agent and environment that its own philosophy insists upon.\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n4.  Diagnosing the root of the problem\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n\nTwo ingredients generate the feedback loop:\n\ni) The instruction to use *unconditional* probabilities;  \nii) The fact that those unconditional probabilities are not independent of the act when the environment contains good predictors.\n\nItem (ii) is not an exotic thought-experiment quirk; in a world awash with behavioural data and machine-learning predictors, our acts are routinely forecast.  So blaming (ii) is unpromising.  That leaves (i).\n\nBut (i) is what differentiates CDT from EDT.  Once we allow conditioning on the act, the theory collapses into evidentialism and endorses one-box in Newcomb, which causalists wish to avoid.  We seem stuck: keep (i) and we face reflexive instability; drop (i) and we abandon causalism.\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n5.  Proposed repairs and why they struggle\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n\n5.1 Ratificationism.  Jeffrey and others propose that a rational act must \u201cratify itself\u201d: it must be such that, having chosen it, the agent would approve of having done so.  Formally, we look for an act A such that A maximises expected utility *under the new unconditional probabilities* one would have after firmly intending A.  Ratification replaces the unstable fixed-point in p with a more robust fixed-point in intentions.  Unfortunately, in Death in Damascus the ratification process tends to select *both* acts or *neither*.  If intending Damascus raises P(Death in Damascus), the act may fail to ratify; likewise for Aleppo.  Oscillation is curbed only at the cost of indeterminacy.\n\n5.2 Policy selection.  Joyce and others suggest evaluating *entire policies*\u2014mappings from observations to actions\u2014by their causal expected utility.  Because the policy is chosen at the outset, the probability of its being implemented is 1, removing dependence on fragile interim credences.  In the Damascus story, a simple constant policy \u201calways go to Aleppo\u201d beats \u201calways go to Damascus\u201d, and the agent sticks to it.  This mitigates instability but at a price.  CDT was attractive partly because it respects the intuition that rational guidance should be available to agents who cannot pre-commit to policies (they may lack time or self-binding mechanisms).  Moreover, even policy CDT inherits a milder reflexivity: the value of a policy depends on the agent\u2019s credence in adopting that very policy, rekindling the original problem at a higher level unless the theory imposes an external equilibrium-selection rule.\n\n5.3 Stable causation approaches.  Spencer & Wells-Jensen (2020) propose that in predictor cases we should omit from the dependency graph edges that run from act to predictor\u2019s belief *through the channel of prediction*, because the latter is not under the agent\u2019s causal control *at the moment of choice*.  On that view, Death\u2019s location is screened off from my act by earlier common causes; hence P(Death in Damascus) is exogenous after all, breaking the feedback.  Critics reply that this manoeuvre undercuts CDT\u2019s canonical verdict in Newcomb: if Omega\u2019s prediction is similarly not causally downstream, CDT should one-box, clashing with its traditional stance.\n\nNone of these repairs enjoys wide acceptance, suggesting that the dependence on act probabilities signals a deeper tension inside CDT.\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n6.  Objections and replies\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n\nObjection 1: \u201cAny decision theory that cares about expected utility must consult act probabilities; CDT is not special.\u201d  \nReply:  The charge is half-true: probabilities enter through the expectation operator.  What is distinctive to CDT is that the *same* expectation guides both the evaluation and, reflexively, the determination of those probabilities.  In contrast, EDT uses conditionalisation to sever the loop: an agent can regard P(Death in Damascus | Go-to-Damascus) as fixed while deciding whether to go.  Thus the instability is markedly more acute for CDT.\n\nObjection 2: \u201cReal agents can anchor p at an arbitrary value (e.g. 0.5) and decide from there.\u201d  \nReply:  Arbitrary anchors are normatively unmotivated.  They amount to saying, \u201cChoose according to CDT but first pick a number out of a hat that may well determine the outcome.\u201d  A decision theory that needs a supplement of that kind is incomplete.\n\nObjection 3: \u201cThe oscillation illustrates merely that rational agents face *indeterminate* choice; nothing irrational about that.\u201d  \nReply:  Indeterminacy is tolerable only if the theory tells us what actions are \u201cpermissible\u201d within it.  CDT pretends to be maximizing\u2014*the* act with greatest expected utility\u2014so handing us a non-singleton choice set is effectively an admission of failure to rank acts.  Furthermore, in Damascus both options cannot be jointly permissible; one leads, in expectation, to hundreds of thousands more deaths.\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n7.

A viable causal decision rule must insulate causal expectations from self-referential probability shifts\u2014or else supply a principled equilibrium concept.  This is partly what motivates Functional Decision Theory (FDT) and derivatives: by evaluating the consequences of *the algorithm\u2019s output* rather than the physical act, FDT achieves stable fixed-points in predictor scenarios.\n\nLesson B.  The Death-in-Damascus instability reveals that \u201cexpected utility maximization\u201d is a two-place relation: it relates actions to probability measures.  A decision theory that leaves the measure unconstrained in predictor-enriched environments underspecifies its own choice function.\n\nLesson C.  Any defence of CDT must, at the least, augment it with a deliberation protocol\u2014a rule for how act-probability credences should evolve in light of the theory\u2019s advice.  Without that, CDT is a set of local gradients without an integral: no path-independent notion of best act.\n\nLesson D.  The thought-experiment undermines a rhetorical advantage CDT often claims against EDT, namely that only EDT is \u201cirresponsibly introspective\u201d.  In fact, CDT\u2019s prescriptions are even more sensitive to the agent\u2019s self-expectations.\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n8.

It prevents CDT from giving determinate, stable guidance when the world contains reliable predictors correlated with our choices.  That instability violates procedural norms of rational deliberation and compromises CDT\u2019s causal explanatory ambitions.  Attempts to patch the theory either abandon core causalism, re-import evidential reasoning under another label, or rely on ad hoc equilibrium selection rules.  The upshot is that the Death-in-Damascus case, far from being a nuisance anomaly, exposes an internal tension that any adequate successor to CDT must resolve.\n\n(Approx. 1,995 words)", "output_tokens": 3124, "reasoning_tokens": 192}

Introduction and Thesis\n\nImagine an agent\u2014call her Leonora\u2014who gives up a long-planned holiday because a stranger\u2019s urgent medical expenses exhaust her disposable income. Leonora feels no special sympathy for the stranger and knows nothing of his personal story. What moves her is simply the recognition that, all things considered, the morally right thing to do is to divert the money. Many philosophers say that Leonora\u2019s action, though right, lacks full moral worth. Because she acts from a de dicto desire \u201cto do the morally right thing,\u201d rather than from a concrete concern for the stranger\u2019s welfare, they diagnose her as a moral fetishist, someone whose gaze is fixed on an abstract object\u2014Rightness\u2014as if it were a trinket. In their view, truly praiseworthy agents must be motivated by the very considerations that make an act right (the stranger\u2019s need, his suffering, etc.), not by morality in the abstract.\n\nI will argue, contra this widespread suspicion, that acting solely from the motive of duty can in principle suffice for moral worth. The key is to see that a de dicto desire to do the right thing, when it is the product of a suitably informed and competently exercised moral agency, already embodies appreciation for the concrete right-making features\u2014even when those features are not what directly move the agent. Praiseworthiness does not require that the right-making considerations act as first-order motives; it requires that the agent\u2019s deliberative structure exhibit (i) norm\u2010sensitive competence and (ii) a regard for morality that is itself properly grounded. When those conditions are met, the charge of fetishism loses its bite.\n\n2. Mapping the Dialectic: De Dicto vs. De Re Motivation\n\nWe should begin by sharpening a distinction that has sometimes been left blurry. Suppose an act is right because it will relieve a child\u2019s pain.\n\nDe re moral motive: The agent is moved by the child\u2019s pain (or by sympathy, or benevolence).\n\nDe dicto moral motive: The agent is moved by the fact that relieving the child\u2019s pain is morally required; she desires, in general, to do \u201cthe morally right thing,\u201d and that desire explains her action.\n\nCritics such as Stocker, Wolf, and Railton contend that agents who act from the de dicto motive display alienation. They fail to value what morality is \u201creally about\u201d\u2014human flourishing, relationships, etc.\u2014and so their psychology is morally deficient even if their actions align with duty.\n\nDefenders, especially in the Kantian tradition, respond that a de dicto motive expresses respect for persons as such and is the only motive that guarantees reliability across contexts. But even many contemporary Kantians hedge: they allow that, in the best case, the motive of duty will be accompanied by appropriate sympathies and attachments. The question before us, however, is whether the duty motive alone can ever suffice.\n\n3. An Initial Intuition in Favor of Sufficiency\n\nConsider three types of morally right acts:\n\nA. Cases where the right-making features are transparent and affectively potent (helping a crying child).\n\nB. Cases where they are transparent but leave one cold (helping a disliked colleague).\n\nC. Cases where they are opaque, complicated, or epistemically remote (paying fair taxes, refusing to engage in insider trading because \u201cit\u2019s wrong\u201d).\n\nOur intuitions about moral worth shift across these categories. B and especially C suggest that upright action often requires the abstract motive of duty, because the relevant concrete considerations either fail to engage sympathy or are not fully grasped. If agents in those contexts lacked a de dicto motive, moral performance would be fragile\u2014left hostage to happenstance sentiment or incomplete knowledge.\n\n4. The Structure of a Competent De Dicto Motive\n\nFor a de dicto desire to suffice, it must function within a larger competence that tracks moral reasons. That competence has two components.\n\n4.1. Epistemic Competence\n\nThe agent must have reliable methods for ascertaining what morality requires. Leonora consulted trustworthy moral principles; she was not merely guessing. If she happened to do the right act for the wrong reasons (e.g., because she believed a horoscope that \u201cmorality favors generosity today\u201d), she would lack moral worth. Thus praiseworthiness demands that the de dicto motive hook up to genuine right-makers via a reliable belief-forming process.\n\n4.2. Rational-Evaluative Competence\n\nThe agent treats the requirement that p as sufficient reason to \u03c6. That is, she has internalized the norm \u201cIf morality requires \u03c6-ing, then \u03c6.\u201d This reveals a second-order evaluative stance: she values conformity to moral reasons as such. Importantly, that stance is itself grounded. She respects the moral law not as a fetishized object but because she judges that persons have equal dignity, that suffering counts morally, that promises are binding, etc. Those are precisely the concrete considerations critics worry about, and they are present\u2014but at the justificatory, not the motivational, level.\n\n5. Why the Alienation Charge Misses the Mark\n\n5.1. Misunderstanding the Place of Appreciative Understanding\n\nCritics mistake the phenomenology of moral action for its evaluative standing. True, someone who helps a child while feeling nothing might seem aloof. But moral worth is not a matter of warm feelings; it is a matter of being guided by the right reasons. If Leonora acts because morality requires helping, and her recognition of that requirement is grounded in an appreciation (at some level) of the child\u2019s claims, then she is not alienated. Her concern travels through a de dicto filter but remains keyed to the child\u2019s need.\n\n5.2. The Respect Form of Valuing\n\nKant distinguished two modes of valuing persons: affective attachment (Liebe) and respect (Achtung). Respect is not a sentimental orientation; it is a principled acknowledgment of another\u2019s authority as a source of reasons. Acting from duty exemplifies respect. Critics who demand affect mistake one legitimate mode of moral valuing for the only one.\n\n6. The Charge of Moral Fetishism Reconsidered\n\nThe fetish analogy suggests an irrational fixation. But a de dicto motive need not be an inert, contentless preference for \u201crightness.\u201d It is better understood as a regulative commitment: \u201cI shall act only on reasons that survive moral scrutiny.\u201d That commitment is instrumentally valuable (it secures reliability) and intrinsically valuable (it expresses one\u2019s identity as a responsible agent). Nothing fetishistic in that.\n\nTo underscore the difference, compare:\n\nFetishist Freddy: \u201cI thrill at the thought of Rightness. I want my ledger of acts to glitter with a metaphysical shine.\u201d\n\nPrincipled Priya: \u201cI am committed to acting as morality demands, because I recognize others as bearers of claims on me.\u201d\n\nBoth utter \u201cI want to do what\u2019s right.\u201d Only Freddy\u2019s attitude is fetishistic; Priya\u2019s reveals respect.\n\n7. Two Illustrative Examples\n\n7.1. The Cataract Surgeon\n\nIn a crowded clinic, Dr. Sato restores sight via assembly-line cataract surgeries. She does not dwell on each patient\u2019s story; time pressures preclude it. What fuels her relentless precision is a professional vow: to do what morality and medicine jointly require. Surely her conduct is morally worthy\u2014indeed more reliable than if she required a surge of compassion for each patient.\n\n7.2. The Dispassionate Rescuer\n\nLee dives into icy water to save a drowning stranger. He feels no warmth; he is terrified and numb. Still, a lifetime commitment to do his duty propels him. Retrospectively we praise Lee, not despite the absence of emotional concern but because, in that fraught moment, the abstract motive successfully overrode fear.\n\nIn both cases, de dicto motivation secures right action under conditions where affect, sympathy, or situational salience might falter.\n\n8. Replying to Three Objections\n\n8.1. The \u201cUnderstanding\u201d Objection\n\nObjection: One cannot be credited for doing what\u2019s right unless one understands why it\u2019s right. De dicto agents lack that understanding; hence no credit.\n\nReply: Moral worth requires enough understanding to recognize the act as right on adequate grounds, not the kind of rich, affect-laden grasp critics presuppose. Dr. Sato understands that blindness is bad and restoring sight is required; she need not savor each patient\u2019s narrative.\n\n8.2. The \u201cColdness\u201d Objection\n\nObjection: Actions done from duty alone feel cold and are therefore less admirable.\n\nReply: (i) Evaluative standards are not identical with affective reactions, and (ii) our admiration often grows when someone acts rightly without affective help\u2014when they overcome indifference or fear. We especially praise those whose moral commitment is strenuous.\n\n8.3. The \u201cMisidentification\u201d Objection\n\nObjection: A de dicto motive might latch onto the wrong acts if the agent\u2019s moral theory is mistaken, undermining reliability.\n\nReply: True; but the requirement I stipulated\u2014epistemic competence\u2014screens off this worry. Where the agent\u2019s methods are defective, moral worth fails. That is as it should be. The sufficiency claim is conditional on competent moral agency, not blind legalism.\n\n9. A Positive Account of Praiseworthiness from Duty\n\nPulling the pieces together, dutiful action is praiseworthy when the following conditions obtain:\n\n1. Rightness Condition: The act is in fact morally right.\n\n2. Motivational Condition: The agent\u2019s primary motive is a de dicto desire to do what is right.\n\n3. Competence Condition: The agent has and exercises reliable capacities for identifying what is right\u2014 sensitivity to evidence, careful deliberation, openness to correction.\n\n4. Valuational Condition: The agent\u2019s de dicto desire is itself grounded in an appreciation, at the justificatory level, of the values that make right acts right (welfare, autonomy, etc.).\n\nUnder those conditions, the agent\u2019s psychology manifests the two hallmarks of moral worth:\n\na. Reason-Responsiveness: She acts because of the right reasons (Condition 3).\n\nb. Normative Identity: The act expresses her commitment to be governed by morality (Condition 4).\n\nThese hallmarks capture why we praise: they reveal a reliable, non-accidental responsiveness to what matters and an endorsement of morality\u2019s authority.\n\n10. Comparative Advantages over the De Re Requirement\n\n10.1. Robustness Across Contexts\n\nEmpirical evidence on situationism shows that sympathy is finely tuned to salience and proximity. A robust de dicto motive supplies continuity: it motivates paying distant taxes, condemning casual racism, and protecting abstract rights that stir little feeling.\n\n10.2. Moral Learning and Reform\n\nHistorically, moral progress (e.g., abolitionism) required agents to override entrenched sentiments. Those who relied on intuitions of sympathy often failed to grasp the injustice of pervasive practices. What mattered was a principled commitment to do what is right even when society\u2019s feelings went the other way.\n\n10.3. Impartiality\n\nDe re motives easily become partial: my sympathy attaches to those who look like me. A de dicto duty motive imposes impartial discipline.\n\n11. Synthesis with Virtue Ethics\n\nOne might worry that my view sidelines virtues. Not so. Virtues are stable dispositions to respond well to reasons. The duty motive, under the competence and valuational conditions, is itself a virtue: practical conscientiousness. It partners with compassion and friendship but can stand on its own as a source of moral worth.\n\n12. Limits of Sufficiency\n\nI do not claim that de dicto motivation is always best. Rich moral agency often involves multiple strands\u2014sympathy, special concern, aesthetic sensitivity. Nor do I deny that habitual reliance on duty alone can make personal relationships brittle. My claim is conditional: when concrete motives are absent, the duty motive can still ground full moral worth.\n\n13. Conclusion\n\nThe suspicion of moral fetishism rests on a conflation. It mistakes the surface phenomenology of acting from duty\u2014an affectively austere appearance\u2014for inner alienation from moral values. Yet a properly structured de dicto motive already contains de re appreciation at the justificatory level and, crucially, manifests respect for persons as autonomous sources of reasons. When coupled with epistemic and rational competence, it tracks right-making features reliably and impartially. In such cases, acting from duty alone is not second-best; it is morally admirable in its own right. Leonora, Dr. Sato, and Lee deserve our praise not despite but because their conscientious commitment steered them where sympathy or inclination might not. Their actions reveal the deep moral virtue of principled agency\u2014a virtue without which the fabric of our moral lives would fray.", "output_tokens": 3107, "reasoning_tokens": 448}

Introduction and Thesis  \n\nCan sheer dutifulness\u2014acting from the de dicto desire \u201cto do what is morally right\u201d\u2014suffice for moral worth? I shall argue that it can. More exactly:\n\nThesis: A de dicto motive of duty is sufficient for moral worth provided the agent\u2019s desire to do what is right is (i) informed by a minimally accurate grasp of what rightness consists in, (ii) sensitive to the full range of concrete right-making considerations, and (iii) stably integrated into the agent\u2019s practical agency. When these conditions obtain, acting \u201cjust because it is right\u201d is praiseworthy not in spite of, but precisely because of, its abstract character: it manifests a second-order commitment to being guided by the normative authority of moral reasons as such.  \n\nIn defending this thesis I proceed as follows. Section 2 distinguishes three kinds of motivation and specifies what I mean by \u201cacting solely from duty.\u201d Section 3 reconstructs the two main objections\u2014that a de dicto motive is (A) morally fetishistic (Smith) and (B) alienating or cold (Stocker, Wolf). Section 4 offers a positive account of why dutiful action can be worthy. Section 5 answers the fetishism and alienation charges. Section 6 clarifies the limits of the thesis: when sheer dutifulness fails. Section 7 closes by situating the view between Kantian and sentimentalist extremes.\n\n2. Clarifying the Terrain  \n\n2.1 De dicto, de re, and de se motivation  \n\u2022 De re: I want, of Anna, that her welfare be advanced.  \n\u2022 De se: I want, of myself, that I keep my promises.  \n\u2022 De dicto: I want, of whatever acts are morally right, that I do them.  \n\nThe critics target the third. They admit it may often accompany de re concern (e.g., love of Anna), but claim that when it is the sole occurrent motive it cannot ground genuine moral worth.\n\n2.2 \u201cSolely from duty\u201d  \n\u201cSolely\u201d is ambiguous. I stipulate: the agent\u2019s direct motivating desire is de dicto\u2014no de re concern is occurrent at the moment of action\u2014though she may harbor standing de re sentiments in the background. Among available motives, the de dicto one is causally sufficient.\n\n2.3 Moral worth  \nI use the term in the Kantian sense: an action has moral worth when it is praise-worthy in the specifically moral dimension\u2014i.e., it exemplifies responsiveness to moral reasons. This need not coincide with maximal praiseworthiness all-things-considered.\n\n3. The Objections Reconstructed  \n\nA. Fetishism (Michael Smith). To desire rightness as such is compared to desiring a stamp\u2019s being rare merely because it is rare: the agent fixates on a formal property and is blind to the substantive values (others\u2019 welfare, fairness, etc.) that make acts right.\n\nB. Alienation and Coldness (Michael Stocker, Susan Wolf). Morality aims at the flourishing of persons, love, fellowship. An agent who saves a friend \u201cbecause it is right,\u201d rather than out of friendship, seems estranged from the friend and displays a morally impoverished character.\n\nBoth objections share a core assumption: that a genuinely virtuous agent must respond to the concrete right-making considerations themselves, not to their abstract summary label.\n\n4. A Positive Account of Dutiful Worth  \n\n4.1 Second-order normative commitment  \nWhat the critics overlook is the distinctive value of a second-order commitment to be guided by whatever reasons are, in fact, decisive. The de dicto desire \u201cto do what is right\u201d is not a contentless fetish; it encodes the higher-order judgment: \u201cWhatever the balance of moral reasons requires, I shall do.\u201d Such a disposition has three virtues.\n\n(a) Reliability under moral uncertainty. De re motives\u2014sympathy for Anna, love of art, aversion to suffering\u2014are partial and can mislead. The second-order desire functions as a corrective compass when first-order sympathies conflict or are silent.\n\n(b) Corrigibility. Because the de dicto motive is anchored in the property of rightness, it builds in an openness to revising one\u2019s plans when new moral information arrives. It is explanatorily sensitive to the very features critics accuse it of ignoring.\n\n(c) Integrity and impartiality. It integrates the agent\u2019s practical identity around the authority of moral reasons, forestalling akrasia and biased selectivity.\n\n4.2 An epistemic analogy  \nConsider the epistemic virtue of loving truth. A scientist who cares \u201cabove all to believe whatever is true\u201d manifests a second-order concern structurally analogous to caring \u201cabove all to do what is right.\u201d We do not call her truth-fetishistic even if, in a given case, her proximate impetus to double-check an experiment is the abstract desire not to err rather than a meaningful personal attachment to those particular data points.\n\n4.3 The contentfulness of rightness  \nRightness is not an empty label; it supervenes on concrete reason-giving features\u2014welfare, fairness, autonomy, etc. A desire for rightness is therefore, via rational connections, a desire responsive to those features. If I want to drink water, I thereby want to drink H2O even if I do not occurrently represent it as H2O. Analogously, wanting \u201cwhatever is right\u201d is wanting acts with the property that (say) they advance welfare and respect autonomy\u2014even if I do not occurrently focus on each ground individually.\n\n5. Answering the Objections  \n\n5.1 Against fetishism  \nSmith\u2019s charge succeeds only if the agent treats rightness as a brute, inexplicable allure. But a duty-motivated agent typically sees rightness as authoritative because she endorses the normative reasons making the act right. Her psychological focus is second-order (\u201cbe guided by the decisive reasons\u201d), not fetishistic first-order (\u201crightness, whatever that is, fascinates me\u201d). The fetish case is possible, but not prototypical.\n\nExample. Disaster triage. A medic with limited time may not have the emotional bandwidth to feel individual sympathy for each victim. Acting \u201cbecause it is right to prioritize those likeliest to survive\u201d is hardly fetishistic\u2014it is a rational de dicto orientation that efficiently tracks the morally relevant factors (expected benefit, consent, etc.) without drowning in paralyzing sentiment.\n\n5.2 Against alienation  \nA friend saved \u201cbecause it is right\u201d may still feel genuinely valued. The right-making facts\u2014her welfare, the promise I made\u2014are the very facts constituting rightness in this context. My de dicto motive takes them up implicitly, even if I do not dwell on them verbally. Moreover, the coldness complaint conflates motivation at the moment of action with overall character. A person whose occurrent motive is duty can, over a lifespan, cultivate rich sympathetic bonds; in emergency contexts, duty simply becomes the motivational \u201cfail-safe.\u201d\n\nCompare: I may attend a tedious departmental meeting out of duty to my colleagues. In doing so I manifest respect for them, not alienation from them. The same structure scales to higher-stakes morality.\n\n5.3 Why not always replace duty with de re motives?  \nBecause practical life is messy. First-order sentiments are selective, fatigue-prone, and context-dependent. An agent who acts \u201cjust because it is right\u201d exhibits a valuable kind of reliability and impartiality\u2014especially where sentiment falters.\n\n6. When Dutifulness Fails: Boundary Conditions  \n\nThe thesis is not that any desire to do the right is praiseworthy. Three failure modes matter.\n\nF1. Normative incompetence. If one\u2019s conception of rightness is grossly mistaken (e.g., a zealot\u2019s racist code), the de dicto motive yields wrongful acts. Moral worth is absent.\n\nF2. Formalism devoid of uptake. Suppose the agent treats rightness as a linguistic placeholder without tracking its grounds. She would not revise her plans in light of new reasons. This is genuine fetishism and lacks worth.\n\nF3. Fragility. If the de dicto desire is situational\u2014evoked only when convenient\u2014it does not constitute a stable commitment and so confers at most minimal praise.\n\nThus my sufficiency claim is conditional: given reasonable moral competence, genuine uptake, and stability, sheer duty is enough.\n\n7. Relation to Kant and to Sentimentalism  \n\nKant famously held that only the motive of duty confers moral worth. I accept his sufficiency claim but not his necessity claim. Love, sympathy, and care can also ground worthy action if they reliably track the moral reasons. Where I part company with many sentimentalists is in denying that concrete affect is always needed. A complete moral psychology will be pluralistic: sometimes love motivates, sometimes duty takes the helm, and often both cooperate.\n\n8. Conclusion  \n\nActing \u201csolely from duty\u201d need not be fetishistic or alienating. When an agent\u2019s abstract commitment to rightness is (i) epistemically informed, (ii) reason-responsive, and (iii) stably integrated, her action manifests a higher-order virtue: fidelity to the authority of moral reasons as such. That fidelity is itself a morally admirable trait, underwriting the praiseworthiness of sheer dutifulness.  \n\nApproximately 1,960 words.", "output_tokens": 2603, "reasoning_tokens": 576}

Orientation and thesis\n\nSuppose Hannah helps a stranger only because she has formed the bare intention \u201cdo what morality requires.\u201d She is not moved by sympathy, delight at the stranger\u2019s flourishing, or horror at his prospective suffering. Philosophers from Hume to Susan Wolf have worried that such a \u201cduty-first\u201d agent displays \u201cmoral fetishism,\u201d valuing morality as an abstract object rather than the concrete persons and goods that make moral demands weighty. I will argue, however, that a de dicto desire to do what is morally right can by itself suffice for moral worth. What makes such action praiseworthy is the agent\u2019s successful exercise of a distinctive second-personal capacity: the capacity to treat the moral standpoint as supreme for the guidance of her will. When that capacity is competently exercised\u2014accurately, reliably and out of self-legislated commitment\u2014the agent manifests respect for persons (including herself) as free and equal rational beings. That manifestation, not the presence of any particular first-order sympathy, is what merits praise.\n\nThe argument unfolds in six steps:\n\n(1) Clarifying the disputed contrast: de dicto vs. de re motives.  \n(2) The charge of \u201cmoral fetishism\u201d and why it appears worrying.  \n(3) A Kantian reconstruction of moral worth: formal authority and autonomy.  \n(4) Three sufficiency conditions for morally worthy dutiful action: epistemic, volitional, and structural.  \n(5) Replies to four prominent objections: alienation, motivational impoverishment, insensitivity, and redundancy.  \n(6) Why the sufficiency thesis matters: reliability, moral progress, and the division of moral labor.\n\n2. De dicto vs. de re: carving the target correctly\n\nFollowing Mark Schroeder, let us call a desire de re when its content is a particular state of affairs (that Anna\u2019s headache stop); call it de dicto when its content is a proposition of the form \u201cthat whatever is morally right be done.\u201d The dispute is not about whether agents should believe that the concrete right-making reasons obtain\u2014that is obviously required\u2014but whether their motivating desire must itself take those reasons as its content.\n\nThe critics\u2019 \u201cfetish\u201d charge therefore targets not mere acceptance of moral reasons, but a motivational architecture in which the formal property of rightness, detached from any of its grounds, does the heavy lifting. My question is whether that architecture, by itself, can ground praiseworthiness.\n\n3. Diagnosing the fetish worry\n\nTwo strands lie behind the charge:\n\n(a) Phenomenological: A morally ideal agent, we are told, cares about children, beauty, justice, not the trophy of \u201crightness.\u201d Solely de dicto motivation seems cold. Hume\u2019s complaint that duty is \u201cthe last refuge\u201d of a depleted heart echoes here.\n\n(b) Explanatory: Rightness supervenes on substantive facts. If one acts only for the supervenient fact, one seems to ignore what actually explains why the act is warranted. Hence, one\u2019s action looks \u201coff-track\u201d: the correct conclusion is reached, yet by latching on to the wrong premise.\n\nThese worries are powerful but not decisive. Their force rests on controversial assumptions about (i) what respect for persons requires and (ii) how moral cognition sustains agency.\n\n4. A Kantian reprise: why form can matter more than matter\n\nKant\u2019s notorious claim in the Groundwork that only actions \u201cfrom duty\u201d possess \u201cauthentic moral worth\u201d is often caricatured as glorifying chilly zealots. Yet the text\u2019s core insight is formal: what is morally admirable is not the affective color of an inclination but the will\u2019s acknowledgement of the moral law\u2019s authority. The moral law is the law one gives oneself as a rational being; so action from duty expresses autonomy\u2014self-government under universally shareable principles. Respect for the law is not respect for an abstract fetish; it is respect for every rational agent as the co-author of that law.\n\nOn a contemporary rendering (Herman, Korsgaard, Markovits), the \u201cdesire to do what is right\u201d is thus a second-order disposition to treat first-order reasons springing from others\u2019 needs or claims as decisively normative. That disposition can do the normative work critics assign to sympathy or beneficence while adding something those motives lack: acknowledgment of the equal status of all claimants. I now formalize this thought.\n\n5. Three conditions under which de dicto motivation suffices\n\nS1. Epistemic competence: The agent must accurately identify what morality requires in the circumstances. (A merely lucky hit lacks worth.)\n\nS2. Volitional control: The agent must be stably disposed to treat that requirement as decisive, overcoming contrary inclinations where necessary.\n\nS3. Structural fit: The agent\u2019s de dicto desire must relate correctly to first-order reasons. It must treat the property \u201cbeing right\u201d not as a brute magnet but as a summary representation of the underlying grounds. That is, the agent stands ready, on reflection, to endorse those grounds and to adjust her judgment of rightness if they shift.\n\nIf these are met, acting solely from the desire to do what is right is sufficient for praiseworthiness. Let me illustrate.\n\nCase: Exhausted Dr. Lee\n\nAfter twenty hours in a disaster ward Lee feels no warmth; she is numb. A child is wheeled in. She acts, not from felt sympathy\u2014there is none left\u2014but because \u201cit is my duty as a physician to help.\u201d Lee passes S1\u2013S3: she correctly sees what morality (and her professional role) requires, she subordinates her exhaustion, and her abstract commitment tracks the deeper reason\u2014the child\u2019s welfare. Intuitively, we still praise Lee. The motive of duty saves moral life when sentiments flag.\n\n6. Four objections met\n\nObjection 1: Alienation\u2014Lee helps but does not care; the child is used as a mere prop for Lee\u2019s moral self-image.\n\nReply: Caring manifests in more than affect. To govern oneself by principles that secure others\u2019 interests is itself a mode of respect. Indeed, Lee\u2019s stance may be less ego-laden than someone who helps only when gripped by vivid sympathy.\n\nObjection 2: Motivational impoverishment\u2014De dicto desire lacks the richness required for fully human virtue.\n\nReply: Sufficiency is not exclusivity. I concede that the virtuous agent typically houses both de dicto and de re motives. My claim is only that when the former alone operates (perhaps due to emotional depletion), moral worth is not forfeited.\n\nObjection 3: Insensitivity\u2014Because \u201crightness\u201d is an abstract label, the agent may fail to respond to the nuances of concrete cases.\n\nReply: Structural fit (S3) blocks this. A competent de dicto agent treats rightness as inferentially dependent on particulars. Indeed, focusing on the formal requirement may enhance, rather than blunt, sensitivity: she must consider every factor relevant to the permissibility of her act, not just those that trigger certain emotions.\n\nObjection 4: Redundancy\u2014If the agent must already grasp the substantive reasons to tell what\u2019s right (S1), why not let those reasons motivate directly? The de dicto desire looks otiose.\n\nReply: Two points. (i) Psychological economy: in deliberation we often use higher-order summaries (\u201cdo the safe thing,\u201d \u201cdo what\u2019s kind\u201d) that enable action under time constraints. (ii) Normative hierarchy: recognizing the authority of morality as such gives the agent a reason-filter\u2014an algorithm for settling conflicts amongst competing first-order pulls. That filter is valuable in turbulent moral terrains.\n\n7. Division of moral labor and the virtue of principle\n\nThere is also a social argument for the sufficiency thesis. A community of agents moved by sympathy alone will act unevenly: sympathetic attention is unevenly distributed. De dicto motivation, because it is impartial, can correct this. Think of institutional roles\u2014judges, jurors, civil servants\u2014where personal tenderness toward one party could corrupt fairness. Praiseworthiness here attaches precisely to the restraint of feeling in deference to an abstract requirement.\n\n8. A note on vicious de dicto analogues\n\nAm I licensing fanatics who pursue \u201crightness\u201d as they misconceive it? No. Epistemic competence screens them out. Nor am I licensing servile conformity; volitional control demands that the agent wills the law for herself. A Nazi who \u201cjust follows orders\u201d acts de dicto in a sense, but not under the right description: she takes the order, not morality, as final. Moral worth requires that the de dicto desire track the moral law, not any purported surrogate.\n\n9. Why the debate matters\n\nIf we deny sufficiency, we risk devaluing a large share of ordinary moral life: the parent who musters fairness despite fatigue, the citizen who pays taxes without patriotic thrill, the introvert who gives to charity out of principle. Conversely, affirming sufficiency does not denigrate richer emotions; it simply secures a floor of praiseworthiness grounded in autonomy.\n\n10. Conclusion\n\nActing solely from a desire to do what is right can be morally worthy because such action manifests a distinctive respect: respect for the moral law as the common will of free and equal agents. That respect is expressed whenever an agent, competently and self-critically, allows the abstract requirement of morality to govern her conduct. Far from fetishistic, the motive of duty is a structural commitment that integrates all particular reasons under a unifying principle and thereby secures impartiality, reliability, and recognition of others\u2019 equal claims. Concrete sympathies make morality humane; the formal motive of duty makes it principled. When the former are absent or mislead, the latter can still speak for us\u2014and when it does, we are right to applaud.", "output_tokens": 2715, "reasoning_tokens": 576}

Introduction and Thesis\n\nThe worry about \u201cduty\u2010fetishism\u201d begins with an intuitive contrast. Imagine two bystanders who plunge into an icy river to save a drowning child. Alice acts because she is horrified by the child\u2019s peril; Bob acts because, after a quick internal calculation, he thinks, \u201cRescuing that child is the morally right thing to do.\u201d Many find Alice\u2019s motive more attractive. On one popular interpretation, Bob\u2019s abstract concern with \u201crightness\u201d reveals a chilling detachment from the concrete value at stake\u2014the child\u2019s life\u2014and therefore renders his act less than fully praiseworthy.  \n\nMy thesis is that this reaction is too quick. A de dicto desire \u201cto do what is morally right\u201d can ground moral worth. Indeed, in some circumstances it is the best, and occasionally the only, way to guarantee that an agent\u2019s action is reliably and intelligibly connected to moral reasons. When such a desire is properly integrated into the agent\u2019s deliberative life\u2014serving as a second-order policy to comply with whatever considerations turn out to be morally relevant\u2014it manifests three features that suffice for praise: (i) clear recognition of moral reasons as reasons, (ii) committed self\u2010governance in light of those reasons, and (iii) a stable disposition to act rightly across changes in affect, inclination, or local knowledge. Far from constituting fetishism, this structure embodies a form of respect for persons (including oneself) as rational agents.\n\nTo defend the thesis, I proceed as follows. Section 2 clarifies the de dicto / de re distinction. Section 3 catalogues the main objections: the fetishism charge (Stocker, Smith), the worry about moral alienation (Railton), and the \u201cmoral saint\u201d complaint (Wolf). Section 4 argues positively for the sufficiency of a de dicto motive, drawing on cases of epistemic opacity, affective depletion, and value conflict. Section 5 shows why the agent so motivated earns praise. Section 6 answers the three objections. Section 7 situates the view in a broader Kantian framework while marking real departures from Kant. Section 8 concludes by diagnosing our lingering preference for Alice-type motivation and suggesting how the two forms of moral concern can\u2014and should\u2014coexist.\n\n2. De dicto versus De re Moral Motivation\n\nThe terminology is borrowed from the philosophy of language. A de re desire is directed toward a particular property or state of affairs in the world: e.g. \u201cI want that child to flourish.\u201d A de dicto desire is formulated under a description: \u201cI want whatever is morally right to occur\u201d or \u201cI want to do my moral duty.\u201d\n\nImportant refinement: \u201cdoing what is morally right\u201d must be understood dispositionally, not as a fetish for a mysterious property \u2018Rightness\u2122\u2019. It is the commitment to act in accordance with whatever the correct moral principles on inspection demand\u2014even when the agent cannot at the time identify the specific concrete grounds (welfare, justice, fidelity, etc.). The desire is therefore second-order: it directs the agent to be guided by the moral point of view, whatever it turns out to recommend. Provided we keep this function\u2010alist reading in view, we can bracket the worry that \u201crightness\u201d is treated as an occult intrinsic good.\n\n3. Three Standard Objections\n\n3.1 The Fetishism Objection  \nOn Michael Smith\u2019s influential version, an ideally virtuous agent is motivated by the features of an act that explain its rightness, not by its being right. To be moved by rightness is to focus on the wrong property\u2014a kind of moral fetish akin to loving someone for her social security number.\n\n3.2 The Alienation Objection  \nPeter Railton and Bernard Williams emphasize the value of unmediated attachment. If motives always run through the abstract filter of \u201cduty,\u201d the agent becomes estranged from her particular projects and relationships, and hence from her own humanity.\n\n3.3 The Moral Saint Objection  \nSusan Wolf suggests that an agent guided exclusively by moral rightness risks crowding out the non-moral excellences and particular loves that render a life rich and admirable. Such a person may be praiseworthy in a thin sense yet repellent as a full human being.\n\nAll three objections depend on the assumption that a de dicto motive is motivationally exclusive and affect-insensitive. I will argue that this assumption is optional and in most real cases false.\n\n4. Why a De dicto Motive Can Suffice\n\n4.1 Epistemic Opacity  \nOften we do not know the concrete grounds of rightness. A doctor in triage cannot trace every life-saving order to its justificatory basis. What she can keep fixed is the policy: \u201cDo what duty (professional and moral) requires.\u201d The de dicto desire functions as an epistemic placeholder linking action to justification. Without it, her decision pattern would float free of moral reasons; she would be guessing. That she acts from duty makes the relation intelligible and non-accidental, exactly the feature most theories of moral worth prize.\n\n4.2 Affective Depletion  \nEmpathy, care, and fellow-feeling are finite psychological resources. Imagine another rescuer, Carla, who has just endured the fifth emergency of the day. She feels numb. Still, she tells herself, \u201cThe child\u2019s life is in danger, and it is my duty to help.\u201d Her abstract commitment sustains right action when the emotional energies that normally supply de re motivation are exhausted. Acting well under such strain is paradigmatically praiseworthy; duty is the scaffold that keeps the agent aligned with moral reasons precisely when more sentimental motives flag.\n\n4.3 Conflict and Temptation  \nSuppose Daniel promised his friend to attend her recital but is suddenly offered a lucrative contract elsewhere. His passion for music is weak; his desire for money strong. What rescues Daniel from defecting is the remembered principle \u201cPromises must be kept.\u201d A second-order de dicto aim to honor duty enables him to counteract a first-order desire. Again, the structure seems not pathological but exemplary.\n\n5. What Makes the Dutiful Action Praiseworthy?\n\nThe three examples reveal a common structure. Praiseworthiness requires not merely causal connection to the right-making features but an agentive connection that reflects (i) practical recognition, (ii) self-governance, and (iii) reliability.\n\n(i) Recognition: The agent explicitly takes moral considerations as reasons for her. A de dicto desire satisfies this: the agent wants her behavior to fall under whatever reasons are morally decisive. That is a sophisticated cognitive achievement, not a defect.\n\n(ii) Self\u2010governance: The action issues from the agent\u2019s settled practical identity\u2014a policy she claims as her own. This is autonomy in a recognizably Kantian key. The will that bends itself to the moral law is praiseworthy as the expression of rational self-legislation.\n\n(iii) Reliability: A desire for the right as such is content\u2010neutral across situations. Whereas sympathy may track sufferings selectively (the cute sufferer, the in-group member), a second-order policy is impartial and stable. Reliability is a mark of moral character; hence its presence is ground for praise.\n\n6. Replies to the Objections\n\n6.1 Answering Fetishism  \nSmith\u2019s fetish image gains force only if \u201crightness\u201d is conceived as a detachable non-relational property. But on the policy reading, the desire is precisely to track the relational property \u201cwhatever is supported by the ensemble of concrete moral reasons.\u201d In loving my partner, I may in the moment be unsure whether to tell a painful truth or protect her feelings. A standing commitment \u201cto do right by her\u201d is not fetishistic; it is rational humility in face of complexity.\n\nFurthermore, de re and de dicto motives need not compete. Often the abstract policy feeds and structures the cultivation of more concrete motives. Knowing that alleviating suffering is (often) morally required, I train my sympathies. Far from displacing affection, the de dicto stance can incubate it.\n\n6.2 Answering Alienation  \nRailton and Williams rightly prize immediacy, yet they overlook how a de dicto motive can integrate rather than eclipse first-order attachments. The model is hierarchical: second-order duty governs the orchestration of one\u2019s particular loves, setting limits when they conflict, otherwise leaving them intact. Consider the parent who recites to herself, \u201cI must do right by my child,\u201d before deciding to forgo an academic conference. Nothing in that self-reminder alienates her from parental attachment; it articulates it in the register of obligation, making explicit why the attachment has normative authority.\n\n6.3 Answering the Moral Saint Complaint  \nWolf\u2019s moral saint is a person who allows moral considerations to swamp every aspect of life. But de dicto motivation does not necessitate lexical priority of the moral over all other values. One can have a policy: \u201cAct within the moral constraints, then pursue non-moral projects wholeheartedly.\u201d Morality occupies a deontic veto position, not an all-consuming maximizer. Respecting moral side\u2010constraints leaves room\u2014indeed, creates the secure space\u2014for aesthetic and personal excellence.\n\n7. Kant Revisited (With Modifications)\n\nKant famously privileges acting \u201cfrom duty,\u201d which for him means acting from respect for the moral law. Critics note that Kant sometimes speaks as though only de dicto motivation carries moral worth. I have argued for sufficiency, not necessity: de re motives like beneficence can equally ground praise when they appropriately track right-making features and manifest self-governance. This broader ecumenism departs from an austere Kantian reading but retains his insight that autonomy and stability matter.\n\nMoreover, on my account the duty motive is empirically pluralistic about the correct moral theory. An Aristotelian may have a second-order policy to act in accordance with phron\u0113sis; a utilitarian, to maximize well-being. The structure, not the content, is what carries the justificatory weight. This ecumenical stance fits better with epistemic humility than the categorical-imperative-centric reading of Kant.\n\n8. Why We Prefer Alice\u2014and Why We Should Still Praise Bob\n\nOur partiality for Alice\u2019s affective motive is rooted in two psychological facts:\n\n(1) Epistemic window dressing: Her compassion offers a transparent causal story we can empathically rehearse (\u201cI, too, feel horror at the child\u2019s danger\u201d). Bob\u2019s deliberation is invisible; abstract respect seems bloodless. But absence of emotional display is not absence of moral concern.\n\n(2) Social signaling: Warmth is reassuring, while explicit appeals to duty sometimes connote judgmentalism. Yet these pragmatic connotations do not bear on moral worth.\n\nRecognizing that de dicto motivation can suffice should not lead us to denigrate de re motives. The healthiest moral psychology includes both: affection supplies energy and local acuity; the standing commitment to duty supplies guidance, discipline, and reach. Together they form what Rawls called \u201cthe two moral powers\u201d: the capacity for a conception of the good (grounded in attachments) and the capacity for a sense of justice (a de dicto policy). A mature moral agent harmonizes them.\n\n9. Conclusion\n\nActing solely from a desire to do what is morally right can indeed suffice for morally worthy conduct, provided the desire functions as a second-order commitment that secures recognition of and responsiveness to moral reasons across contexts. Such duty-based action warrants praise because it (i) embodies rational acknowledgment of moral authority, (ii) manifests autonomous self-governance, and (iii) provides a reliable, impartial disposition to act rightly even under epistemic, affective, or motivational strain. The standard objections\u2014fetishism, alienation, and saintliness\u2014lose their force once we distinguish pathological from policy-based duty motives and appreciate how the latter integrates rather than displaces concrete moral concerns. The upshot is not that abstract duty should monopolize our motivational economy, but that we need not apologize for it. Sometimes, when our sympathies misfire, when we cannot discern the specific ground of rightness, or when temptation looms, the quiet voice that says \u201cDo the right thing, whatever it is\u201d is precisely the voice of virtue.", "output_tokens": 3087, "reasoning_tokens": 512}

Introduction and Thesis  \n\nIs a bare \u201cdesire to do what is right\u201d enough to make an action morally worthy, or must a praiseworthy agent also be moved by the first-order considerations that make the act right\u2014for example, by compassion for the beneficiary? I shall argue for a qualified \u201cyes.\u201d Acting solely from a de dicto desire to do what is morally right can suffice for moral worth provided that (i) the agent\u2019s de dicto motive is integrated with an adequate understanding of why the act is right and (ii) the agent would manifest the appropriate first-order concerns were she not impeded by circumstances internal or external to her agency. What makes such action praiseworthy is not the presence of a particular concrete motive but the agent\u2019s competence to track and conform to moral reasons across contexts. In short, moral worth supervenes on reliable responsiveness to right-making features, and a de dicto desire can implement that responsiveness just as well as first-order motives can.\n\nThe argument proceeds as follows. Section 2 clarifies the relevant distinctions: moral rightness vs. moral worth; de dicto vs. de re moral motivation; alienation and \u201cmoral fetishism.\u201d Section 3 reconstructs the main objections to de dicto moral motivation. Section 4 shows why those objections overreach. Section 5 develops a competence theory of moral worth on which a de dicto desire can ground praiseworthiness. Section 6 responds to residual worries about coldness, over-intellectualism, and the value of the moral law. A brief conclusion summarizes the pay-offs.\n\n2. Conceptual Ground-Clearing  \n\n2.1 Moral rightness and moral worth  \n\nAn action can be morally right yet not creditable to the agent (e.g., the accidentally beneficent deed); conversely, one can act from excellent motives yet fail to do the right thing. \u201cMoral worth,\u201d as Kant first highlighted, is the property of an action that is not only right but redounds to the agent\u2019s moral credit. Contemporary discussions typically reserve that label for cases in which the agent acts because the right-making reasons move her in the right way.\n\n2.2 De re vs. de dicto moral motivation  \n\nA de re moral motive is a desire directed at the very features that make the action right: helping because the other is in need, telling the truth because honesty respects autonomy, and so forth. A de dicto motive, by contrast, is an attitude toward the proposition that the action is morally right: one\u2019s reason for acting is simply that this is what morality requires.\n\n2.3 Alienation and moral fetishism  \n\nMichael Smith and Jonathan Dancy, among others, charge that the purely de dicto agent exhibits \u201cmoral fetishism\u201d: she is fascinated by morality as a formal property and thereby alienated from the concrete value of people and projects. Susan Wolf, Bernard Williams, and Michael Stocker raise related worries about motivational \u201cschizophrenia\u201d: the moral calculus crowds out personal concern and renders the agent cold or inauthentic.\n\n3. The Standard Case Against De Dicto Sufficiency  \n\nThree lines of argument dominate.\n\nA. The Missing Value Argument  \n1. Praiseworthy action should manifest appreciation of the considerations that make it right.  \n2. A de dicto motive abstracts away from those considerations.  \n3. Therefore, a purely de dicto motive cannot ground moral worth.\n\nB. The Alienation Argument  \n1. Morality is about promoting or respecting substantive values (welfare, autonomy, etc.).  \n2. Valuing \u201cmorality\u201d instead is to mislocate value; one loves the map, not the territory.  \n3. Such mislocation is fetishistic and thus not praiseworthy.\n\nC. The Practical Rationality Argument  \n1. Rational agency requires sensitivity to the contents of reasons.  \n2. A de dicto motive is too thin to explain why a particular act is required.  \n3. Therefore, such an agent is irrational or at least imperfectly rational; moral worth demands better.\n\n4. Diagnosing the Overreach  \n\n4.1 Misreading the De Dicto Desire  \n\nCritics tacitly assume a de dicto motive comes apart from appreciation of right-making reasons. Yet an agent can treat the moral law as a reliable indicator of those very reasons. The de dicto desire need not be \u201cI want to do the right thing full stop\u201d in the absence of any grasp of what makes it right; it can be \u201cI want to do whatever the moral facts, constituted by people\u2019s needs and rights, require.\u201d If so, the agent\u2019s motivational psychology is a two-stage mechanism: the higher-order desire to comply with morality triggers first-order recognition of concrete reasons. Nothing in the mere form of the desire precludes that.\n\n4.2 Respect vs. Affection  \n\nKant distinguished acting from inclination and acting from respect. Respect is not cold indifference but a mode of valuing persons as ends. When I rescue a drowning stranger \u201cbecause it is right,\u201d I still engage the person\u2019s plight; I simply frame my motivation in normative rather than sentimental terms. The critic\u2019s inference from \u201cno affection\u201d to \u201cno concern\u201d equivocates between psychological warmth and moral regard.\n\n4.3 The Reliability Test  \n\nSuppose two agents each help the stranger: Clara because she cares, Dana because \u201cit\u2019s the right thing.\u201d Clara helps when she happens to care; Dana helps whether or not she feels inclined. If reliability in responding to need is morally important, Dana\u2019s motive may be superior. The fetishism argument overlooks the dimension of robustness across contexts.\n\n5. A Competence Account of Moral Worth  \n\n5.1 Competence Rather Than Content  \n\nI propose that moral worth attaches to an action when it issues from a competence to track right-making reasons. Competence has two sub-components: (i) epistemic: the agent reliably forms correct beliefs about what is right; (ii) volitional: she is reliably motivated to act accordingly.\n\n5.2 How a De Dicto Desire Can Realize the Competence  \n\nA higher-order de dicto desire functions as a self-binding strategy: it directs attention to moral reasons and commits the will in advance to follow them. For many human agents, concrete sympathy is selective, but the moral-law desire is global. Its practical upshot is a plan: \u201cIn any circumstance, do what morality requires.\u201d If the agent\u2019s moral cognition is adequate, the plan ensures competent responsiveness. Therefore, de dicto motivation passes the reliability test.\n\n5.3 Why the Competence Is Praiseworthy  \n\nThree values ground the praiseworthiness of competence.\n\n1. Non-accidentality: Worthwhile conduct should not be a fluke; competence internalizes the connection between reasons and action.  \n2. Respect: To act because it is right is to give the moral law authority over one\u2019s conduct; that expresses the equal status of all persons whose interests constitute the content of the law.  \n3. Integrity: A higher-order plan unifies agency over time, enabling self-governance in the face of conflicting inclinations.\n\n6. Replies to Residual Objections  \n\n6.1 Coldness and the Huckleberry Finn Case  \n\nMark Twain\u2019s Huck helps Jim escape despite believing it wrong; his compassion overrides his sense of duty. Does Huck show that affection is the true seat of moral worth? No. Huck\u2019s act is indeed admirable, but the admirability stems from his implicit responsiveness to the right-making reason (Jim\u2019s humanity). Compassion here compensates for defective moral cognition. In a cognitively sound agent, the duty motive would serve the same function. The case shows that affection can substitute for duty, not that duty is unnecessary or insufficient.\n\n6.2 The Wrongful Obedience Worry  \n\nDe dicto agents, it is said, are hostage to mistaken moral principles; Nazis who acted \u201cfrom duty\u201d hardly deserve praise. True, but the problem lies in epistemic incompetence, not in the de dicto structure. A sympathy-only agent misled about who deserves compassion can do equal harm. Competence demands both correct judgment and appropriate motivation.\n\n6.3 Fetishism Revisited  \n\nIsn\u2019t valuing morality for its own sake like collecting stamps\u2014the object of value seems arbitrary? Not if morality is constitutively tied to reasons of universal importance. Respect for morality is respect for the network of properties that make actions right. To fetishize is to value a property detached from its grounding; the competent de dicto agent values morality precisely because it is a reliable marker of what has value.\n\n6.4 Over-Intellectualism  \n\nFinally, is the competence theory too demanding? Children and non-reflective adults do praiseworthy deeds without articulating moral laws. Note that a desire can be tacit; the competence can be sub-personal or habitual. What matters is the reliable function, not explicit deliberation.\n\n7. Conclusion  \n\nMoral worth does not require that the agent\u2019s first-order motives mirror every right-making feature. What it requires is reliable responsiveness to those features. A de dicto desire to do what is right, properly integrated with adequate moral understanding, secures that responsiveness and therefore suffices for moral worth. Far from being fetishistic, such a motive embodies respect, integrity, and robustness\u2014virtues that ground genuine praiseworthiness.", "output_tokens": 2552, "reasoning_tokens": 576}

Introduction and Thesis  \nOught moral admiration be reserved only for people moved by concrete, \u201cworld-directed\u201d concerns\u2014empathy for a friend\u2019s suffering, loyalty to a promise, love of justice? Many contemporary writers (e.g., Arpaly, Stocker, Wolf) answer affirmatively. They argue that an agent who acts from a merely abstract desire \u201cto do the morally right thing\u201d displays moral fetishism or alienation and therefore earns, at best, tepid praise. In reply, defenders of the de dicto motive (most prominently Markovits) have insisted that a pure concern with rightness can itself ground moral worth.\n\nI defend a qualified version of this latter view. Acting solely from the de dicto desire to do what is morally right can be fully morally worthy, provided (i) the agent\u2019s desire for rightness is non-instrumental and integrative\u2014it governs their deliberation in a way that coordinates rather than suppresses first-order values\u2014and (ii) the agent\u2019s sensitivity to rightness is suitably reliable and non-accidental. In short, what makes dutiful action praiseworthy is that it expresses an agent-centered commitment to the normative authority of morality, a commitment that itself embodies respect for persons and goods, albeit at a higher level of abstraction. The charge of fetishism rests on a misunderstanding of how second-order concern with morality can nest, rather than compete, with first-order concerns.\n\n2. Setting the Stage: De Dicto Versus De Re Motives  \nA de re motive is directed at a particular right-making consideration: I give back your book because it is yours (respect for property). A de dicto motive, by contrast, is directed at the fact that a certain act is morally right: I return the book simply because it is the right thing to do. The central worry is that de dicto agents, focusing on the property of rightness, treat concrete values as mere buttons to be pressed for a higher, perhaps aesthetic, satisfaction: \u201cAh, another moral requirement fulfilled!\u201d Hence \u201cmoral fetishism.\u201d\n\nYet we must distinguish:\n\na. Abstractness of content (my desire aims at \u201crightness\u201d)  \nb. Abstractness of epistemic route (I form the judgment that \u03c6 is right by armchair theorizing rather than empathetic perception)  \nc. Abstractness of emotional engagement (I feel no compassion, only cool resolve)\n\nOpponents of the de dicto often conflate these. One can have motive-type (a) while avoiding the alienation said to attend (b) or (c).\n\n3. Minimal Conditions on Moral Worth  \nAny adequate account of moral worth should explain three phenomena:\n\n(1) Responsiveness. Worthy action tracks moral reasons in a non-accidental way.  \n(2) Guidance Control. The reason\u2019s efficacy must flow through the agent\u2019s own capacities, not bypass them (e.g., hypnotic compulsion).  \n(3) Agential Expression. The motive should reveal something commendable about the person\u2019s character or practical identity.\n\nThe de dicto motive can satisfy all three once we grasp its internal structure.\n\n4. The Integrative De Dicto Desire  \nConsider the following mental economy, which I call Integrative Dutifulness:\n\nFirst-order layer: The agent has ordinary desires\u2014pleasure, friendship, curiosity, etc.  \nSecond-order layer: The agent has a standing commitment to doing what is morally right. This commitment operates as a \u201cconstitution-constraining principle\u201d (analogous to Rawlsian constitutional essentials): it instructs the agent to treat moral requirements as undefeated reasons.\n\nCrucially, the second-order desire neither obliterates nor ignores first-order concerns. Rather, it governs them by a principle of conditional authority: let any first-order motive speak, unless and until it conflicts with moral rightness. In that event, the second-order desire vetoes. On ordinary occasions, the agent\u2019s kindness or fidelity will coincide with morality, and she will act kindly or faithfully. But when conflict arises, she is prepared to sacrifice convenience, inclination, or even affection, because she endorses morality\u2019s authority over the entire field of reasons.\n\nThis structure mirrors the constitutional supremacy of law over day-to-day political preferences. Just as fidelity to the constitution is praiseworthy in a judge, fidelity to morality-as-such is praiseworthy in an agent, precisely because it is the principled way of honoring each person\u2019s equal moral standing.\n\n5. Fetishism Reconsidered  \nWhy is this not fetishistic? Because the de dicto agent does not value the property of \u201cbeing-right\u201d as one might value possessing baseball cards. She values it as the property whereby acts express respect for persons. In Kantian language, she \u201crecognizes the moral law as binding\u201d and thus, implicitly, recognizes every rational being as legislator and end. De dicto desire is an allegiance to that law, which is nothing other than the system of reasons constituted by everyone\u2019s claims.\n\nAn analogy: a scientist\u2019s second-order desire \u201cto believe what is scientifically justified\u201d is not epistemic fetishism; it is a metacognitive orientation that integrates first-order curiosity, observation, and inference. Similarly, a de dicto moral orientation integrates first-order compassion, fairness, and fidelity by treating them as the content that fills out \u201crightness.\u201d\n\n6. Examples Doing Real Work  \n(1) The Conscientious Juror. A juror, exhausted after weeks of testimony, is tempted to go home early. What keeps her in deliberation is not vivid sympathy for the defendant\u2014whose face she can barely recall\u2014but her vow \u201cto do my civic duty.\u201d She patiently weighs the evidence and helps avert a wrongful conviction. We praise her, not despite, but because of her abstract motive.\n\n(2) The Neutral Aid Worker. An aid worker administers vaccines in a refugee camp. She does not share a common language or culture with the children. Her immediate emotional response is muted; what moves her is the recognition that these strangers are owed equal concern by morality. Her deed seems eminently praiseworthy. The absence of concrete-affective ties does not mar its moral worth.\n\n(3) The Shopkeeper Revisited. Kant\u2019s famous shopkeeper charges honest prices \u201cfrom duty.\u201d Critics protest that if he were moved only by duty, we would distrust him. But note: we distrust the shopkeeper only if we imagine his dutifulness as brittle, perhaps cynical. Suppose instead he has a settled, integrative de dicto commitment. Then we admire him for refusing to overcharge tourists even when no one is watching.\n\n7. Reliability and Non-Accidentality  \nMere intention to do right is insufficient if the agent routinely misidentifies what rightness requires (the scrupulous fanatic). Moral worth arises when the de dicto disposition succeeds via reliable competence\u2014call it \u201cpractical moral epistemology.\u201d This mirrors intellectual worth: a desire for truth is admirable when coupled with reliable belief-forming methods. Thus requirement (ii) above: sensitivity must be competent, not lucky.\n\n8. Dialectical Engagement: Answering Five Objections\n\nObjection 1 (Stocker): De dicto motivation alienates friends, who rightly want to be loved for themselves.  \nReply: The integrative structure ensures that one\u2019s friends are loved for themselves; the second-order desire merely guarantees that this love never violates another\u2019s equal moral claim. My friend would resent me if I rescued her \u201conly because morality demands it\u201d when affection was available. But the presence of the de dicto motive does not preclude affection; it supplements it.\n\nObjection 2 (Arpaly): Huckleberry Finn, motivated by sympathy but believing rescue wrong, is more praiseworthy than the de dicto racist who frees Jim \u201cbecause abolition is right.\u201d  \nReply: Two points. (a) Moral worth is multi-dimensional; Huck\u2019s empathy displays a virtue the racist lacks. Yet the abolitionist\u2019s act, considered in isolation, still manifests a commendable respect for rightness, especially given the social cost of dissenting from pro-slavery norms. (b) Where Huck\u2019s conscience is corrupted by mis-education, his good-hearted response evidences a different virtue\u2014responsiveness to pro tanto moral reasons he mistakenly classifies. Both cases reveal how diverse virtues can ground worth. They are not mutually exclusive counter-examples.\n\nObjection 3: De dicto agents face moral overload and paralysis, constantly calculating the right.  \nReply: They need not. A settled disposition can function heuristically: absent defeaters, follow benevolent inclinations; when moral uncertainty looms, slow down. This is the same pattern responsible scientists or doctors exhibit in their domains.\n\nObjection 4: The motive seems cold or joyless.  \nReply: Nothing in the de dicto desire entails emotional poverty. Respect for rightness can itself be affectively rich: pride in justice, satisfaction in integrity, indignation at wrong. Moreover, one can simultaneously experience neighbor-directed compassion.\n\nObjection 5: The view collapses into a Kantian formalism disconnected from lived goods.  \nReply: On the contrary, the integrative model understands moral rightness as constituted by the very considerations opponents defend (welfare, autonomy, fidelity). The agent\u2019s abstract desire simply anchors those considerations within a higher-order commitment to universality and impartiality.\n\n9. Precision in Distinctions  \nI have emphasized three distinctions often blurred in this debate:\n\n(i) Motive-type versus affect-profile: A de dicto motive need not be affect-free.  \n(ii) Content-level versus epistemic-method: Caring about rightness does not entail theorizing about it.  \n(iii) Second-order governance versus first-order exclusion: A priority rule is not an eliminative rule.\n\nMaintaining these distinctions dissolves much of the intuitive charge of fetishism.\n\n10. Substantive Contribution: The Civic Analogy  \nMy proposal models the moral agent on a civic republican. A republican citizen esteems the constitution not for its parchment texture but because it institutionalizes equal liberty. Likewise, the de dicto motive esteems \u201cmoral rightness\u201d because it institutionalizes equal moral status. This analogy clarifies two issues:\n\n(a) Why the motive is non-fetishistic: what is loved is not a mysterious property but the public framework ensuring everyone\u2019s claims are fairly adjudicated.  \n(b) Why the motive is crucial in moments of conflict: just as constitutional fidelity tempers populist passions, duty tempers partiality.\n\n11. Relation to Alternative Accounts  \nVirtue ethics: The integrative de dicto motive is compatible with virtue. It acts as an architectonic virtue\u2014not a rival\u2014ensuring that courage, generosity, and fidelity operate within rightful bounds.\n\nScanlonian contractualism: To judge an act \u201cright\u201d is to see it as unrejectable by reasonable persons. A de dicto desire to do what is right therefore embodies universal concern, albeit indirectly.\n\nKant: My view vindicates Kant\u2019s claim that only actions done from duty have \u201cmoral worth\u201d but refines it: worth attaches because duty expresses respect for persons, not because of metaphysical formality.\n\n12. Limits and Further Questions  \nTwo limits deserve acknowledgment. First, in certain intimate contexts (romantic love, parent-child bonding) we expect primary acknowledgment of concrete concern, with duty as back-up. Whether failure to manifest the favored \u201cforeground\u201d motive diminishes worth is an open question. Second, cultural and epistemic constraints affect the reliability of de dicto guidance. Future work might explore institutional supports (education, deliberative forums) that help duty fulfill its promise.\n\n13. Conclusion  \nActing solely from the desire to do what is morally right can indeed confer full moral worth. When that desire (i) is non-instrumental and integrative, (ii) manifests reliable sensitivity to moral reasons, and (iii) expresses respect for persons through allegiance to morality\u2019s authority, the resulting action exemplifies moral excellence rather than fetishism. The appearance of cold abstraction dissolves once we recognize that \u201crightness\u201d is merely the systematic face of the very concrete values everyone already agrees matter. Far from alienating us from morality\u2019s point, dutiful action secures it: it is the agent\u2019s steadfast way of treating all persons\u2014ourselves included\u2014as ends whose claims set the terms of rightful action.\n\nApprox. 2,050 words", "output_tokens": 3176, "reasoning_tokens": 512}

Introduction and Statement of Thesis  \n\nMost people who do the right thing do so for concrete reasons: they give to Oxfam because they see the misery of famine victims, or they return a lost wallet because they imagine the owner\u2019s distress.  By contrast, the agent who says simply \u201cI did it because it was the morally right thing to do\u201d can sound chilly, even fetishistic.  Contemporary critics\u2014from Michael Smith\u2019s\u2010style \u201cmoral fetishism\u201d charge, through Susan Wolf\u2019s worry about \u201cmoral saints,\u201d to Railton\u2019s and Slote\u2019s \u201calienation\u201d concerns\u2014argue that the motive of duty, understood as a de dicto desire to do whatever morality requires, cannot by itself ground moral worth.  They insist that praiseworthy agents must be moved by the concrete considerations that make their acts right, not by the bare idea of rightness.  \n\nI shall defend the opposite view.  A de dicto desire to do whatever is morally required can, by itself, suffice for moral worth.  In such cases the source of praiseworthiness is the agent\u2019s commitment to the authority of morality itself\u2014a commitment that (i) embodies respect for others as rational equals, (ii) enables reliable responsiveness to right\u2010making considerations across situations, and (iii) displays a form of moral self\u2010governance that is necessary for full moral agency.  While concrete, de re concerns often enrich motivation, they are not conceptually or normatively required for an action to be morally worthy.  Indeed, an exclusive insistence on de re motivation smuggles in questionable empirical assumptions about human psychology and overlooks how moral learning, deliberative uncertainty, and structural injustice can make the abstract motive of duty the best\u2014or even the only\u2014uncompromised route to doing what is right.  \n\nThe argument proceeds in five stages.  Section 2 clarifies the distinction between de dicto and de re moral motivation and introduces a neglected middle category: higher\u2010order de dicto regulation of lower\u2010order de re motives.  Section 3 diagnoses the \u201cmoral fetishism\u201d objection and shows why it relies on an implausibly narrow picture of moral psychology.  Section 4 develops a positive Kantian account of why the abstract motive of duty is itself valuable and not alienating.  Section 5 replies to three leading objections\u2014that duty motivation is (A) motivationally anemic, (B) epistemically blind, and (C) emotionally impoverished\u2014using historical examples and thought experiments to show how duty\u2010only motivation can in fact excel on each dimension.  Section 6 draws the upshot: moral worth attaches to the quality of volitional governance, not to the phenomenology of one\u2019s concrete sentiments.\n\n2. De dicto versus de re\u2014and a Third Alternative  \n\nThe standard contrast is familiar.  \n\nDe re moral motivation: the agent acts from a desire concerning the very property that makes the act right (e.g., \u201cI give money because it will relieve Julio\u2019s suffering\u201d).  \n\nDe dicto moral motivation: the agent acts from a desire that the act be morally right, without particular concern for the right\u2010making property (e.g., \u201cI give because it\u2019s the morally required thing to do\u201d).  \n\nCritics treat these as exhaustive, but there is a third, hybrid form:  \n\nHigher\u2010order de dicto regulation: the agent is moved by concrete de re motives (empathy, fairness, charity) but is disposed to screen, endorse, or override those motives by reference to the de dicto desire to comply with morality.  Call this \u201cregulated de re motivation.\u201d  \n\nThe hybrid model shows that a de dicto desire can structure an agent\u2019s motivational set without itself supplying a vivid first\u2010order sentiment.  This undermines the fetishism charge (which targets the picture of a lone, icy, de dicto motive) by revealing how, psychologically, the de dicto motive often functions as a governing commitment, not as a monotonous substitute for ordinary sentiments.  But for the purposes of the present essay I want to make the stronger claim: even when the de dicto desire operates alone\u2014as it sometimes does\u2014it can confer full moral worth.\n\n3. What Exactly Is Moral Fetishism?\n\nSmith\u2019s complaint is that the duty\u2010fixated agent treats the property of being right as if it had an intrinsic magnetism, fetishizing an abstract quality while remaining indifferent to the human goods at stake.  But this diagnosis trades on an analogy to sexual fetishism that fails on three grounds.\n\nFirst, the fetishist is captivated by an accidental property (e.g., a shoe) while ignoring the person; the dutiful agent is captivated by the property that makes the act obligatory\u2014morality itself\u2014not by an accidental feature.  Respecting morality is not a distraction from what matters morally; it is an explicit affirmation of it.\n\nSecond, fetishism is marked by compulsive affect; the duty\u2010motivated agent\u2019s concern is principled and reflective.  The criticism confuses principled impartiality with pathological obsession.\n\nThird, the charge presupposes that the de dicto desire crowds out de re concerns.  Empirically this is dubious.  One can be moved solely by duty in a given circumstance (because concrete sympathy is absent) without being globally indifferent to others\u2019 welfare.  A surgeon exhausted after a 20\u2010hour shift may wash before operating \u201cbecause it\u2019s the right thing to do,\u201d even though she presently feels no vivid concern for the next patient.  Nothing fetishistic here\u2014just professional integrity in attenuating circumstances.\n\nThus the fetishism objection rests on caricature.  The duty\u2010only motive need not reflect indifference to concrete goods; it can reflect principled governance when other motives are silent, overwhelmed, or corrupted.\n\n4. Why the Abstract Motive of Duty Is Morally Valuable\n\nKant\u2019s groundwork provides the canonical defense: acting from duty displays respect for the moral law and hence for persons as ends in themselves.  Critics often recite this but miss three points.\n\n4.1. Authority and Equal Status  \n\nThe de dicto desire implicitly acknowledges that no individual\u2019s partial perspective, not even one\u2019s own, has ultimate authority.  To act because something is morally required is to act under a law one gives to oneself in concert with all rational beings.  This expresses equal moral respect in a way that purely sentimental concern cannot, because sentiments track partiality (we feel more empathy for the near, the familiar, the lovable).  The duty motive therefore has an egalitarian meaning that ordinary de re motives lack.\n\n4.2. Reliability Across Contexts  \n\nA second virtue is diachronic and cross\u2010situational reliability.  Concrete motives are situation\u2010specific and easily hijacked by salience effects, framing, and prejudice.  The abstract commitment to do what morality requires can trigger right action in contexts where the relevant suffering is invisible, where no personal relationship cues special concern, or where unjust social norms dampen sympathetic imagination.  The 19th\u2010century abolitionist who refuses to keep slaves because \u201cit is wrong, full stop,\u201d despite having been raised in a culture that normalizes slavery, illustrates how de dicto motivation can outperform sentimental concern that has been socially conditioned to favor only certain victims.\n\n4.3. Autonomy and Self\u2010Governance  \n\nFinally, duty motivation realizes a distinctive form of practical freedom: the ability to act for reasons that one can endorse under critical reflection, independent of contingent drives.  This autonomy itself has moral value.  A world where agents saved drowning children solely because they happened to feel strong empathy would be welcome, but one where they saved children even when exhausted, resentful, or emotionally numb\u2014because \u201cit is the right thing to do\u201d\u2014exhibits a deeper kind of moral agency, one less hostage to vagaries of temperament.\n\n5. Replies to Three Objections  \n\nObjection A: Motivational Anemia (\u201cduty alone won\u2019t get you off the couch\u201d).  \nReply: Empirical studies on \u201crule internalization\u201d and \u201cprofessional role morality\u201d show that abstract normative commitments can reliably motivate costly actions\u2014in soldiers who leap on grenades, in judges who recuse themselves despite personal loss, in whistle\u2010blowers who forgo lucrative careers.  These are not cases of warm concern for concrete victims; often the victims are faceless.  Yet the actions are morally heroic.  The claim that the abstract motive is too weak is a descriptive conjecture belied by real human behavior.\n\nObjection B: Epistemic Blindness (\u201cwithout de re concern you can\u2019t see what morality demands\u201d).  \nReply: The objection confuses the epistemic role of emotions with their motivational role.  Sympathy can be an evidential aid in recognizing that an act would relieve suffering, but once that fact is known, the motive of duty can supply the practical impetus.  Moreover, the duty motive can recruit epistemic tools\u2014consultation, deliberation, moral theory\u2014to determine rightness where emotions mislead.  Again, the abolitionist\u2019s insight depended not on feeling the slave\u2019s pain (many did not) but on grasping the contradiction in the institution relative to equal freedom.  Far from being blind, the duty motive can widen moral vision by checking partiality.\n\nObjection C: Emotional Impoverishment (\u201cduty motivation lacks the warm affect we admire\u201d).  \nReply: Moral worth is not identical with moral beauty.  An agent can be praiseworthy without being charming.  We should separate (i) the aesthetic value of moral emotions from (ii) the ethical value of principled action.  In crisis contexts\u2014triage medicine, disaster response\u2014the agent\u2019s emotional palette may be numb or stressed, yet her duty\u2010driven actions remain laudable.  Indeed we sometimes *prefer* such self\u2010disciplined agents; a judge who sentences a guilty friend may feel agony, but if empathy swayed her to acquit she would fail in her duty.  The cool motive can be more trustworthy.\n\n6. Testing the Thesis: Historical and Hypothetical Cases  \n\nCase 1: The \u201cQuiet Rescuer\u201d in Occupied France  \nYvonne Beauvais hid Jewish families though she felt no special affection for them and was terrified of reprisal.  Her diary: \u201cOne must do what God and Right demand.\u201d  Post\u2010war reflections hail her as a righteous person, despite her admission that fear drowned out feelings of empathy.  Moral worth seems intact.\n\nCase 2: The \u201cDecolonizing Bureaucrat\u201d  \nSuppose a colonial officer in 1946 Britain reads a parliamentary report concluding that continued imperial rule violates basic self\u2010determination.  He has no emotional ties to Indian villagers but resigns, explaining, \u201cI could not in conscience enforce a policy I now see as unjust.\u201d  His act stems from duty, not sentiment, yet is clearly praiseworthy.\n\nCase 3: The \u201cSaturation Surgeon\u201d  \nAn emergency surgeon, after twelve hours of amputations following an earthquake, feels nothing but exhaustion.  She scrubs for the next operation out of professional duty.  Her affective exhaustion is the very condition under which the duty motive shows its moral worth; it carries her through when compassion is temporarily spent.\n\nThese cases exhibit what we revere: steadfastness to principle amid fear, fatigue, or indifference.  If the critics were right, we would withhold praise; yet the intuitive verdict goes the other way.\n\n7. Reconciling De Dicto and De Re: Two Modest Claims  \n\nOne need not deny the moral value of concrete motives.  My defense of duty motivation implies two more modest theses:\n\nIntegration Thesis: The most robustly virtuous characters harmonize de re sentiments under the governance of a de dicto commitment.  Thus de dicto motivation is at least necessary for fully developed virtue, even if not always alone sufficient for action.\n\nSufficiency Thesis: In any given action, the presence of de dicto motivation alone can secure moral worth when (a) the agent\u2019s belief about what morality requires is true, and (b) the motivation issues in right action intentionally.  De re motives are optional bonuses, not requirements.\n\n8. Conclusion  \n\nThe suspicion of an exclusive duty motive stems, I have argued, from conflating vivid sentiment with moral seriousness.  Abstract commitment to rightness is neither fetishistic nor alienating; it is an expression of respect for the equal authority of the moral law, a safeguard against partiality, and a source of autonomy.  When concrete sentiments fail\u2014because bias, distance, fatigue, or social corruption dampens them\u2014the motive of duty can stand alone and still render conduct fully praiseworthy.  Far from being a second\u2010best, it is often the mark of the highest moral agency.", "output_tokens": 2867, "reasoning_tokens": 192}

Setting the Stage: What Is at Issue?\n\nWhen Kant writes that only an act \u201cfrom duty\u201d has moral worth, he is commonly read as endorsing a distinctive motive: the agent acts because she recognizes that what she is about to do is morally required. That motive, call it the de dicto desire to do what is right (I shall abbreviate it DD-desire), is contrasted with a de re concern for the right-making features of the situation\u2014e.g., another person\u2019s pain, the unfairness of a distribution, the mendacity of a promise. Contemporary critics (most prominently Michael Smith, Jonathan Dancy, and Kieran Setiya) object that the DD-desire looks fetishistic: the dutiful agent seems weirdly focused on a property\u2014rightness\u2014as such, rather than the human needs or values that make the act right. A morally mature person, they insist, should be motivated directly by those values; someone who merely wants \u201cto do the right thing\u201d stands at one remove from what morality is really about and so fails to earn full moral credit.\n\nMy thesis is twofold.\n\n(1) Contrary to the fetishism charge, a pure DD-desire can in principle suffice for moral worth.\n\n(2) The key to its praiseworthiness lies not in its abstract content but in its functional role: it expresses the agent\u2019s recognition of morality\u2019s authority and her rational commitment to act accordingly. When that commitment is exercised competently\u2014that is, when the agent identifies the right act because she competently traces how the concrete right-makers bear on her situation\u2014the action is fully worthy of moral praise.\n\nI proceed as follows. \u00a72 clarifies the concepts of motive and moral worth. \u00a73 develops a positive argument for the sufficiency of a DD-desire. \u00a74 faces three central objections: fetishism, alienation, and motivational fragility. \u00a75 introduces two illustrative examples\u2014a conscientious lifeguard and a bigoted but self-reflective shopkeeper\u2014to show how the account handles real-world cases. \u00a76 locates the view in recent literature and draws out broader implications. I conclude in \u00a77.\n\n2. Clarifying the Terrain\n\n2.1. Motive vs. Right-Maker  \nRight-making considerations are facts in virtue of which an act is morally required or permitted: that rescuing a drowning child prevents grave harm, that repaying a debt keeps a promise, etc. Motives are psychological states that move an agent to act. A moralized psychology tends to map motives onto right-makers: caring about the child\u2019s welfare leads one to rescue her. The DD-desire, by contrast, has the schematic content \u201cact as morality requires,\u201d leaving the right-makers unspecified.\n\n2.2. Moral Worth  \nWe praise acts for two dimensions: (a) objective rightness (did the agent do what morality demands?) and (b) moral worth (was the act motivated in a morally appropriate way?). Kant\u2019s paradigm is the honest shopkeeper who charges fair prices from self-interest (objectively right but not morally worthy) versus the shopkeeper who does so from duty (both right and worthy). Many contemporary theorists accept a two-tier structure though they reject Kant\u2019s restrictive criterion.\n\n2.3. De dicto vs. De re Desire  \nThe de dicto/de re distinction applies to the way a desire represents its object. Suppose Maggie desires to drink the liquid in the glass. De re: she desires of that very substance that she drink it; de dicto: she desires to drink \u201cthe refreshing beverage,\u201d a description under which she conceives it. A desire to do what morality requires is de dicto in this sense: its object is whatever act fits the description \u201cmorally right.\u201d Importantly, that does not prevent Maggie from consulting the world to see which concrete act matches the description.\n\n3. The Positive Case for Dutiful Motivation\n\n3.1. The Rational Agency Argument  \nStep 1. Rational agency is guided by practical principles that are, at some level, content-general. To become an agent at all is to commit oneself to acting for reasons.  \nStep 2. Morality, if authoritative, supplies reasons that are categorically binding. Recognizing that authority naturally gives rise to a standing policy: \u201cDo what morality requires.\u201d  \nStep 3. A rational agent who forms and acts on that policy manifests a distinctive virtue\u2014respect for the moral law. In a slogan: rational recognition of moral reasons is itself reason-giving.  \nStep 4. Therefore, when such an agent acts from the DD-desire, she exhibits a virtuous form of practical rationality; the act therefore possesses moral worth.\n\n3.2. Competence Condition  \nThe DD-desire confers worth only if it is exercised competently: the agent must identify what morality in fact requires and adjust her action accordingly. Compare: a physician motivated by concern for her patient\u2019s health acts with professional worth only if she diagnoses correctly. Moral competence includes sensitivity to the concrete welfare, rights, and relationships that ground the moral requirement. If the agent reaches the right act by wishful thinking or lucky guess, her motive is epistemically defective and so diminished in worth. That caveat answers the worry that a bare schematic desire floats free of the right-makers; correct linkage is demanded.\n\n3.3. The Expressivist Rationale  \nOn a familiar insight from Frankfurt and Moran, actions can express who one is: they manifest practical identity. Acting from the DD-desire expresses the identity of one who takes morality to be a supreme normative authority. That expressivist dimension grounds desert of praise: we honor agents who embody moral commitment in this deep sense.\n\n4. Objections and Replies\n\n4.1. The Fetishism Charge  \nCritics liken the dutiful agent to a collector who values a postage stamp not for its artistry or its history but solely because it is \u201crare.\u201d The content \u201cdoing the right thing\u201d seems equally abstract and fetishistic. But the analogy misfires. A fetish object is valued for an accidental property without regard to what grounds that property. In the moral case, however, rightness is not an accidental label; it is systematically connected to the concrete features that make acts right. Valuing rightness therefore entails valuing an abstract property whose extension is fixed by those features. To fetishize X is to be indifferent to what makes something X; the dutiful agent, being committed to tracking rightness correctly, must care about those concrete grounds at the level of practical deliberation. Thus the DD-desire is not fetishistic provided it is operationalized via competent identification of right-makers.\n\n4.2. The Alienation Worry  \nBernard Williams famously warns against a morality that \u201calienates\u201d us from our projects and sentiments. Might the DD-desire crowd out the agent\u2019s sympathy, love, and other humanly rich motives? Two points: (a) Sufficiency is not exclusivity. Saying the DD-desire can suffice for worth does not preclude additional motives. A father who saves his child \u201cbecause it is morally required\u201d acts praiseworthily even if he lacks affection\u2014though we may fault him on other grounds. (b) In actual agents, the DD-desire typically integrates with first-order sentiments; it frames them rather than replaces them. Choosing to help a friend because it is right need not alienate me from her suffering; indeed, recognizing rightness often sharpens attention to those very sentiments. So alienation is neither necessary nor typical.\n\n4.3. The Fragility Objection  \nBecause the DD-desire is second-order, it might seem motivationally fragile: in emotionally intense contexts, only direct concern for the victim\u2019s pain will have sufficient oomph. Empirical evidence is mixed: some agents (Kantian principled resisters) do heroic deeds under severe stress. But more philosophically, sufficiency for worth does not entail superiority in reliability. Courage is praiseworthy even if rare; likewise a purely dutiful motive can be worthy even if many humans cannot sustain it.\n\n5. Two Illustrative Cases\n\n5.1. The Conscientious Lifeguard  \nSara is a professional lifeguard. During her shift she regularly scans the water, not from spontaneous bursts of empathy toward particular swimmers, but because she has internalized a policy: \u201cFulfill my moral-professional duty to keep patrons safe.\u201d One afternoon she spots a child struggling and dives in. Her sole motivating thought is: \u201cIt\u2019s my duty to rescue.\u201d Is her act worthy? On the present account: yes. Her DD-desire is exercised competently (she perceives the concrete danger), it expresses respect for life and professional obligation, and it guides effective action. Intuitively, we praise Sara.\n\nWhat if Sara had instead been moved by affection for that particular child\u2019s laughter? That might seem warmer, but warmth is not the criterion of moral worth. The child\u2019s welfare is secured in either case; the moral credit Sara earns stems from her steadfast commitment to duty.\n\n5.2. The Bigoted but Self-Reflective Shopkeeper  \nCall him Al. Al harbors racist antipathy that makes him averse to serving clients of a certain group. Over time he comes to acknowledge, resentfully, that such discrimination is morally wrong. Wanting \u201cto do the morally right thing,\u201d he suppresses his bigoted impulses and serves everyone equally. Al\u2019s motive is purely dutiful; he feels no goodwill toward the disfavored group. Do we praise him? Common intuition: grudgingly yes. Moral progress sometimes begins with reluctant duty. My account validates that intuition: Al\u2019s action has moral worth because the DD-desire successfully counters immoral inclinations. Worth is not maximal\u2014he lacks the virtue of respect for persons at the emotional level\u2014but it is genuine. Importantly, insisting that only de re concern for the customer\u2019s dignity confers worth would condemn Al, thereby making moral improvement unduly demanding.\n\n6. Situating the View in Contemporary Debate\n\n6.1. Herman\u2019s Patient and Korsgaard\u2019s Reflexivity  \nBarbara Herman argues that agents should be moved by the right-makers because practical reasoning is situated; attention to the concrete values keeps morality vivid. Christine Korsgaard replies that the kind of reflective endorsement that constitutes autonomy operates at the level of principle. My view aligns more with Korsgaard: respect for moral law as such expresses autonomy. Yet I incorporate Herman\u2019s insight via the competence condition: only by attending to right-makers can an agent reliably execute the DD-desire.\n\n6.2. Arpaly and Motivational Harmony  \nNomy Arpaly holds that moral worth accrues when an agent is responsive to moral reasons de re, whether or not she conceptualizes them as such. That allows Huck Finn\u2019s rescue of Jim to be praiseworthy even though Huck misclassifies it as wrong. My account does not denigrate Huck; it simply offers an additional route to worth. There is no competition: responsiveness can be de re or de dicto. So we gain an inclusive account that captures a wider range of intuitions.\n\n6.3. Hybrid, Not Monistic  \nI resist the temptation to claim that only DD-motivation or only de re motivation suffices. Morality is pluralistic in the kinds of motivational grounding it tolerates. The sufficiency thesis is modest: DD-motivation is one legitimate ground of moral worth.\n\n7. Conclusion\n\nActing from a desire to do what is morally right can indeed suffice for moral worth. The decisive factor is not the abstractness of the desire but (i) its expressive function\u2014affirming morality\u2019s authority\u2014and (ii) the agent\u2019s competence in linking that desire to the concrete right-making facts. When those two conditions obtain, the charge of fetishism collapses, alienation is optional rather than inherent, and the motivational pathway is robust enough to ground deserved praise.\n\nIn a moral landscape where agents vary widely\u2014some sentimental, some principled, some conflicted\u2014such inclusivity matters. A theory that demands perfectly virtuous sentiments for worth would exclude transitional agents laboring to overcome prejudice or weakness of will; conversely, a theory that valorizes only duty ignores the rich texture of human concern. Recognizing the sufficiency of the DD-desire supplements but does not eclipse other sources of moral worth. It reminds us that taking morality seriously, as morality, is itself a profound achievement of rational agency.", "output_tokens": 2991, "reasoning_tokens": 384}

Introduction and Thesis\n\nSuppose a nurse administers a painful injection to a child. She steels herself, reminding herself simply that it is morally required, even though the screams distress her. She does not, in that moment, feel sympathy for the child or think about the long\u2010range epidemiology of measles; what pushes her is a stark, \u201cThis is the right thing to do\u2014so do it.\u201d Is her motive adequate for moral worth? I shall defend a qualified Yes: a de dicto desire to do what is morally right can by itself ground praiseworthy action, provided (i) the agent is capable of identifying what is right on suitable grounds and (ii) the desire functions as an exercise of respect for the authority of morality rather than as a mere psychological quirk. On this view, moral worth lies not in the presence of warm fellow\u2010feeling but in the practical rational self\u2010governance that a duty\u2010centered motive expresses.\n\nI proceed as follows. \u00a72 distinguishes three kinds of moral motivation and locates the dispute. \u00a73 sets out the \u201cmoral fetishism\u201d objection, canvassing the arguments of Stocker, Smith, Wolf and Railton. \u00a74 reconstructs Kant\u2019s classic reply: when other motives conflict or go missing, the pure motive of duty displays the agent\u2019s moral commitment. \u00a75 develops a contemporary version of that reply. I argue that the de dicto desire to do the right thing (A) is not empty but imports the whole structure of first\u2010order moral reasons, (B) embodies a second\u2010order capacity that is uniquely valuable, and (C) meets the alienation worry once we attend to how it operates diachronically across cases. \u00a76 addresses two further objections\u2014coldness and epistemic luck\u2014and \u00a77 concludes.\n\n2. Three Kinds of Moral Motivation\n\nWe need sharper distinctions than those usually offered.\n\n1. Concrete de re desire: An affective or practical attraction toward the very features that make the act right\u2014e.g., \u201cbecause it relieves her suffering.\u201d  \n2. Abstract de dicto desire: A desire aimed at the property of rightness\u2014\u201cbecause it is morally right, whatever that turns out to be in this case.\u201d  \n3. Reflective (second\u2010order) endorsement: A standing commitment to regulate one\u2019s will by what one judges right, regardless of what specific features ground that judgment.\n\nThe critics target (2), claiming that (1) or at least a combination of (1) and (3) is required for moral worth. Defenders of Kant hold that (2) together with (3) can suffice. My thesis is that (2) can carry the whole normative burden if it is understood as operating through (3).\n\n3. The Fetishism and Alienation Objections\n\nMichael Stocker\u2019s \u201cSchizophrenia of Modern Ethical Theories\u201d inaugurates the worry: an honest friend who visits you only because it is his duty seems defective; we want him to come out of affection. Simon Keller\u2019s dutiful husband, Susan Wolf\u2019s moral saint, Mark Schroeder\u2019s Huckleberry Finn in reverse\u2014all aim to show that a purely duty\u2010oriented agent is missing the point of morality. The charge bifurcates:\n\n(a) Fetishism: The agent fetishizes the abstract property of rightness, neglecting the substantive values that make the act right.  \n(b) Alienation: By focusing on duty, the agent stands at a distance from her own projects and from the lives of others; her motive cannot intelligibly connect to what matters.\n\n4. Kant\u2019s Embryonic Reply\n\nAt crucial moments in the Groundwork, Kant insists that only actions \u201cfrom duty\u201d have moral worth. Commentators like Barbara Herman clarify that what matters is not coldness but rather the form of practical necessitation. If sympathy or prudence would have led one to the same act, we have no proof that the will is governed by respect for the moral law. This is not to denigrate sympathy; it is to say that respect for law shows its distinctive worth precisely when the law alone moves us. The moral fetishism objection worries that this turns the law into an idol. Kant\u2019s deeper point is that the law is not one value among others: it is the formal principle that binds values into reasons for all rational beings.\n\n5. A Contemporary Defense\n\nA. De dicto motivation imports de re reasons  \nThink of the ancient astronomer who wants \u201cto believe what is true.\u201d That desire is de dicto, yet to pursue it he must acquaint himself with planets, telescopes, and mathematics. Likewise, to act on the desire to \u201cdo the right thing\u201d I must expose myself to the facts that make actions right\u2014needs, welfare, justice, autonomy. The de dicto desire therefore channels me toward the very features critics fear it neglects. It is a regulating motive that continually reopens inquiry into what rightness demands.\n\nB. Second\u2010order governance as distinctive value  \nHarry Frankfurt showed that agency involves a hierarchy of desires; moral worth, I submit, attaches to an agent\u2019s capacity to govern first\u2010order impulses by reflective commitment. The de dicto desire does precisely this. It is content\u2010free enough to be portable across contexts, yet contentful enough\u2014because \u201crightness\u201d is not arbitrary\u2014to anchor deliberation. An agent who acts from this desire therefore manifests a special kind of reliability: she will do what morality requires even when local sympathies mislead or desert her.\n\nC. Meeting the alienation worry  \nRailton\u2019s alienation critique presumes a snapshot perspective: we imagine the agent\u2019s motive in one episode. Take a diachronic view. Over a life, feelings are fickle. Sometimes anger, exhaustion, or depression erode empathy. At those times, the agent guided by duty alone still visits the hospital, still tells the painful truth, still refrains from cruelty. Far from alienating her from what matters, the motive of duty reconciles her day\u2010to\u2010day conduct with her deepest evaluative commitments. It is the cement of identity over time, not an external constraint.\n\n6. Two Remaining Objections\n\ni. \u201cThe dutiful agent is emotionally cold.\u201d  \nReply: Nothing in having the de dicto motive precludes also having warm concern. My claim is about sufficiency, not exclusivity. Moreover, some emotional distance may be morally salutary. The nurse\u2019s composure shields the child from panic. Coldness is blameworthy only when it signals indifference, not when it is the by\u2010product of impartial self\u2010command.\n\nii. \u201cEpistemic luck: An agent could fetishize rightness yet blunder about.\u201d  \nTrue, one can fetishize without understanding. But moral worth requires competence: the agent must reliably track what is right. That condition is implicit in any plausible theory; mere good intentions coupled with consistent mistake generate excuse, not praise. The objection therefore targets a straw man.\n\n7. Conclusion\n\nActing solely from the desire to do what is morally right can, and sometimes must, suffice for moral worth. What makes such action praiseworthy is not any sentimental resonance with the concrete values at stake but the agent\u2019s exercise of reflective self\u2010governance\u2014her respect for the moral law as law. Far from being a fetish, the de dicto motive is the lynchpin that integrates shifting first\u2010order motives into a stable moral identity.", "output_tokens": 1992, "reasoning_tokens": 448}

Framing the Question  \n\nIn the contemporary debate about moral motivation, two pictures compete.  \nPicture A: The morally admirable agent is moved by the very considerations that make an act right\u2014hurt is bad, promises create expectations, generosity relieves need, and so on. Here motivation is de re: the agent wants, of those actions, the ones that relieve need, keep promises, respect persons, etc.  \nPicture B: The admirable agent might instead be moved by the abstract thought that \u201cthis is the right thing to do.\u201d Here the desire is de dicto: to perform whatever act, whichever one it is, that morality requires.\n\nMany worry that Picture B amounts to \u201cmoral fetishism.\u201d A person who acts only because \u201cit is required\u201d seems alienated both from the human beings benefitted and from the concrete values at stake. We praise the friend who visits you in hospital because she cares about you, it is said, not the one who drops by merely because \u201cit\u2019s the morally right thing to do.\u201d\n\nI shall defend the following thesis.  \n\nThesis: Acting solely from a de dicto desire to do what is morally right can by itself confer full moral worth, provided (i) the desire is integrated into the agent\u2019s practical deliberation in a way that renders her reliably sensitive to the right-making features of actions, and (ii) the desire expresses a rational recognition of morality\u2019s authority rather than a pathological need for moral correctness. Moral fetishism is therefore not the inevitable consequence of de dicto motivation; the decisive issue is how the abstract desire is embedded in the agent\u2019s rational psychology.\n\nThe defence proceeds in six stages:\n\n2. Key Distinctions  \n3. Three Arguments for the Sufficiency of the Duty Motive  \n4. Replies to the Alienation and Fetishism Objections  \n5. Why De Dicto Motivation Remains Praiseworthy Even When Other Motives Are Available  \n6. Two Clarifying Examples  \n7. Limits and Residual Questions  \n\n2. Key Distinctions\n\n2.1 De dicto vs. de re desires  \nA de re desire \u201cto help this wounded stranger\u201d targets some determinate state of affairs; a de dicto desire \u201cto do what morality requires\u201d is schematic. But the two are not exclusive. The de dicto desire often functions at a higher, architects\u2019 level: once I settle that assisting the stranger is demanded, the de re project specifies means and details.\n\n2.2 Standing vs. occurrent motive  \nOne might possess a standing de dicto commitment yet act in the moment from compassion. Conversely, a person whose emotions are exhausted might fall back on the standing commitment. Moral worth attaches primarily to the motivational profile that actually moves the agent on the occasion.\n\n2.3 Conative vs. cognitive fetishism  \nIt is one thing to value only the moral property (fetishism about what is valued); another to value ordinary things but need the moral property as a cognitive trigger (fetishism about what explains one\u2019s action). Critics often conflate the two. My thesis only concerns the second: the agent\u2019s entry point into deliberation.\n\n3. Three Arguments for the Sufficiency of Duty as Motive\n\n3.1 The Argument from Rational Authority  \nMorality purports to speak with overriding normative force. An agent who recognizes and responds to that authority, exactly as such, manifests a distinctive form of rational excellence: she allows herself to be guided by what she has most reason to do, period. That responsiveness is what Kant called \u201cgood will.\u201d Praiseworthiness tracks the exercise of a capacity that everyone ought to cultivate\u2014the capacity to see and to do what must be done because it must be done. Whether the authority reaches the agent through de re or de dicto channels is secondary; what matters is the rational submission itself.\n\n3.2 The Reliability Argument  \nFirst-order motives (sympathy, friendship, aesthetic delight) are circumstantially fragile. Affection cools, attention wanders, biases intrude. A higher-order de dicto commitment functions as a stabiliser. An agent who acts from duty alone is disposed to act rightly across a wider range of cases\u2014including those where concrete sentiment is absent or counter-motivating. Reliability with respect to moral reasons is itself an excellence we have good grounds to admire.\n\n3.3 The Epistemic Argument  \nTo turn the de dicto desire into action the agent must ask: \u201cWhich act, here and now, is the right one?\u201d That question forces her to track the very considerations the critic says she ignores. The epistemic route from abstract desire to concrete choice runs through the right-making features. Hence acting from duty need not involve motivational blindness to concrete values; the route might be purely instrumental, yet the resulting sensitivity is genuine.\n\n4. Replies to the Alienation and Fetishism Objections\n\nObjection 1: The hospital visitor who comes \u201cbecause it is right\u201d seems chilly; she fails to value the friend for her own sake.  \nReply: Two confusions lurk. (a) The alleged chilliness is a phenomenological datum, not a moral one. We welcome warmth, but moral worth concerns what reasons one responds to, not what emotional colour accompanies the action. (b) Even if the visitor\u2019s occurrent desire is de dicto, she need not lack affection or appreciation; she may simply find, on this occasion, that duty provides the motivational edge needed to overcome competing pulls (fatigue, deadlines, social anxiety). Kant\u2019s own examples\u2014of the melancholy philanthropist who gives out of duty when compassion has withered\u2014are precisely cases where duty preserves value that sentimentalist motives might forfeit.\n\nObjection 2: De dicto motivation is a \u201cmoral fetish\u201d; the agent fetishises the moral property the way a collector fetishises stamps, valuing them not for their historical significance but for their being stamps.  \nReply: The analogy misfires. The stamp fetishist\u2019s desire bypasses the reasons stamps might matter (history, artistry). In contrast, the de dicto-motivated agent is committed to acting in accordance with whatever reasons there are. Her concern is not with a bare property but with the normative force that property signals. Unlike the fetishist, she stands ready to abandon any act once she learns it is not required. That flexibility is incompatible with fetishistic fixation.\n\nObjection 3: De dicto action is heteronomous\u2014one\u2019s will is dictated by an external code rather than one\u2019s own evaluative outlook.  \nReply: When the agent endorses the moral law as authoritative for her deliberation, the law is no longer external. It is integrated into her practical identity; she governs herself by reasons that she, upon reflection, recognises as decisive. Autonomy is preserved.\n\n5. Why De Dicto Motivation Is (Often) More, Not Less, Praiseworthy\n\nSuppose two drivers notice a child who has fallen in traffic. Alice swerves because the child\u2019s distress horrifies her; Ben swerves because \u201csaving the child is morally required.\u201d Both succeed. Which is more praiseworthy?\n\nFactors relevant to praise:\n\n(a) Effort and cost. If Ben overrides strong self-regarding incentives (he risks injury) solely because of duty, the exertion of will displays greater commitment than Alice\u2019s spontaneous empathic reaction.\n\n(b) Scope of concern. Alice might respond similarly only to children whose vulnerability triggers her affection mechanisms. Ben is disposed to save any endangered person, including those who elicit no sympathy. That broader scope constitutes a deeper recognition of impartial moral reasons.\n\n(c) Stability across contexts. Empathy is notoriously susceptible to distance, statistical abstraction, and prejudice; a duty-motive is not.\n\nThese considerations show that de dicto motivation is not the poor cousin of concrete concern. Depending on circumstances, it may reveal a morally superior responsiveness.\n\n6. Two Clarifying Examples\n\nExample 1: The Decisive Judge  \nA judge must impose a sentence on an affable but corrupt official. The official\u2019s charm naturally engenders sympathy. The judge sets aside these feelings and sentences strictly according to the law because \u201cjustice requires it.\u201d We do not brand the judge a fetishist. Her abstract thought that \u201cthis is what justice demands\u201d secures impartiality\u2014exactly what we want from an upright judiciary.\n\nExample 2: The Exhausted Parent  \nA parent caring for a colicky infant at 3 a.m. may feel no warmth, only bone-deep weariness. Yet she gets up \u201cbecause it is my duty as a parent.\u201d Her motive is de dicto, but we would scarcely deny her praise. Indeed we often think such late-night ministrations are worthier than the daytime play that flows effortlessly from affection; perseverance in duty amidst depleted emotion reveals steadfast love through another channel.\n\nBoth examples undercut the empirical claim that de dicto motivation alienates the agent from concrete values. The judge cares about justice; the parent cares about the child. Their route to action travels through duty because alternative motivational paths are blocked or morally risky.\n\n7. Limits and Residual Questions\n\nI have argued that the duty motive can suffice for moral worth, but two limits merit notice.\n\nLimit 1: Content ignorance. If the agent\u2019s de dicto desire does not pass through an accurate representation of right-making features\u2014say she uncritically obeys a moral authority figure\u2014then praise is attenuated. Acting \u201cbecause it is right\u201d when one\u2019s belief about rightness is the product of bias or dogma does not manifest the rational excellence I defended. The epistemic component matters.\n\nLimit 2: Crowding-out. There is empirical evidence (e.g., in crowding-out studies on charitable giving) that emphasising duty sometimes dampens spontaneous concern. If de dicto emphasis systematically eclipses morally healthy sentiments, the agent\u2019s character may be lopsided. While isolated dutiful acts can suffice for moral worth, a wholly sentiment-less life would fall short of the human good. Still, that is a structural, not an occasion-specific, criticism.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe fetishism charge rests on a misunderstanding of how abstract moral commitment operates within practical agency. A de dicto desire to do what is morally right can supply all that is needed for moral worth, provided it is (i) the operative motive, (ii) guided by an informed appreciation of the right-making features, and (iii) expressive of rational recognition of morality\u2019s authority. In many real-world cases duty not only suffices but excels, securing impartiality, reliability, and steadfastness where more sentimental motives falter. Moral philosophy should therefore resist any simple preference for concrete over abstract motives and instead appraise how agents integrate the two within the architecture of their deliberative lives.", "output_tokens": 2754, "reasoning_tokens": 512}

Introduction and Thesis\n\nCan a person who cares only about \u201cdoing the right thing\u201d act with full moral worth, even when no more concrete sentiment\u2014compassion, friendship, love of beauty\u2014animates her? Common\u2010sense moral psychology says no: someone who pulls a child from a raging river because \u201cthat is what morality requires,\u201d without an ounce of fellow\u2010feeling, strikes us as cold, even repellent. Philosophers have echoed this reaction. Michael Stocker worries that obsession with \u201cright\u2010making features\u201d breeds moral schizophrenia; Berys Gaut calls it \u201cmoral fetishism;\u201d Susan Wolf remarks that the \u201cmoral saint\u201d seems deeply alienated from what actually makes life valuable. The shared suggestion is that a purely de dicto desire to do what is right\u200b\u2014\u200ba desire aimed at the property of rightness as such\u200b\u2014\u200bcannot confer genuine praiseworthiness.\n\nMy thesis cuts against this consensus: acting solely from the motive of duty can suffice for moral worth, and, under certain recognizable conditions, can be morally exemplary. The core of the case is that the de dicto desire to do what is right, far from being an empty abstraction, can itself be a substantive expression of respect for persons and of one\u2019s own practical agency. When sincerely held, it manifests an appreciation of others as bearers of moral claims and of oneself as answerable to those claims. This \u201crespectful agency\u201d is valuable in its own right. Moreover, a purely dutiful motive need not exhibit the psychological defects critics allege; alienation and fetishism arise only when the motive of duty is malformed, not when it is operating properly. Finally, a commitment to rightness plays an indispensable architectonic role: it integrates and adjudicates competing concrete values, providing a stable and impartial standpoint that nothing else can fully supply. These points together show that the motive of duty can, without supplementation, ground praiseworthy action.\n\nThe argument proceeds in four stages. Section 2 clarifies the central concepts: de dicto vs. de re moral desire, moral worth, and praiseworthiness. Section 3 rebuts three leading objections\u200b\u2014\u200bthe fetishism charge, the alienation worry, and the \u201cmissing value\u201d objection\u200b\u2014\u200bshowing that each either misdiagnoses the motivational structure of dutiful action or demands more than moral worth requires. Section 4 presents a positive account: a dutiful action has moral worth when it (i) is guided by a reliable capacity to discern rightness, (ii) springs from a standing commitment to treat persons with respect, and (iii) expresses autonomous authorship of one\u2019s choices. Section 5 illustrates the view with concrete cases and highlights its explanatory advantages. Section 6 concludes by situating the account within broader debates between Kantian and virtue-ethical approaches.\n\n2. Clarifying the Terrain\n\n2.1 De dicto vs. de re moral motivation  \nA de dicto moral desire is directed at an act under the description \u201can action that is morally right.\u201d It is structurally second-order: the agent wants, of her available options, whichever one is right. By contrast, de re moral motivation tracks the particular features that make an action right (its promoting wellbeing, keeping a promise, etc.) without invoking the abstract property of rightness. The same action can of course be motivated both de dicto and de re; the present question isolates the first component.\n\n2.2 Moral worth and praiseworthiness  \nKant draws a celebrated distinction between doing what is right and doing it \u201cfrom duty.\u201d Only the latter possesses moral worth and calls for esteem. Contemporary discourse often replaces \u201cmoral worth\u201d with \u201cpraiseworthiness,\u201d but retains the core idea: an action is praiseworthy insofar as it manifests the agent\u2019s morally excellent dispositions. I shall follow this usage: to say that a motive suffices for moral worth is to say that when an agent acts from that motive (and the action is in fact right), she merits moral praise.\n\n3. Three Objections Reassessed\n\n3.1 The fetishism charge (Michael Smith, Berys Gaut)  \nA fetishist, famously, is invested in an object because of one of its properties while ignoring its substantive features. Analogously, the de dicto moral agent is said to fetishize the property \u201crightness,\u201d treating it as an \u201coccult property stamped on actions,\u201d divorced from the concrete values ethics is about. Two replies undermine this parallel.\n\nFirst, the fetishism analogy overlooks the epistemic structure of moral deliberation. Except in toy cases, agents are uncertain about which particular consideration\u2014welfare, fairness, promise-keeping\u2014ultimately justifies a given act. A standing desire to do what is right functions as an epistemic heuristic: it directs practical attention toward whichever reasons, once fully assessed, turn out to be decisive. That is not fetishistic; it is a rational strategy for dealing with uncertainty.\n\nSecond, the fetishism worry presupposes that the de dicto desire crowds out other motivations. But the claim under dispute is only that the de dicto motive can be sufficient, not that it must be the only motive. Even when it is the sole conscious motive, an agent\u2019s cognitive access to rightness requires that she understand at least some concrete moral reasons. Otherwise she could not identify an action as right in the first place. The abstract desire is thus necessarily connected to substantive value, undermining the fetishism comparison.\n\n3.2 The alienation worry (Stocker, Wolf)  \nOn this view, a person moved solely by duty is estranged from personal projects and affections that give human life its texture; she is \u201ctoo morally buttoned-up\u201d to be an attractive character. Two points blunt the force of this critique.\n\nAlienation from value vs. alienation from the agent. What Wolf and Stocker document are cases where dutiful motivation alienates the agent from her own desires (she helps a friend because it is right, not because she cares). That may indeed make the agent less lovable, but it does not show that her action lacks moral worth. The question before us is narrower: are we entitled to praise her morally? The fact that she sets aside her private attachments for the sake of duty can itself ground moral admiration, even if it limits her personal flourishing.\n\nSecond, the charge presupposes that a robust moral life and rich personal attachments cannot coexist. But history brims with counterexamples: consider the abolitionists who, moved by the moral law alone, repudiated prevailing sentiments. Their lives were not emotionally impoverished; rather, their de dicto commitment to rightness structured and deepened their other attachments by preventing complicity in injustice. Alienation is not a necessary consequence of dutiful motivation; it is, at most, a contingent possibility.\n\n3.3 The missing-value objection  \nA final critique says that an act motivated only by respect for rightness fails to register what is actually valuable in the world. The rescuer who saves a child \u201cbecause it is right\u201d supposedly misses the point: the child\u2019s life is what matters, not the abstract property of rightness. This objection conflates motivational focus with evaluative recognition. To intend to do what is right just is to intend an action whose right-making features one believes to obtain. One cannot form the de dicto intention without also representing those features. The difference is merely which representation moves the will. The rescuer need not be oblivious to the child\u2019s life; she simply channels her motivational energy through the practical judgment that saving the child is morally required. No evaluative blindness ensues.\n\n4. A Positive Account: Respectful Agency\n\nHaving cleared the ground, we can state a sufficiency thesis:\n\nA right action performed solely from the motive of duty possesses moral worth when the agent\u2019s de dicto desire embodies (i) reliability in tracking rightness, (ii) respect for persons as ends, and (iii) autonomous authorship.\n\n4.1 Reliability condition  \nMoral worth presupposes that the agent is not merely lucky. Her de dicto desire must be guided by a reliable cognitive capacity\u2014practical wisdom, conscience, or reflective equilibrium\u2014that tends to identify right action in varied circumstances. Without this, the action is akin to a fortunate accident; praise attaches to competence, not chance.\n\n4.2 Respect condition  \nWhy is the abstract concern with rightness valuable? Because the property \u201cbeing morally right\u201d is not a metaphysical curiosity but the normative shadow of a deeper moral reality: the status of persons as bearers of claims. A desire to act rightly is, when properly formed, a desire to stand in the relations of respect that persons are owed. Kant called this the \u201crecognition of the authority of the moral law.\u201d Such recognition is itself a mode of valuing persons, one uniquely suited to pluralistic contexts where we cannot always be moved by affection or fellow-feeling. The dutiful motive therefore instantiates moral value rather than bypassing it.\n\n4.3 Autonomy condition  \nFinally, moral worth attaches to actions that agents author. A purely instinctive impulse, or an act performed under hypnosis, though causally connected to rightness, would not be praiseworthy. The de dicto desire to obey morality is paradigmatically an exercise of self-legislation: the agent treats the moral standard as one she endorses, not merely as an external pressure. Praiseworthiness attaches to this self-governing stance.\n\nNotice that these conditions do not smuggle concrete motives back in. The agent could entirely lack sympathetic feelings or personal attachments; as long as she meets reliability, respect, and autonomy, her action earns moral praise. Yet the account also explains why many purely dutiful agents will in fact cultivate emotions like sympathy: these feelings assist reliability and deepen their grasp of respect. The view thus harmonizes with common intuition while affirming the sufficiency of duty.\n\n5. Illustrative Cases\n\n5.1 The Flooded Hospital  \nDr. Hayes must decide whether to stay at her flooded hospital to care for patients or flee to ensure her own safety. Exhausted and numb, she feels no compassion; what moves her is the firm judgment, \u201cIt would be wrong to abandon them.\u201d She stays. Dr. Hayes satisfies all three conditions. Her medical training and moral reflection supply reliability; her choice stems from respect for vulnerable persons; and she acts autonomously, having considered alternatives. Intuition says her conduct is praiseworthy despite the absence of warm feelings. The sufficiency thesis captures this.\n\n5.2 The Chilly Bystander  \nSam, walking by a pond, sees a child drowning. He feels no empathy but recalls that morality requires one to rescue at small cost. He wades in and saves the child. Critics might deride Sam as cold, yet most of us would still praise him\u2014certainly more than the onlooker who walks by for fear of muddy shoes. What matters morally is that Sam responded to the child\u2019s claim on him, albeit under the description \u201cmorally required.\u201d Again, sufficiency holds.\n\n5.3 The Bigoted Reformer  \nConsider instead Clara, raised with racist attitudes. She endorses the maxim \u201calways do what is right,\u201d but her empirical beliefs are corrupt: she mistakenly judges segregation right. She campaigns to maintain Jim Crow. Clara fails the reliability condition; hence her dutiful motive confers no moral worth. The view explains why de dicto desire is not automatically praiseworthy\u2014properly functioning moral cognition is essential.\n\n6. Positioning the View\n\n6.1 Relation to virtue ethics  \nVirtue ethicists insist that acting rightly requires being motivated by the right reasons in the right way. I agree\u2014my autonomy and respect conditions echo this. Where we differ is over whether concrete affective motives are necessary. The sufficiency thesis says no: what counts is the quality of practical judgment and the stance of respect, not the phenomenology of compassion. Virtue ethics is right to valorize traits like generosity; it errs in treating them as the only route to moral worth.\n\n6.2 Kantian lineage  \nThe account draws openly on Kant\u2019s notion of respect for the moral law, but it revises Kant in two ways. First, it refrains from marginalizing empirical feelings; they can play a constructive role in reliability. Second, it treats the duty motive as one valuable form of moral motivation among several, rather than the sole locus of worth. Still, the Kantian thesis that respect for law can alone ground moral worth is vindicated.\n\n6.3 Practical implications  \nRecognizing the sufficiency of duty has social importance. In institutional contexts\u2014judges, police, civil servants\u2014we often need agents to act on principle precisely when sympathy is unreliable or dangerous. A culture that disparages the motive of duty risks undermining these roles. Conversely, acknowledging the moral worth of principle fortifies integrity in complex pluralistic societies.\n\n7. Conclusion\n\nThe debate over duty\u2019s sufficiency is, at bottom, a debate about what we honor in moral agency. Critics focus on the warmth of the agent\u2019s heart; defenders of duty emphasize the clarity of her conscience. I have argued that the latter orientation is enough for moral praise, provided it is competently and autonomously exercised in a spirit of respect. The de dicto desire to do what is morally right is neither fetishistic nor alienating when properly formed; it is a distinctive expression of the value that persons, including oneself, matter. An agent who acts from this motive shows herself answerable to the moral community and worthy of our esteem.", "output_tokens": 3222, "reasoning_tokens": 384}

Introduction: The Charge of \u201cMoral Fetishism\u201d  \nThe thought that moral worth requires more than a bare concern to \u201cdo the right thing\u201d is intuitive and widespread. We admire the Samaritan who helps because the injured stranger is in pain, not\u2014so the worry goes\u2014because she is checking off a box labelled Right Action.  Philosophers (Williams, Stocker, Smith, Arpaly, Markovits, and others) have developed this worry into the charge of moral fetishism: the dutiful agent is fixated on an abstract property (rightness) and thereby estranges herself from the concrete values that make actions right.  But is that charge inevitably correct?  Must an agent motivated only by a de dicto desire to do what is morally right lack the moral worth we praise?  \n\nI shall defend three claims:\n\n1. A de dicto desire to do what is morally right can be sufficient for moral worth, provided it is suitably integrated into the agent\u2019s overall motivational psychology.  \n2. What makes such action praiseworthy is not the presence of any particular first-order, de re concern (for pain relief, flourishing, justice, etc.) but the quality of the agent\u2019s will\u2014specifically, her reliable responsiveness to the reasons that morally matter.  \n3. The fetishism worry conflates two importantly different phenomena: (a) motivational structure (whether the agent\u2019s highest-order desire is de dicto or de re) and (b) deliberative competence (whether the agent can recognize and appropriately respond to right-making features).  When these are separated, we see that the alienation critique targets only certain deficient versions of de dicto motivation, not the form itself.\n\nIf this argument succeeds, then acting solely from duty can be fully morally worthy, though\u2014as I concede at the end\u2014there may be dimensions of admiration (e.g., warmth, grace) that distinguish the person who helps from affection from the person who helps from principle.\n\n2. Setting the Table: Distinctions We Need  \n\nDistinction 1: De dicto vs. de re moral motivation  \n\u2022 De re (of the thing) concern: a desire directed at the concrete right-making factor itself\u2014e.g., \u201cI want to alleviate that child\u2019s suffering.\u201d  \n\u2022 De dicto (of the description) concern: \u201cI want, whatever it is, to do what is morally right.\u201d  \n\nDistinction 2: Occurrent vs. standing motive  \nOne might have a standing de dicto commitment while deliberating occurrently about the child\u2019s pain.  The fetishism charge typically targets the case where the de dicto desire is the sole occurrent motive.  \n\nDistinction 3: Guidance vs. production  \nA desire can guide deliberation (set the standard) even if it is not what moves the body to act; conversely, it can produce action without sophisticated guidance.  Confusing these roles makes the fetish charge look stronger than it is.  \n\nDistinction 4: Worth vs. optimal worth  \nAn action can meet a threshold of praiseworthiness without incarnating the most admirable motive possible.  The fetishist objector often slides from \u201cnot optimally virtuous\u201d to \u201cnot morally worthy at all.\u201d  \n\nWith these distinctions in hand, the dialectic can proceed more cleanly.\n\n3. A Kantian Point Rehabilitated  \nKant famously argued that only actions done from duty have moral worth.  Many find the view extreme, but its core insight remains potent: moral worth tracks the agent\u2019s recognition of obligating reasons and her reliable commitment to act on them.  Kant\u2019s own account is richer than the familiar caricature.  He denies neither sympathy nor love any value; he only insists that their moral worth is contingent unless undergirded by the regulative idea of duty.  If my kindness evaporates when I am in a foul mood, the underlying good will is revealed to be fragile.  A de dicto commitment to do right, by contrast, is structurally aimed at stability and impartiality; it aspires to act \u201cfrom the moral law.\u201d\n\nNotice how this line of thought already loosens the fetishism charge: the de dicto desire is not fixating on an empty property but on a norm that bundles together, in one place, all the concrete considerations that make acts right.  Saying \u201cI want to do what morality demands\u201d is (if morality is correctly understood) tantamount to saying \u201cI want to respond appropriately to suffering, flourishing, autonomy, fairness, promise-keeping, etc., in whatever proportion they merit.\u201d  The abstract label can function as a compressed representation of those concrete reasons, not a mysterious substitute for them.\n\nAn analogy: a conscientious physician might declare, \u201cMy professional aim is to promote the patient\u2019s health.\u201d  Is she thereby fetishising \u201chealth\u201d as an abstract property?  That seems an odd complaint.  The general aim is what enables her to navigate an indefinite variety of particular symptoms, treatments, and trade-offs.  Likewise, \u201cdo what is right\u201d can be a regulative commitment that efficiently encodes diverse moral data.\n\n4. The Reliability Argument  \nThe first positive argument that a purely de dicto motive can suffice for moral worth is reliability under epistemic, motivational, and situational strain.\n\n(A) Epistemic strain.  Some right-making features are invisible to untutored perception.  Exploitative labor practices in a distant supply chain, for instance, are not salient to my empathic concern the way a bleeding pedestrian is.  A standing commitment to do what is right motivates investigation: \u201cIs buying this shirt permissible?\u201d  The de dicto desire reaches outward for relevant facts even when no de re affect is triggered.\n\n(B) Motivational strain.  My sympathies are subject to bias\u2014toward the near, the similar, the cute.  The de dicto desire is by definition impartial.  It prompts me to override partiality where required.  Consider Milgram\u2019s experiment: someone who refused to shock only because \u201cthis seems morally wrong\u201d exemplified justified de dicto motivation even in the teeth of experimenter pressure.\n\n(C) Situational strain.  When fatigued, anxious, or angered, our de re concerns wax and wane.  A higher-order de dicto commitment can supply resolve: I may not feel like paying the onerous tax bill, yet I do so because it is the right thing.  The resulting honesty is morally worthy even if no warm empathy motivates compliance.\n\nReliability is morally relevant because morality itself is demanding across contexts; a motive that tracks right-making considerations stably is therefore a legitimate basis for praise.\n\n5. Objection 1: Understanding and Alienation  \nCritics emphasize a worry about understanding: \u201cIf you rescue me solely \u2018because it\u2019s right,\u2019 you don\u2019t really grasp\u2014or care about\u2014my suffering; you treat me as an occasion for the exercise of moral purity.\u201d  The reply invokes Distinctions 1 and 3.  To deliberate under the description \u201cmorally required\u201d one must (if competent) understand at least the gist of why it is required.  In normal agents, the de dicto desire is not satisfied by zombie compliance; it is satisfied only by seeing that the action is right, which involves some recognition of relevant concrete features.  Just as a chess player who aims to make \u201cthe best move in the position\u201d must appreciate, at least minimally, the threats and resources on the board, a morally dutiful agent must appreciate that you are in distress.\n\nMoreover, accusations of alienation overlook the second-personal dimension of moral address.  If you ask, \u201cWhy did you help me?\u201d and I say, \u201cBecause alleviating your suffering mattered,\u201d that answer is intelligible.  But another fully intelligible answer is, \u201cBecause it would have been wrong not to.\u201d  Indeed, that reply signals regard: it treats you as a bearer of moral claims that obligate me.  Conforming to duty is a way of taking the other\u2019s standpoint seriously (to borrow Darwall\u2019s phrasing).\n\n6. Objection 2: Motivational Richness  \nThe critic may accept sufficiency but downgrade the value: \u201cYes, dutiful action has some worth, but it is less worthy than action from love or compassion.\u201d  Two points:\n\nFirst, there are contexts where de dicto duty is not merely second-best but superior.  Suppose a judge must sentence a defendant who elicits her sympathy.  The right sentence may be severe.  If the judge\u2019s compassion sways her from the legally and morally correct outcome, her action lacks worth; if her impartial de dicto commitment to justice secures the appropriate sentence, that commitment is not a consolation prize.\n\nSecond, degrees of worth can co-exist in a pluralistic landscape.  A doctor moved by both duty and compassion might display the highest worth; a doctor moved solely by duty still merits praise; a doctor moved only by profit merits none.  The key claim defended here is sufficiency for genuine moral worth, not for maximal worth.\n\n7. Objection 3: De dicto Motivation and Moral Epistemic Luck  \nWhat if the agent\u2019s conception of \u201cmorally right\u201d is substantively mistaken yet she acts from duty?  A fanatical inquisitor burns heretics \u201cbecause it is right.\u201d  Surely that is not praiseworthy.  True.  But the problem is not that the motive is de dicto; it is that the agent\u2019s moral epistemology is gravely defective.  Any account of moral worth must include a correctness or tracking condition: the agent\u2019s motive must be appropriately connected to the actual right-making reasons.  Add that condition and the inquisitor case is dispatched.  Notice that the same issue arises for de re motives: someone might save a drowning dog out of love for canines while ignoring the drowning human beside it; we would withhold praise there, too, because the response fails to track morally decisive reasons.\n\n8. A Neo-Kantian Synthesis: Quality of Will and Competence  \nWe are now positioned to articulate a general account.\n\nDefinition (Good Will Condition): An action has moral worth iff it issues from a will that (i) is stably disposed to act in conformity with moral reasons and (ii) does so because those reasons have normative authority for the agent.  \n\nDefinition (Competence Condition): A will is disposed as in (i) only if the agent exercises sufficient moral competence\u2014sensitivity to, and grasp of, the considerations that in fact make actions right.  \n\nOn this model a purely de dicto desire satisfies (i) as long as, in tandem with the agent\u2019s cognition, it tracks right-making features; it satisfies (ii) because the agent acts under the authority of morality.  No de re motive is required.  The model also explains why fetishistic caricatures fail: a \u201cmoral fetishist\u201d who robotically recites \u201cdo right\u201d yet cannot identify what rightness demands would flunk the competence condition.\n\n9. A Concrete Case Study  \nLaura faces a choice: return an erroneously received tax refund of $8,000 or keep the windfall.  No identifiable individual will be visibly hurt; the money would be absorbed into the Treasury.  Laura feels no sympathetic pangs\u2014no child is weeping in front of her\u2014but she does have a firm resolve to do what is right.  She deliberates, recalls that keeping money you are not entitled to is dishonest, that a fair tax system relies on truthfulness, and that her society\u2019s public goods are at stake.  She returns the money.\n\nIs Laura\u2019s act morally worthy?  If one insists that only compassion or some other concrete affect confers worth, the answer must be no.  That seems implausible.  We would justly praise her integrity, especially given the temptation and anonymity.  What grounds our praise is precisely that she recognized moral reasons and acted from them.  The case shows how de dicto motivation can be laudable even when de re emotions are inert.\n\n10. Why the Fetishism Worry Persists  \nPart of what fuels the worry is an aesthetic preference: we like warmth, immediacy, the human touch.  A merely dutiful act can feel cold.  But moral worth and likability are distinct.  Stocker\u2019s hospital visitor, who visits a friend solely from duty, may be less endearing than the visitor moved by love, yet her fidelity remains praiseworthy.  The aesthetic datum therefore does not underwrite the normative conclusion that de dicto motivation is insufficient for worth.\n\nAnother source of unease is a metaphysical vision of moral agency as rooted in sentiment (Humean tradition).  If reasons are motivationally inert absent desire, the de dicto motive can seem mysteriously self-propelling.  But on any plausible psychology, de dicto motives are desires too\u2014albeit higher-order normative desires.  Modern empirical work on \u201cprincipled\u201d or \u201crule-based\u201d moral motivation lends support: individuals scoring highly on principled moral identity measures display stable, cross-situational moral behaviour even when emotion is muted.\n\n11. What About Virtue Ethics?  \nVirtue ethicists prize finely-tuned concern for the concrete particulars.  Does the foregoing sideline the virtues?  Not necessarily.  We can treat the virtues as the traits that enable competent tracking of reasons.  Courage, compassion, and generosity provide epistemic and motivational sensitivity to right-making features; the de dicto commitment provides integrative governance.  The best moral psychology has both elements.  What I resist is the leap from \u201cvirtues add value\u201d to \u201cdutiful resolve alone never suffices.\u201d\n\n12. Degrees of Worth and the Plurality of Praise  \nWhile sufficiency is my main thesis, a full moral phenomenology admits that some dutiful actions shine brighter than others.  Three scaling variables are salient:\n\n(1) Epistemic depth: how fully the agent grasps the concrete reasons.  \n(2) Motivational harmony: whether the de dicto motive conflicts with or is supported by de re motives.  \n(3) Costliness: the sacrifice endured.  \n\nLaura\u2019s tax honesty scores high on (3), moderate on (2), moderate on (1); it is clearly praiseworthy.  A second agent, Sabrina, who loves public goods and feels vivid concern for fairness, would score even higher on (2) and (1).  There is room for gradation without denying Laura\u2019s worth.\n\n13. Conclusion  \nActing solely from a desire to do what is morally right can suffice for moral worth.  The key is the integration of that de dicto desire within a competent, reason-responsive will.  The fetishism worry recedes once we distinguish motivational structure from deliberative competence: fetishism is a pathology of incompetence, not an inevitable feature of de dicto motivation.  A purely dutiful agent may lack certain graces of sentiment, but she possesses the central virtue of integrity\u2014steadfast responsiveness to moral reasons\u2014and that is enough to deserve praise.", "output_tokens": 3798, "reasoning_tokens": 640}

Introduction and Thesis\n\nIs an agent who saves a drowning child \u201cjust because it is the morally right thing to do,\u201d yet who feels no particular warmth toward the child, worthy of praise? A broad tradition stretching from Aristotle to Michael Stocker and Susan Wolf says no. Such a rescuer, we are told, is a moral fetishist: she fixates on the abstract property of rightness while remaining alienated from the very features that make the act right (the child\u2019s terror, the value of her life). I will argue that this verdict is too quick. A de dicto motive\u2014\u201cto do what is morally right\u201d\u2014can by itself be sufficient for moral worth, provided it is suitably integrated into the agent\u2019s practical psychology. What makes such austere dutiful action praiseworthy is (i) the way it embodies a distinctively rational form of responsiveness to moral reasons, (ii) the way it secures impartial reliability across contexts, and (iii) the respect it pays to the moral law and, derivatively, to persons as bearers of that law. Although a purely dutiful agent may lack certain attractive traits (e.g., spontaneous sympathy), her actions are still worthy of moral admiration because they manifest self-governance under the authority of morality itself. In defending this thesis, I will (A) clarify the relevant motivational distinctions, (B) diagnose the standard \u201cfetishism\u201d objection, (C) show how a de dicto motive can nevertheless track the concrete right-making features, and (D) explain what kind of praise is appropriate.\n\n2. Clarifying De dicto and De re Moral Motivation\n\nFollowing Mark Schroeder, call a de re desire one that targets a specific property or object: \u201cI want to relieve that child\u2019s suffering.\u201d A de dicto desire is more abstract: \u201cI want to do what morality requires.\u201d Two errors must be avoided. First, a de dicto desire is not necessarily content-less; it has the content of moral requirement, even if the agent cannot yet specify which act that is. Second, \u201csolely motivated by duty\u201d can mean either that the de dicto desire is the agent\u2019s only first-order desire relevant to the act or that it is the decisive desire at the moment of action. For concreteness, assume the strongest version: the agent\u2019s *only* relevant motivational state is the abstract desire to comply with moral duty.\n\nA further distinction: we can assess (i) the *moral worth* of the action (roughly Kant\u2019s Frage: does it express good will?) and (ii) the *attractiveness* of the agent\u2019s character (would we like such a person as a friend?). The fetishism objection typically conflates these dimensions. I will concede that a merely dutiful agent may be less lovable than a compassionate one, yet maintain that her actions are fully morally worthy in Kant\u2019s sense.\n\n3. The Standard Objection: Moral Fetishism and Alienation\n\n3.1 Stocker\u2019s Schizophrenic Pleasures.   Stocker portrays a friend who visits you in the hospital \u201cfor duty\u2019s sake\u201d alone; you feel disappointed, as though she cared not for *you* but for an abstraction. The moral seems to be that friendship demands de re motives.\n\n3.2 Wolf\u2019s Moral Saints.   Wolf argues that agents whose every choice is driven by moral duty lack the variety of interests and affections constitutive of a rich human life; they are in that sense unattractive ideals.\n\n3.3 Smith\u2019s Fetishism charge.   Michael Smith worries that an agent motivated only by the de dicto desire to do right lacks sensitivity to the reasons that make something right; her motive is, as it were, pointed in the wrong direction.\n\nUnderlying all three is a transition from: \u201cThe agent\u2019s motive is purely de dicto\u201d to \u201cThe agent is insensitive to the right-making reasons,\u201d and from there to \u201cThe action lacks moral worth.\u201d The two transitions are not mandatory; the middle premise can be denied.\n\n4. Why De dicto Motivation Need Not Be Insensitive\n\nImagine Anna, who faces three options: rescue the child (R), scroll her phone (P), or taunt the child (T). Anna possesses a single desire: to do what morality requires. She investigates which act is morally required, concludes it is R, and acts accordingly. Does Anna care about the child\u2019s welfare? At the level of first-order desires, no. But at the level of *reasons-responsiveness* she is perfectly keyed to them: had she discovered that relieving the child\u2019s terror *wasn\u2019t* morally required (say, because someone else was already rescuing the child and interfering would worsen matters), she would not have leapt in.\n\nConsider a thermostat. It has a higher-order aim: keep the room at 20 \u00b0C. It does not \u201ccare\u201d about the specific chemical processes by which the heater reaches that temperature; nonetheless, it is exquisitely sensitive to them. Likewise, an agent whose highest-order desire is \u201ccomply with moral reasons\u201d can track all the fine-grained right-making features via her *beliefs*. The de dicto desire supplies the motivational force; the beliefs supply the informational content. Together they solve the practical problem.\n\nThe fetishism charge presupposes that genuine sensitivity must be encoded in desire rather than belief. But that is a gratuitous restriction. We routinely explain action as the product of a general desire plus a context-specific belief: \u201cHe wants to stay healthy and therefore takes vitamin C because he believes it promotes immunity.\u201d Why should morality be special?\n\n5. The Positive Case for Praiseworthiness\n\n5.1 Autonomy under Moral Law.   Kant\u2019s central insight is that moral worth attaches to acts done from reverence for the law. What impresses us in Anna is her capacity to guide herself by a principle she recognizes as having unconditional authority. This is a triumph of *practical reason*: she does not merely happen to act rightly; she *makes it* the ground of her action. The kind of praise appropriate here is not warmth but esteem: respect for her self-legislation.\n\n5.2 Reliability and Impartiality.   Concrete motives such as sympathy, though charming, are notoriously selective: we feel them more toward the near, the similar, the photogenic. A de dicto motive is impartial by construction; it commits the agent to *whoever* happens to need help, whether or not the situation tugs at her heartstrings. That reliability is itself a praiseworthy moral asset. If we imagine an \u201cice-hearted\u201d but purely dutiful lifeguard, we may prefer him on a bad day to a warm-hearted but distractible one.\n\n5.3 Respect for Persons as Ends.   Far from alienating the agent from concrete value, the de dicto motive can *express* respect for it. To treat the child\u2019s welfare as a *moral requirement* is to take her interests with ultimate seriousness, elevating them to a categorical imperative. In Kantian language, the child\u2019s rational nature legislates a claim on my will; acting from duty acknowledges that claim precisely as such. The alternative\u2014acting merely from inclination\u2014risks treating the child as an object of sentimental preference rather than as a rightful claimant.\n\n6. Replies to Leading Objections\n\nObjection 1: The Dutiful Agent Is Cold and Therefore Unlovely  \nReply: Lovability and moral worth are separate axes. We rightly cherish benevolent dispositions, but the question at hand is whether an action can *merit moral praise*. Even Hume distinguishes between the *agreeable* and the *virtuous*. The stoic who suppresses feelings but acts from reason may be less agreeable, yet virtuous nonetheless.\n\nObjection 2: The Agent Would Act Well Only If Convinced It Is Morally Required; This Shows a Lack of Direct Concern  \nReply: True, but that conditionality is exactly what rational agency demands. We want agents whose actions vary with reasons, not with the ebb and flow of sentiment. The worry confuses motivational *structure* with motivational *content*. That my desire is \u201cact as required\u201d does not show indifference to persons; it shows reverence for the norm that protects them.\n\nObjection 3: The Dutiful Agent Misses Something Ethically Important\u2014E.g., the Virtue of Compassion  \nReply: I happily concede she lacks some virtues. Moral worth is not an all-or-nothing trophy; different traits warrant different kinds of praise. Pure duty secures the virtue of justice; compassion secures the virtue of benevolence. An agent can possess one without the other. The question was sufficiency, not exhaustiveness.\n\nObjection 4: If Everyone Were Purely Dutiful, Human Life Would Be Bleak  \nReply: Perhaps, but that is a sociological worry. The claim that a motive suffices for moral worth does not imply it is optimal for human flourishing. Stoic sages might be rare but still exemplify a form of moral excellence.\n\n7. A Refined Hybrid View?\n\nOne might grant my arguments yet insist that the *best* motivational profile integrates both de dicto and de re elements. I agree. There is no conflict in practice: the dutiful agent can cultivate sympathetic feelings as auxiliary motives. Kant himself encourages promoting helpful inclinations because they facilitate duty. But acknowledging the value of such hybridity is consistent with maintaining that duty alone crosses the threshold of moral worth.\n\n8. An Illustrative Triad\n\nConsider three rescuers:\n\nBen: Acts from spontaneous empathy for the child.  \nCarol: Acts from mixed motives: empathy plus a sense of duty.  \nDana: Feels nothing particular but acts solely from the conviction that rescue is morally required.\n\nHow should we rank them?\n\nSympathy: Ben = Carol > Dana  \nReliability across impartial cases: Dana = Carol > Ben  \nMoral worth (as responsiveness to the authority of morality): Carol = Dana > Ben\n\nThus Dana ties for first in the dimension that Kant\u2014and the present question\u2014focuses on, even though she performs worse on other admirable dimensions. This suggests that the fetishism objection stems from importing extra criteria (friendliness, warmth) into the assessment of *moral* worth.\n\n9. Why the Fetishism Label Misfires\n\nA fetish involves fixating on a property divorced from its normal context (e.g., a shoe independent of the person). But morality as such is not an accidental property; it *just is* the totality of right-making features, summarised under the normative concept \u201cwhat ought to be done.\u201d To desire to do the right thing is to orient one\u2019s will toward *whatever* set of features turns out to have that property. Far from being an alien abstraction, \u201cmoral rightness\u201d is a meta-level pointer that tracks the concrete values in a systematic way.\n\n10. The Role of Moral Epistemology\n\nA worry persists: what if the agent misidentifies the right action? Would her de dicto motive still confer worth? I follow Kant\u2019s dictum that moral worth requires acting \u201cfor the sake of duty\u201d *and* in a way that accords with duty. Thus mistaken duty (e.g., the well-meaning inquisitor) lacks worth not because the motive is de dicto but because the deed is wrong. Moral worth demands success under the aspect of duty plus the right kind of motive. That further underscores the importance of linking the de dicto desire with rational deliberation and evidence.\n\n11. Comparative Cases: Epistemic and Aesthetic Duty\n\nOur intuitions in non-moral domains support my view. A scientist who pursues truth *because it is true* rather than out of personal curiosity is praiseworthy. An art critic who judges paintings by the *standards of artistic excellence*, indifferent to personal taste, earns esteem. In neither case do we accuse the agent of \u201cepistemic fetishism\u201d or \u201caesthetic alienation.\u201d We praise their principled commitment. Morality should be no different.\n\n12. Conclusion\n\nActing solely from the desire to do what is morally right can indeed suffice for morally worthy conduct. The charge of fetishism misconstrues the relation between higher-order motives and first-order reasons. When properly understood, a de dicto motive is a rational device that (i) integrates all concrete right-making reasons under a unifying norm, (ii) secures impartial reliability, and (iii) expresses respect for the moral law and, thereby, for persons. Such dutiful action merits praise even if it lacks the warmth of fellow-feeling or the charm of partial affection. In the economy of moral evaluation, duty has its own noble currency, and it spends just fine.", "output_tokens": 3224, "reasoning_tokens": 512}

Introduction and Thesis\n\nIs an agent who acts solely from a de-dicto desire to \u201cdo the right thing\u201d\u2014rather than from the more concrete motives that make the act right\u2014necessarily less praiseworthy or even morally suspect? I shall argue that the answer is No. A pure motive of duty can ground full moral worth, provided (i) that the de-dicto desire is not a bare abstraction but a practical commitment whose content is continually regulated by the best available moral reasons, and (ii) that the agent\u2019s self-conscious allegiance to rightness expresses a distinct value\u2014respect for persons as free and equal\u2014that is not reducible to the first-order reasons that happen to apply in a given case. When these two conditions are met, dutiful action is not fetishistic but rather manifests the agent\u2019s practical identity as a moral equalizer; it is praiseworthy because it exhibits a form of self-governance that ensures reliability, impartiality and responsiveness to moral reasons across contexts. \n\n2. Mapping the Dispute: De Dicto vs. De Re Motivation\n\nTalk of \u201cacting from duty\u201d is ambiguous between two kinds of motivational content:\n\na. De re (object-directed) motive: wanting to relieve this child\u2019s pain, to promote that person\u2019s autonomy, etc.  \nb. De dicto (description-directed) motive: wanting, of the available actions, to do the one that is morally required (or not morally forbidden).\n\nCritics of the de-dicto motive argue that, when it is the exclusive driver, the agent\u2019s psychology is improperly detached from the values that ground moral requirements. Their worry comes in two forms:\n\nThe Fetish Worry (e.g. Smith): The agent\u2019s primary \u201cobject of concern\u201d becomes the abstract property of rightness itself, as though morality were a shiny trinket rather than something about people\u2019s lives.\n\nThe Alienation Worry (Williams, Stocker): If one saves a friend from drowning \u201cbecause duty demands it\u201d rather than out of friendship, one fails to show genuine concern for the friend; moral deliberation has intruded where personal concern ought to rule.\n\nBoth worries assume that right-respecting motivation is motivationally inert unless it is backed by first-order concern for the concrete values that underlie rightness. I shall contest that assumption.\n\n3. A Kantian Precedent\u2014and Its Misreadings\n\nKant notoriously held that actions possess moral worth only when they are done \u201cfrom duty.\u201d Contemporary critics often read him as valorizing sheer rule-obedience; yet Kant\u2019s text depicts the moral motive as reverence for the moral law, which itself is a law of equal respect. On this reading, to act from duty is not to be moved by an empty label but to be moved by recognition that one\u2019s maxim must be justified to every rational being. That recognition is not a psychological symptom of alienation but of moral self-legislation\u2014an attitude specifically oriented to others\u2019 equal autonomy. \n\nBarbara Herman\u2019s distinction between \u201cdeliberative priority\u201d and \u201cmotivating efficacy\u201d helps here. Rightness has deliberative priority\u2014entering as a filter on admissible maxims\u2014but concrete reasons supply much of the motivational energy. Yet even if, per the stipulated case, no concrete sympathetic feeling is present, the respect-based motive itself signifies acknowledgement of every person\u2019s claim to justification. That is a substantive attitude, not an empty fetish.\n\n4. Two Conditions for Praiseworthy Dutiful Action\n\nCondition 1: Normative Tracking\n\nThe de-dicto desire must be reliably and non-accidentally connected to correct moral verdicts. If the agent\u2019s conception of \u201cwhat is right\u201d floats free of genuine reasons\u2014say, it is fixed rigidly by an authority or tribal code\u2014then even if she acts from that desire, her conformity to duty is at best lucky. Moral worth requires that the agent\u2019s will exhibit practical wisdom: a sensitivity to the moral landscape.\n\nCondition 2: Respect-Expressive Form\n\nDutiful action must manifest respect for persons as autonomous law-givers. This condition distinguishes the valuable form of de-dicto motivation from slavish rule-worship. The praiseworthy agent does not bow to morality as a foreign power; she identifies with it as the voice of her own and others\u2019 reason. Thus her dutiful act is an expression of relational equality, not an object-directed fetish.\n\nMeeting these conditions is sufficient (though not necessary) for moral worth irrespective of whether concrete sympathies are present.\n\n5. Why the Two Conditions Matter\n\na. Reliability. De-re motives often map well onto right actions but can misfire in atypical cases. A parent\u2019s intense love may motivate helping his child even when doing so violates serious duties to others. The de-dicto desire to do the right thing, if properly regulated, provides an impartial corrective that prevents such misfires.\n\nb. Impartiality. Particularistic sentiments tend to be partial by nature. The de-dicto motive treats like cases alike; it is structurally egalitarian.\n\nc. Integrity of Practical Identity. By centering one\u2019s agency on the project of \u201cgetting morality right,\u201d the agent forges a unifying commitment that can organize diverse subordinate motives without collapsing into obsessive moralistic neurosis.\n\n6. Addressing the Fetish Worry\n\nMichael Smith imagines an agent who is fascinated by \u201cthe property moral rightness.\u201d He infers that such an agent values a metaphysical property rather than the features that make acts right. Yet if Condition 1 is satisfied, then \u201crightness\u201d is precisely the formal status of being justified by the best balance of those very features. Valuing rightness is reflexive valuing of whatever reasons survive critical scrutiny. Far from valuing an irrelevant property, the agent values the whole set of morally relevant features under a unifying description.\n\nAn analogy: a scientist may desire \u201cto believe what the evidence supports.\u201d This is not a fetish for the property of evidential support but an attitude of epistemic conscientiousness. Likewise, the dutiful agent\u2019s meta-desire is a form of moral conscientiousness.\n\n7. Addressing the Alienation Worry\n\nBernard Williams\u2019 famous case: Jim can save Pedro\u2019s life but only because utilitarian morality requires it. Williams complains that Jim\u2019s deliberation sidelines his personal concern. Yet note: The question is not whether first-order concern is absent, but whether its absence undermines moral worth. Suppose Jim has no warm feelings for Pedro (perhaps they\u2019re strangers) but acts solely from the de-dicto motive. According to Williams, this reveals a chilling abstraction. According to my view, Jim\u2019s act displays respect for Pedro\u2019s status as a moral equal\u2014indeed, it treats Pedro not merely as an object of sympathy (which might or might not arise) but as a co-legislator of the moral law. \n\nMoreover, the presence of a de-dicto motive need not exclude first-order sentiments. The agent who says \u201cI saved you because it was the right thing to do\u201d can also feel friendship or compassion; the abstract statement can be a shorthand for a deliberative structure, not a full psychological report. The alienation critique overreads the phenomenology of moral language.\n\n8. Objection: The Empty Container Reply\n\nSomeone might concede my two conditions but protest that they covertly install de-re motivational content: sensitivity to reasons (Condition 1) and respect for persons (Condition 2) are concrete values; therefore, the agent is not \u201csolely\u201d de-dictally motivated after all.\n\nReply: Sensitivity and respect function as second-order dispositions governing how the de-dicto desire operates, rather than as first-order motives. The immediate desire is still \u201cto do what is right.\u201d What ensures its correctness is the background intellectual and affective architecture. Compare: The utilitarian may be moved by the de-dicto desire \u201cto maximize utility,\u201d yet she must possess competency at evaluating utility, or else her will is malformed. That does not show she is moved by each concrete welfare consideration as such; it shows only that her de-dicto motive is guided. Similarly, respect for persons enters as the constitutive ideal of rightness\u2014it gives content to the de-dicto aim without replacing it.\n\n9. Two Illustrative Cases\n\nCase A: The Steadfast Judge\n\nJudge Adams, known for her impeccable impartiality, must decide a case involving her childhood friend. She feels potent affection for the friend, who pleads for leniency. Nevertheless, Adams sentences strictly in accordance with just precedents, motivated by her pledge to uphold what is right. She consciously sets aside her personal feeling. Critics might call her cold, but most would agree her action is morally worthy, precisely because it manifests fidelity to law and to the equal rights of unknown litigants. Here, the de-dicto desire counteracts partial sympathetic motives; its worth is patent.\n\nCase B: The Exhausted Samaritan\n\nRosa, a disaster-relief nurse, has been on duty for 36 hours, emotionally numb and physically drained. Her empathic reserves are depleted; she feels no warmth when yet another victim is wheeled in. What keeps her going is a disciplined commitment: \u201cThese people deserve care, and giving it is the right thing to do.\u201d She proceeds to treat the patient conscientiously. Surely Rosa\u2019s action is praiseworthy; to demand lively sympathy under such conditions would be heroic but not morally required. The dutiful motive suffices.\n\n10. Positive Payoffs: Why Prize the Dutiful Agent?\n\nFirst, reliability across contexts where natural sympathy fails (remote duties, justice in distribution, environmental duties to future generations).  \n\nSecond, humility: De-dicto motivation recognizes the limits of one\u2019s emotional palette; it does not mistake the presence of feeling for the presence of obligation.  \n\nThird, solidarity: By acting from an ideal that any rational being could share, the agent signals moral fellowship unmediated by special ties or sentiments.\n\n11. Theoretical Integration: Moral Worth as a Function of Practical Rationality\n\nWe can generalize: An act has moral worth when it issues from a will whose governing maxim is suitably responsive to moral reasons under a practical identity that affirms others as equals. Whether the motivational content is de-re or de-dicto is, on this account, less important than whether the will is normatively guided and respect-expressive. Hence, the exclusive valorization of de-re motives is misguided; de-dicto motives can instantiate the same rational structure.\n\n12. Revisiting the Critics\n\nStocker\u2019s charge that modern moral theories \u201cleave a moral vacuum\u201d because they ignore motives rings true against a certain hyper-intellectualized moralism. But permitting de-dicto motives does not entail ignoring motives; it widens the palette. Similarly, Wolf\u2019s \u201cMoral Saints\u201d worry\u2014that agents obsessed with being morally perfect lose the capacity for personal flourishing\u2014targets extremism. A healthy de-dicto motive need not crowd out non-moral projects; it sets a threshold of permissibility, after which plural ends can flourish.\n\n13. Objection: The Redundancy Worry\n\nWhy not say that de-dicto desire is instrumentally useful but the real ground of praise is the agent\u2019s capacity to track reasons (practical wisdom)? Then duty drops out as a superfluous layer.\n\nReply: The value of taking rightness itself as one\u2019s explicit aim is that it renders one\u2019s agency transparently accountable. It is constitutive of acting *as* a moral agent rather than as a coincidentally well-disposed empathizer. The public-regarding stance\u2014\u201cI do this because it is what anyone similarly situated ought to do\u201d\u2014has moral meaning beyond the bare fact of correctness. It acknowledges a common normative standpoint, which itself is worthy of praise.\n\n14. Relations to Virtue Ethics and Rails of Care\n\nVirtue ethicists might reply that dutiful action lacks \u201ceudaimonic integration\u201d: moral reasons appear as external impositions, not as expressions of the agent\u2019s character. I answer that the motive of duty can itself be a stable virtue\u2014call it conscientiousness\u2014whose internal good is precisely the maintenance of equal respect. Moreover, where particular virtues conflict, conscientiousness adjudicates, thereby enabling harmonious integrity.\n\nCare ethicists worry that duty-first agents overlook relationships. Yet nothing in the de-dicto motive forbids attending to relational contexts; it merely ensures that care is delivered as something owed, not merely as optional benevolence.\n\n15. A Final Example: The Climate Voter\n\nLee cares little about polar bears or abstract future harms, but she has internalized the de-dicto maxim \u201cvote for policies that are morally right.\u201d After careful study she judges, reluctantly, that aggressive climate action is required. On voting day, her friends offer a beach trip; she forgoes it and casts her vote. Her motive is thinly de-dicto; nonetheless, her act contributes to intergenerational justice. Praising Lee is appropriate, for she embodies citizens\u2019 duty to justify collective coercion. If everyone acted thus, large-scale moral goods would be better secured than if we relied solely on spontaneous empathy for future strangers.\n\n16. Conclusion\n\nA de-dicto desire to do what is morally right can fully ground moral worth, provided it meets two adequacy conditions: reliable normative tracking and respect-expressive form. When those are in place, the dutiful agent is not a fetishist but a self-legislating equalizer; her motivation secures impartiality, reliability, and public accountability. The fetish and alienation critiques misfire because they misconstrue the phenomenology of duty: they imagine a vacuous abstraction where in fact there is a substantive commitment to common moral governance. Accordingly, acting solely from duty can be\u2014not just sufficient for minimal moral decency\u2014but positively praiseworthy.", "output_tokens": 3165, "reasoning_tokens": 256}

Introduction: The Puzzle\n\nThe ordinary thought that morality is about concrete concern for people, animals, and the planet puts pressure on a Kantian-sounding ideal: acting \u201cfrom duty\u201d in the austere sense of treating the fact that an act is morally right, as such, as one\u2019s sole motivating consideration.  Railton, Stocker, and Herman worry that such agents are \u201cmoral fetishists,\u201d estranged from what truly matters.  Yet Kant\u2019s own analysis of moral worth relies precisely on the idea that an indifferent, even depressed, shopkeeper can still deserve esteem if he charges fair prices only because it is right.  Who is correct?\n\nI defend the following thesis:\n\n     An agent whose sole first-order motive is the abstract desire to do what is morally right can act with full moral worth, provided (i) that desire expresses a stable and reliable sensitivity to the underlying reasons that make actions right, and (ii) the agent\u2019s practical deliberation is properly integrated with those reasons.  Moral worth, on this view, consists not in the presence of concrete sentiments but in a certain quality of rational will: a reason-responsive disposition to treat moral reasons as decisive.\n\nThe argument proceeds in six steps.  (1) I disambiguate \u201cacting from duty,\u201d introducing distinctions between de dicto and de re moral motivation, first- and higher-order desires, and moral rightness vs. the grounds of rightness.  (2) I advance a positive account of why a de dicto motive can ground praiseworthiness\u2014call it the \u201creason-responsive will\u201d account.  (3) I show how this account explains the special value Kant saw in acting from duty while avoiding fetishism.  (4) I answer four leading objections: the fetishism objection, the alienation objection, the emotional impoverishment objection, and the practical unreliability objection.  (5) I illustrate with three test cases that sharpen the dialectic.  (6) I conclude by situating the proposal in contemporary debates about quality-of-will theories.\n\nTotal length: roughly 2,000 words.\n\n2. Mapping the Conceptual Terrain\n\na. De dicto vs. de re moral motivation  \nIn de re moral motivation I desire, say, to keep my promise because it is a promise.  In de dicto moral motivation I desire, simply, to do whatever is morally right, whatever that turns out to be.  The dispute centers on whether the latter, abstract desire alone can underwrite moral worth.\n\nb. First-order vs. higher-order desires  \nOne can have a first-order desire to do the right thing while also endorsing that desire at a higher level (\u201cI want to want to do what is right\u201d).  Praiseworthiness depends, I argue, on the integrated higher-order picture of oneself as a responsible agent, not merely on the presence of a bare first-order push.\n\nc. Right-making features vs. the fact of rightness  \nAn act is right because of concrete features\u2014minimizing suffering, honoring rights, etc.  The critic insists that being moved only by the fact that the act is right misses these underlying values.  My reply will hinge on showing that genuine responsiveness to \u201crightness\u201d can implicitly track those very features, even if they are not the content of the conscious motive.\n\n3. A Positive Proposal: The Reason-Responsive-Will Account\n\nWhat, exactly, confers moral worth?  Following Kant, Strawson, and recent \u201cquality of will\u201d theorists (Arpaly, Markovits, Skorupski), I locate worth not in which desire one feels, but in how one\u2019s will is attuned to moral reasons.  An agent acts with moral worth if:\n\n1. She recognizes that moral considerations decisively favor the action.  \n2. This recognition reliably guides her conduct.  \n3. She acts from a disposition that is stably connected to those considerations, rather than, say, luck or fear.\n\nCall this a reason-responsive disposition.  The content of the first-order desire\u2014\u201cdo right\u201d\u2014is morally generic, but its functional role is to make the agent reliably sensitive to concrete right-makers.  Two explanatory points follow.\n\nReliability.  A general love of rightness, when sincerely held, is an excellent predictor of right action across contexts, including unfamiliar ones where concrete sympathy may mislead.  It therefore satisfies the reliability condition on moral worth.\n\nEpistemic humility.  Agents often face moral uncertainty; they may not know exactly which feature of a situation grounds rightness.  A de dicto desire allows them to act correctly without presuming infallible grasp of all right-making properties.  Far from fetishistic, it is a rational safeguard against error.\n\n4. Avoiding Fetishism: Respect Forms of Valuing\n\nWhy is the \u201cdesire to do what is right\u201d not a fetish?  Because valuing something under an abstract description can itself be an authentic mode of valuing the particulars subsumed by that description.  Compare: loving \u201cmy children, whoever they turn out to be\u201d is not a fetish; it is a form of unconditional commitment.  Similarly, I manifest respect for persons by treating their claims as binding, even on days when I am too tired to feel tender concern.  The crucial point is integration: the de dicto motive must be formed and sustained by appreciation of moral reasons over time, not by brute conformism.\n\n5. Four Objections Answered\n\nObjection 1: The Fetishism Charge (Railton).  If you desire only \u201cright action,\u201d you treat rightness like a collector treats rare stamps\u2014prized for its own sake, detached from what makes stamps beautiful.  \n\nReply.  The stamp analogy fails because moral rightness is an essentially reason-laden property: to want rightness just is to want what there are overriding reasons to do.  Wanting stamps, by contrast, need not track any value internal to the stamps\u2019 being stamps.  Thus the fetish worry conflates an evaluatively empty predicate (\u201cbeing a stamp\u201d) with a normatively loaded one (\u201cbeing morally required\u201d).\n\nObjection 2: Alienation (Stocker).  Your friend visits you in hospital solely out of duty; you feel chilled.  That shows duty motives lack value.\n\nReply.  Two points.  (a) The emotional disappointment concerns interpersonal warmth, not moral worth.  A nurse who dutifully tends me deserves esteem even if we lack intimacy.  (b) The case conflates sufficiency with preferability.  Granting that mixed motives (duty + affection) are ideal, it does not follow that pure duty is insufficient for worth.\n\nObjection 3: Emotional impoverishment.  Agents driven by duty alone lack compassion, so their actions express a deficient moral character.\n\nReply.  A disposition to act for moral reasons is itself a significant moral virtue\u2014call it conscientiousness.  One can admire a firefighter\u2019s principled courage even if he feels no compassion while charging into flames.  Moreover, the reason-responsive framework encourages, though it does not require, cultivation of concrete sympathies as instrumental to recognizing moral reasons quickly.  Thus duty-based agents are not condemned to emotional aridity.\n\nObjection 4: Reliability.  Abstract commitment may fail when the agent misidentifies the right act; concrete concern for welfare offers a firmer guide.\n\nReply.  The reliability calculus cuts both ways.  Sympathy can misfire (implicit bias, near-sighted altruism).  A principled desire tracks reasons across cases, provided the agent is rational and reflective.  Empirical data on moral reasoning (e.g., the Kohlberg/Gilligan debates) suggest that principled reasoning often corrects parochial feeling.  Hence duty motivation can be at least as reliable as sentiment.\n\n6. Three Test Cases\n\nCase 1: The Nuclear Technician.  Jordana works in a control room.  She double-checks safety protocols nightly.  Her sole conscious motive is that it is morally required; she feels no warmth toward distant strangers who would die in a meltdown.  Yet her vigilance stems from stable recognition of their rights to life and security.  Intuitively, Jordana is highly praiseworthy\u2014indeed more so than a technician moved by thrill-seeking heroism.\n\nCase 2: The Misanthrope Revisited (Kant).  A reclusive philanthropist sends anonymous donations only because \u201cit is the right thing to do.\u201d  He dislikes people.  Is he worthy of esteem?  According to the reason-responsive account, yes: he reliably acts on moral reasons despite adverse inclinations.  His lack of affection is lamentable, but the quality of his will\u2014placing duty above dislike\u2014merits praise.\n\nCase 3: The Disaster Triage Doctor.  Under chaotic conditions Dr. Liu cannot grasp which patient will benefit most.  She therefore follows a well-validated utilitarian protocol purely out of duty to do what is right.  Her abstract motive allows swift, impartial action where concrete compassion would be overwhelmed.  Again, we judge her praiseworthy.\n\nThese examples show that pure duty motivation, when properly integrated, can embody moral dedication, foresight, and impartiality\u2014traits at the heart of what we admire.\n\n7. Why Praiseworthiness?  Two Deeper Explanations\n\nFirst, epistemic difficulty.  Moral reality is complex.  A meta-desire to conform to moral reasons elegantly coordinates deliberation under uncertainty.  The dutiful agent models the stance of an inquirer: \u201cWhatever turns out to be required, that I shall do.\u201d  This intellectual humility is itself morally admirable.\n\nSecond, impartial respect.  Treating actions under the formal guise of rightness reflects the idea that each person\u2019s reasons count equally, independent of my affective ties.  The de dicto motive therefore symbolizes recognition of others as moral equals, a core Kantian insight.\n\n8. Addressing a Residual Worry: Is Content Irrelevant?\n\nOne might object that my view collapses into a de re view: because the desire to do what is right is responsive to right-making considerations, the agent is effectively motivated by those considerations after all.  Not quite.  The content of the motivating desire remains abstract; what matters is the functional link between that desire and the agent\u2019s deliberative capacities.  We need not say she \u201cdesired to relieve suffering.\u201d  It is enough that her abstract desire reliably would have changed had she learned that relieving suffering was not, after all, required in present circumstances.  Thus de dicto and de re motives remain distinct, yet the de dicto motive is not blind.\n\n9. Relation to Existing Literature\n\nArpaly (2003) argues that acting from the right reasons, even unknowingly so, suffices for praiseworthiness.  Markovits (2010) responds that moral worth requires acting for moral reasons as such.  My account blends their insights: the agent must be guided by moral reasons (Arpaly) but may do so under the abstract description \u201cwhat is morally required\u201d (Markovits), provided the guiding disposition is reason-responsive.\n\n10. Conclusion\n\nActing merely from the desire to do what is morally right can fully suffice for moral worth.  The key lies not in the descriptive richness of one\u2019s motive but in its rational quality: its stability, responsiveness, and integration with moral reasons.  Fetishism and alienation arise only when the desire is detached from those reasons\u2014when it becomes a matter of social signaling, scrupulosity, or blind rule-worship.  Properly understood, however, duty motivation is a rational, impartial, and often epistemically superior vehicle for moral agency.

Introduction and Thesis  \n\nDo epistemic agents have to know what they are doing epistemically in order to be doing it? More precisely: must a subject be consciously aware of the reasons on which a belief or other cognitive state is based for that state to enjoy an epistemic status\u2014say, to be justified? I shall argue that the answer is \u201cno.\u201d Conscious awareness of one\u2019s reasons is sufficient for bona fide epistemic basing, but it is not necessary. What *is* necessary is that (i) the belief be causally sustained by the relevant reasons in a way that makes those reasons explanatory at the personal level, and (ii) the subject have a disposition to achieve conscious access to the reasons on reflective demand. If these conditions are met, a mental state can be epistemically based on reasons even when, as a matter of phenomenology, the subject is unaware of any such reasons at the time.\n\nThe argument proceeds in six stages. Section 2 disentangles the key notions: \u201creasons,\u201d \u201cbasing,\u201d and \u201cawareness.\u201d Section 3 lays out the principal motivations for the \u201cawareness requirement.\u201d Section 4 develops counter-considerations drawn from empirical psychology and ordinary epistemic practice. Section 5 offers a two-tier \u201cdispositional accessibility\u201d account that preserves what is compelling in the awareness requirement while allowing epistemic credit to automatic processes. Section 6 replies to three prominent objections: the Responsibility Objection, the Deviant-Causality Objection, and the Blindsight Objection. Section 7 concludes by summarizing the broader implications for epistemology and cognitive science.\n\n2. Preliminary Distinctions  \n\n2.1 Normative vs. Motivating Reasons  \nNormative epistemic reasons are facts that count in favor of believing p (e.g., \u201cthe gauge reads \u2018E\u2019\u201d is a reason to believe one is low on fuel). Motivating reasons are the reasons for which the subject actually believes p; they enter the causal-explanatory story of how the belief is formed or sustained. The basing relation concerns motivating reasons.\n\n2.2 Personal-Level vs. Subpersonal Causation  \nA stimulus can cause a neuron to fire (subpersonal), but that neuronal spike is not the agent\u2019s reason. Personal-level causation is the level at which we attribute beliefs, desires, intentions, and reasons to whole agents. Automatic inferences delivered by encapsulated modules\u2014say, face recognition\u2014must be connectable to the agent\u2019s web of commitments to count as personal-level.\n\n2.3 Occurrent vs. Dispositional Awareness  \nOccurrent awareness is conscious access *right now*. Dispositional awareness is the ability to bring the relevant content to consciousness through reflection or inquiry. The traditional awareness requirement is typically formulated in occurrent terms. A weaker, dispositional version will turn out to be all we need.\n\n3. The Case for the Awareness Requirement  \n\nThree main lines of argument motivate the claim that justification requires occurrent awareness of one\u2019s reasons:\n\nA. The Transparency Argument  \nBelief is *transparent to the question whether p is true* (Evans, Moran). When one asks, \u201cDo I believe that p?\u201d one answers by considering whether p. This transparency is alleged to break down if the reasons for p are unconscious; hence, the belief would be epistemically opaque, undermining its status as reason-based.\n\nB. The Guidance Argument  \nTo be creditworthy, an agent must guide her belief by reasons she recognizes. Otherwise, the belief is at best a happy accident. Active guidance seems to require explicit, occurrent access to the guiding considerations.\n\nC. The Responsibility Argument  \nEpistemic norms have an element of responsibility: we appraise agents, praise and blame them, and demand reasons. If subjects cannot articulate any grounds for their beliefs, how can they be held responsible for believing well or badly?\n\nThese arguments have force, but none is decisive. Each overreaches by moving from a genuine insight\u2014awareness enhances epistemic standing\u2014to the stronger conclusion that awareness is necessary. \n\n4. Counter-Considerations: Why Awareness Cannot Be Necessary  \n\n4.1 Ubiquitous Automaticity  \nPerception, memory retrieval, language comprehension, and even much mathematical intuition are subpersonal and automatic, yet obviously contribute to epistemic justification. A radiologist \u201cjust sees\u201d the hairline fracture; a chess grandmaster \u201cjust knows\u201d that the knight move is winning. If we deny that these beliefs are justified because the reasons remain unconscious, we commit ourselves to skepticism about most ordinary knowledge.\n\n4.2 Developmental and Cross-Species Evidence  \nInfants track gaze direction to locate hidden objects; dogs follow human pointing. If conscious reflection were required for epistemic justification, creatures lacking sophisticated metacognition could never possess justified beliefs. Yet it is counterintuitive to say an adult dog that tracks a thrown ball has no justified expectation about its landing place.\n\n4.3 The Cognitive Burden Problem  \nHuman cognitive resources are limited. Requiring occurrent awareness of all reasons would paralyze inquiry; one could never believe anything without first conducting a metacognitive audit. A plausible epistemology must respect bounded rationality.\n\n4.4 The Self-Defeat Problem  \nMeeting the awareness requirement itself depends on further, often unconscious processes (e.g., retrieving memories). If only conscious processes can ground justification, then the very reasons retrieved to satisfy the requirement would be unjustified, triggering regress.\n\nTaken together, these considerations shift the burden of proof: unless awareness advocates can explain away the intuitive force of these cases, awareness cannot be necessary.\n\n5. A Dispositional Accessibility Account  \n\n5.1 The Core Proposal  \nA belief B is epistemically based on a body of reasons R iff:\n\n(DA-1) B is causally sustained by R in a way that preserves the counterfactual dependence characteristic of basing: had R been different, B would have differed accordingly.  \n(DA-2) The subject is disposed, under conditions of critical reflection and absent defeating pressures, to access R and to recognize their epistemic relevance.\n\nOccurrent consciousness is not required, but *cognitive ownership* is: the reasons must belong to the subject\u2019s rational architecture such that she can\u2014given sufficient prompting\u2014bring them to light.\n\n5.2 Why DA Satisfies the Original Motivations  \nTransparency: If the subject reflects, the reasons do become transparent; the guidance function is preserved dispositionally.  \nGuidance: Real-time guidance can be mediated by subpersonal mechanisms that are nonetheless integrated with the agent\u2019s goals and background knowledge; guidance need not be consciously mediated.  \nResponsibility: When asked, a competent subject can articulate at least schematic reasons (\u201cThe gauge said E\u201d). Failure to do so indicates either that DA-2 is unmet or that the subject is in abnormal conditions (fatigue, intimidation), which we routinely excuse.\n\n5.3 Relation to Existing Theories  \nDA shares affinities with Conee & Feldman\u2019s mentalist evidentialism but relaxes their \u201cawareness\u201d clause; with Goldman\u2019s reliabilism but imposes an accessibility constraint; and with virtue epistemology in assigning responsibility to the agent\u2019s stable competences. It aims to integrate the strongest intuitions from each tradition.\n\n6. Reply to Objections  \n\n6.1 The Responsibility Objection  \n\u201cWithout awareness, there is no responsibility.\u201d \u2014 Reply: Responsibility admits degrees. We hold people responsible for careless driving even when they are unaware of some hazard they should have noticed; what matters is their *ability* to notice. Similarly, an epistemic agent who can, upon reflection, cite her perceptual evidence is responsible, even if she hasn\u2019t actually done the reflective work at t.\n\n6.2 The Deviant-Causality Objection  \n\u201cCausal relations can be deviant; DA-1 by itself cannot secure non-deviant basing.\u201d \u2014 Reply: DA-2 blocks deviance. Suppose a hypnotist implants a belief via reasons that never become accessible; DA-2 fails, so no basing. Suppose, by contrast, the subject\u2019s perceptual system subpersonally computes depth cues she can later access (\u201cIt looked nearer than the other object\u201d). DA-2 holds, hence genuine basing.\n\n6.3 The Blindsight Challenge  \nBlindsighted patients guess correctly about stimuli they do not see. Are these guesses justified on DA? No. Although subpersonal visual information causally sustains the guess (DA-1), patients lack the disposition to access it as epistemic evidence; indeed, they deny having any basis. DA-2 fails, vindicating the intuition that blindsight yields reliability without justification.\n\n7. Conclusion  \n\nLack of *occurrent* awareness does not preclude epistemic basing. What matters is that the reasons be (i) appropriately explanatory at the personal level and (ii) dispositionally accessible for reflection. This middle ground secures the virtues that motivate the awareness requirement\u2014transparency, guidance, responsibility\u2014while accommodating the empirical reality that much of our cognitive labor is automatic. Epistemic justification, on this view, is a partnership between the luminous and the subterranean: conscious reflection ratifies and regulates an underlying architecture of mostly unconscious but genuinely reason-giving processes.", "output_tokens": 2358, "reasoning_tokens": 448}

I shall argue that it does not. Occurrent, explicit awareness of one\u2019s grounds is neither necessary nor sufficient for the basing relation that underwrites epistemic justification. Instead, what matters is that (i) the subject\u2019s cognitive system is properly sensitive to the truth-conducive features that constitute the reasons, and (ii) the subject retains a standing capacity to vindicate the state by citably appealing to those features under conditions of critical reflection. Conscious access is thus optional at the moment of belief\u2010formation, even though accessibility in principle\u2014and the rational competence it manifests\u2014remains indispensable. Once these distinctions are in place, the apparent tension between automatic, modular processes and genuine epistemic basing dissolves: such processes can confer justification so long as they are reason-responsive in the right way and embedded in an agent who could, if prompted, bring the operative grounds to reflective awareness.\n\nThe remainder of the essay unfolds as follows. Section 1 clarifies the target phenomenon\u2014the basing relation\u2014and isolates three distinct readings of the awareness requirement. Section 2 reconstructs the best arguments for the strong awareness thesis, according to which occurrent consciousness of one\u2019s reasons is required for justification. Section 3 marshals empirical and conceptual considerations that jointly undermine this thesis. Section 4 develops a moderate, competence-based account that accommodates non-conscious, subpersonal reasoning while retaining the link between reasons and epistemic responsibility. Section 5 addresses two residual worries: first, that the view lapses into externalism by relocating epistemic credit to subpersonal mechanisms; second, that it cannot explain cases of epistemic defeat that seemingly depend on conscious reflection. Section 6 concludes by summarizing the dialectical upshot and sketching avenues for further research.\n\n1. Clarifying basing and three awareness theses\n\n\u201cR\u2019s belief that p is based on reason q\u201d can be used in at least three registers:\n\na) Etiological: q causally explains R\u2019s holding p.  \nb) Rationalizing: q makes R\u2019s believing p intelligible as an exercise of her rational agency.  \nc) Epistemic: q confers justification on R\u2019s believing p.\n\nWhile these dimensions often coincide, they can come apart. A hypnotist might causally implant a belief in virtue of suggestion (a), rendering it neither rationally intelligible (b) nor justified (c). The present debate concerns the epistemic dimension: does q confer justification only when R is consciously aware of q when forming or sustaining the belief that p?\n\nAwareness can itself be interpreted in three increasingly demanding ways:\n\n1. Occurrent-phenomenal: R is vividly representing q as a premise at the very moment she comes to believe p.  \n2. Standing-access: R is not currently thinking about q but could, without fresh empirical inquiry, cite q if asked why she believes p.  \n3. Implicit-structural: q figures in the information-processing causal chain that produces R\u2019s belief, though R could not articulate q even upon reflection.\n\nThe strong awareness thesis endorses (1); accessibilist internalism accepts (2); externalist reliabilism is friendly to (3). My task is to show that (1) is untenable and that something like (2) suffices for epistemic basing. I remain neutral between internalist and externalist embellishments, aiming only to secure the claim that conscious occurrent awareness is not necessary.\n\n2. Arguments for the strong awareness thesis\n\nA. The agency argument: Epistemic appraisal seems to presuppose rational agency. One is responsible for a belief only if one formed it as the result of one\u2019s own reasoning rather than as a passive receptacle of causes. Because agency is paradigmatically conscious, having reasons play the right role allegedly requires their conscious citation.\n\nB. The transparency argument: Introspection exhibits a peculiar transparency: when one asks \u201cWhy do I believe that p?\u201d one immediately considers the truth of p, not the causal path by which the belief was produced. This suggests that justification is tied to reasons that are present to the subject\u2019s mind.\n\nC. The deontic argument: Ought implies can. If justification confers epistemic permissibility, the subject must have control over whether to believe. Control, in turn, requires conscious appreciation of reasons. Otherwise the normativity of epistemic \u201cought\u201ds would collapse into mere biological good fortune.\n\nCollectively, these arguments invite the verdict that absence of conscious awareness undermines basing, and hence justification.\n\n3. Problems for the strong awareness thesis\n\n3.1 Ubiquity of non-conscious cognitive success\nConsider expert radiologists who, at a glance, correctly identify subtle tumors on a scan yet are unable to verbalize the decisive features. Or the famed Japanese \u201cchicken-sexers,\u201d who reliably sort male from female chicks within seconds without access to an explicit rule. These agents are epistemically justified: we trust their judgments, rely on them for surgery scheduling, or breed programs. Their reliability is not flukish; it is systematic and attributable to cultivated perceptual attunement to statistically diagnostic cues. Requiring occurrent awareness would bizarrely strip these experts of justification, despite their epistemic superiority to novices who can cite textbook indicators but misclassify.\n\n3.2 Perception as reason without awareness\nIf any cognitive domain is plausibly justified without occurrent awareness of reasons, it is ordinary perception. Standing in daylight I believe \u201cThere is a coffee mug on my desk\u201d because I see it. Yet, in forming that belief, I do not consciously rehearse \u201cBecause the lighting is good, my eyes function normally, and mugs typically look like that shape.\u201d The visual system delivers content whose justificatory pedigree is implicit in its proper functioning, not in my contemporaneous consciousness of optical principles.\n\n3.3 The \u201cconsciousness is not sufficient\u201d consideration\nCases of confabulation and motivated reasoning reveal that conscious awareness\u2014even of actual evidence\u2014fails to guarantee basing. A juror may overtly cite legitimate testimony while in fact convicting out of implicit bias. The availability of reasons to consciousness is compatible with their playing no causal role. Therefore, insistence on conscious awareness confuses an epistemic enabling condition with a poor proxy.\n\n3.4 Empirical evidence about temporal order\nNeuroscientific studies (e.g., Libet-style readiness potentials and Haidt\u2019s work on moral judgment) show that decisions often precede the subject\u2019s conscious awareness of reasons by hundreds of milliseconds. If mental causation requires such awareness, much of human reasoning would be rendered irrational ex hypothesi, an unattractive result bordering on skepticism.\n\nTogether, considerations (3.1)\u2013(3.4) tilt the scales: the strong awareness thesis sacrifices too many bona fide cases of justified belief and does not even secure basing when awareness is present. Something more nuanced is required.\n\n4. A competence-based account of basing\n\nThe empirical cases just canvassed suggest that justification depends on competence: the reliable, reasons-sensitive functioning of cognitive capacities. Let me articulate this idea more carefully.\n\nDefinition (Epistemic Competence): A cognitive disposition C is an epistemic competence regarding proposition-type \u03a6 if and only if (i) C reliably produces true \u03a6-beliefs across a sufficiently wide range of normal conditions, and (ii) C\u2019s reliability is modally robust, i.e., would continue under relevant nearby circumstances. Paradigm competences include normal vision, educated statistical inference, and expert pattern recognition.\n\nCompetence yields a distinctive sort of counterfactual dependence: had the truth-conducive features been absent, the competence would not have produced the \u03a6-belief. This is precisely what we want from reasons-responsiveness: the features that actually obtain (the reasons) make an explanatory difference to the belief\u2019s presence.\n\nHow does consciousness enter the picture? On my view, occurrent awareness is not constitutive of competence but is one way\u2014often a useful way\u2014of exercising it. What matters for basing is that the belief inherits its epistemic status from a mechanism whose reliability is keyed to the reasons, coupled with the agent\u2019s owning that mechanism as part of her rational repertoire. \u201cOwning\u201d is cashed out by standing-access awareness: upon reflective scrutiny, the agent can, at least in outline, articulate what would count as defeating conditions (e.g., bad lighting, blurry image) and would be disposed to revise the belief accordingly. This satisfies epistemic responsibility without inflating every belief episode into a phenomenologically crowded inference.\n\n4.1 Comparison with rival views\n\u2022 Pure reliabilism (process externalism) discards any awareness requirement. My position diverges by insisting that justification must be sensitive to the first-person perspective in a counterfactual sense: were the agent to seek reasons, she could supply them by deploying the very competence that produced the belief.\n\n\u2022 Accessibilist internalism equates justificatory status with what is actually accessible. I think this view is too conservative: recall the chicken-sexer who cannot fully articulate her evidence but can at least cite that \u201cthe pattern of down and wing vibration\u201d looks a certain way. That rudimentary articulation, plus her history of corrigibility, suffices\u2014even if she cannot specify the spectral frequency distribution that visually guides her.\n\n5. Two residual worries\n\nWorry 1: Does the competence view dissolve into externalism, rendering justification a matter of lucky subpersonal processes rather than the agent\u2019s rational control?\n\nResponse: The subpersonal competence must be integrated with higher-level dispositions to respond to counter-evidence. Suppose the radiologist learns that the scan had a software glitch producing false shadows; she retracts the tumor belief. This shows that her belief is not a mere reflex of a module but part of an interconnected rational system. Contrast with a brain-lesion patient who blurts out tumor diagnoses yet cannot heed negative feedback; his process lacks the modally robust sensitivity to reasons and thus fails to ground justification.\n\nWorry 2: Epistemic defeat seems to require conscious awareness. If the agent is unaware of the defeater, how can responsibilities concerning defeat be satisfied?\n\nResponse: Two points:\n\na) There are both possessed and unpossessed defeaters. Agents are responsible only for responding to defeaters within their cognitive ken.  \nb) My view happily allows that once the defeater becomes possessed\u2014i.e., once the agent becomes aware of it\u2014she must revise her belief. The competence account handles this because competences encode conditional connections not just to reasons for p but to defeaters of p; acquiring awareness of such conditions activates a revision disposition. Absence of awareness at t\u2081 is no bar to possessing a justified belief at t\u2081 so long as the agent stands ready to revise at t\u2082 upon learning of the defeater.\n\n6. Conclusion and prospects\n\nWe began with a prima facie plausible claim: that epistemic basing requires conscious awareness of one\u2019s reasons. I have argued that this claim, interpreted strongly, is untenable. Perception, skilled cognition, and the empirical science of decision making attest to widespread justified belief without occurrent awareness. Yet we need not slide into blind externalism. By invoking the notion of epistemic competence\u2014reliable, reasons-responsive capacities owned by the agent\u2014we secure both epistemic value and rational responsibility. Conscious access remains important as a reflective safeguard and for articulate deliberation, but it is not the sine qua non of justification.\n\nFuture work might enrich this competence framework by integrating it with virtue epistemology, exploring its implications for machine learning systems that lack phenomenology yet exhibit reason-responsiveness, and examining how it handles higher-order knowledge (knowing that one knows). If the arguments above are sound, they vindicate the epistemic legitimacy of our vast, automatic mental life\u2014granting the modular mind its rightful place in the economy of reasons.", "output_tokens": 2911, "reasoning_tokens": 448}

Orienting the debate  \n\nAt least since Plato\u2019s image of the \u201cwax tablet\u201d in the Theaetetus, epistemologists have worried about the connection between the mental causes of a belief and the *reasons* for which the believer holds it. One influential strand of that worry insists that for a belief to be *epistemically based*\u2014and thus to be justified rather than a mere happen\u00adstance\u2014it must be formed (or sustained) in light of reasons the subject is consciously aware of. This *access requirement* is attractive: it seems to capture the intuition that justification is something for which a subject can be called to account. Yet it sits uneasily with contemporary cognitive science, which teaches that a large share of our belief formation is accomplished by fast, automatic, modular systems that operate below the level of consciousness. The question, then, is whether lack of conscious awareness of one\u2019s reasons really rules out epistemic basing.  \n\nI shall argue that the answer is \u201cno.\u201d More precisely:  \n\nThesis. Conscious awareness is not a necessary condition for a mental state\u2019s being epistemically based on reasons. What matters is that the belief be causally sensitive, in the right explanatory way, to epistemic grounds that are *functionally available* to the believer\u2019s cognitive system, even if they never rise to occurrent consciousness.  \n\nThe argument unfolds in six steps. I begin by clarifying three distinctions that can easily be run together (Section 2). I then set out the access requirement and the motivations behind it (Section 3). Sections 4\u20135 offer a positive account of sub-personal basing and a battery of examples that make it plausible. Section 6 replies to the two most serious objections\u2014one about epistemic responsibility, the other about epistemic credit. I close by sketching a hybrid picture that preserves what is compelling in the access requirement while letting cognitive science have its due (Section 7).  \n\n2. Three preliminary distinctions  \n\nDistinction 1: Normative versus motivating reasons. A *normative* reason is a fact or consideration that counts in favor of believing. A *motivating* reason is the factor in light of which the subject actually believes. The basing relation concerns motivating reasons, though justificatory status then depends on whether those motivating reasons are also (or include) good normative ones.  \n\nDistinction 2: Doxastic versus propositional justification. One may be *propositionally* justified in believing p without actually believing it on those grounds. *Doxastic* justification requires that the belief be appropriately based. The present debate is entirely about doxastic justification: even if I have good evidence stored in memory, if my belief in p is the upshot of wishful thinking, it is not doxastically justified.  \n\nDistinction 3: Personal-level versus sub-personal representation. Philosophical reflection tends to privilege personal-level states\u2014those we can report, reason with, and cite in explanations that make sense to us as agents. But the cognitive architecture that produces those states includes sub-personal computations to which we lack introspective access. Nothing in the concept of a *reason* requires that it be personal-level; what matters is that it plays the right role in rationalizing the attitude.  \n\nThese distinctions clear the ground. The issue is whether motivating reasons must be *consciously* personal-level for a belief to enjoy doxastic justification.  \n\n3. The access requirement and its motivations  \n\nProponents of the access requirement (e.g., Fumerton, Alston, Steup) typically offer two lines of thought.  \n\n3.1. The Accountability Argument. Epistemic appraisal is a species of normative appraisal. Justification is, at least pro tanto, that in virtue of which it is appropriate to praise or blame a believer for her attitudes. Since we do not praise or blame people for things hidden from their consciousness, justificatory grounds must be consciously accessible.  \n\n3.2. The Non-Accidentalness Argument. Mere causal reliability is not enough for basing; the subject must treat the grounds *as* reasons. If I believe that the road is wet because I have been hypnotically programmed to form that belief whenever I see a red truck, the fact that the truck\u2019s color causally preceded my belief does not make it epistemically based. Conscious endorsement, or at least awareness, is what separates genuinely reason-responsive causation from deviant causal chains.  \n\nBoth arguments capture insights worth retaining. But neither compels the conclusion that basing demands occurrent consciousness. To see why, we first need a more discriminating account of what sub-personal basing could look like.  \n\n4. Basing without consciousness: a positive proposal  \n\nCall a cognitive transition *epistemically appropriate* just in case (i) it is sensitive to factors that are truth-reliable in the relevant environment, (ii) it occurs through a process that is part of the subject\u2019s standing cognitive repertoire, and (iii) if challenged, the subject could in principle recover or reconstruct those factors as considerations that *would* justify the belief.  \n\nPoint (iii)\u2014the *recoverability* condition\u2014allows us to retain an intuitive link to accountability without insisting on present-tense awareness. (We come back to why \u201cin principle\u201d is not a vacuous escape clause.) Given this picture, a belief can be based on reasons that are represented only sub-personally: they function in the cognitive system\u2019s information-processing, are available for later explicit articulation, and would be recruited by the subject when reflecting.  \n\nSuch *functional availability* is enough to satisfy the demand that the subject\u2019s belief be guided by reasons rather than merely caused. The relevant guidance is implemented by the cognitive architecture, not necessarily by conscious supervision.  \n\n5. Why the proposal is plausible: five cases  \n\nCase 1: Perceptual belief. Suppose I look out the window and believe there is a dog in the yard. My visual system extracts edges, motion parallax, color constancy, etc., delivering a high-level representation DOG-PRESENT. I could, if asked, cite what I take to be evidence (\u201cI see a wagging tail, floppy ears \u2026\u201d). But before such articulation, the sub-personal visual computations already encode reasons sufficient to justify the belief. If conscious awareness were necessary *ab initio*, no ordinary perceptual belief would count as doxastically justified, which is an untenable sceptical result.  \n\nCase 2: Implicit statistical reasoning. Tversky and Kahneman\u2019s subjects can correctly estimate frequencies when presented with arrays of dots even though they cannot consciously compute percentages. Their success is driven by automatic sampling mechanisms that track frequency information. When a subject judges, \u201cabout seventy percent are blue,\u201d her belief is sensitive to the proportion of blue dots\u2014a normative reason\u2014without being the upshot of any conscious calculation. Yet it is not luck: if the dot array had been different, she would have judged differently.  \n\nCase 3: The expert chess intuitor. A grandmaster glances at a position and says, \u201cWhite should play Qg4.\u201d Decades of practice have trained her pattern-recognition module to tag certain configurations as dangerous. She is not consciously aware of the twenty-five-ply refutation; nevertheless, her belief is explained by her internalization of patterns that historically track truth about good moves. We count her belief as epistemically excellent, not a mere hunch.  \n\nCase 4: Linguistic competence. I believe that (1) \u201cWho did you see?\u201d is grammatical but that (2) \u201cWho did you see him?\u201d is not. My belief is grounded in tacit knowledge of English syntax. I cannot formulate the Subjacency Condition, yet the sub-personal grammar engine applies it. This is a canonical example of justified belief grounded in reasons (syntactic constraints) of which the subject lacks conscious awareness.  \n\nCase 5: Blindsight with introspective access restored. In classic blindsight, patients guess the presence of stimuli they claim not to see. Suppose a subject is given training that allows her, on reflection, to cite reliable indicators (a \u201cfeeling of presence,\u201d slight muscle tension). After training, her guesses become beliefs she would defend verbally. At the moment of formation, she still lacks visual phenomenology, but the belief is based on sub-personal visual processing. Once again, justification seems to accrue.  \n\nThe common thread: in each case, the belief is the output of a cognitive process that tracks truth via sub-personal sensitivity to epistemic grounds. Demanding occurrent awareness would force us to declare all such beliefs unjustified, an implausible cost.  \n\n6. Objections and replies  \n\n6.1. The Responsibility Objection  \n\n\u201cYou dodge responsibility,\u201d the critic says. \u201cIf the subject cannot bring the reasons to consciousness, she cannot be held epistemically accountable. Justification without accountability is an empty honorific.\u201d  \n\nReply. Responsibility comes in degrees and modalities. Moral responsibility paradigms already distinguish between *attributability* (the state reflects on the agent\u2019s character) and *accountability* (the agent is fit to answer). Epistemic responsibility can be similarly disambiguated. A subject is *attributably* responsible for beliefs produced by her own standing cognitive equipment, provided she has no defeaters and no negligence in maintenance of that equipment. Accountability, in the sense of being able to articulate reasons on demand, is a higher bar that matters for *evaluative discourse* but not for the metaphysics of justification. The *recoverability* condition suffices: if, upon challenge, the subject can investigate and articulate reasons (e.g., \u201cWell, I looked, and there was clearly a dog\u201d), we have all the accountability we need.  \n\n6.2. The Credit Objection  \n\nAnother worry (Greco, Pritchard) is that epistemic goods confer credit only if the believer\u2019s success is because of her exercise of cognitive agency, not because of lucky factors outside her agential control. If sub-personal processes do the heavy lifting, does credit vanish?  \n\nReply. Agency is not exhausted by conscious supervision. Driving a car safely involves muscle-control micro-adjustments beyond consciousness; yet the safe arrival is creditable to the driver. Similarly, epistemic agency includes maintaining reliable perceptual systems, training pattern-recognition, and being disposed to off-load sub-tasks to specialized modules. Those sub-personal operations are constituents of the agent, not alien intruders. Hence credit is preserved. Removing credit would also undermine perceptual knowledge wholesale, an unacceptable consequence.  \n\n7. A conciliatory synthesis  \n\nStill, the access requirement captures something intuitive: a subject who could *in no way* bring her putative reasons to consciousness looks, from the armchair, akin to a mere conduit. To honor that intuition, we can articulate a *two-tier* model.  \n\nTier 1: Sub-personal basing confers *prima facie* doxastic justification, provided the belief derives from a process that (a) tracks truth in the local environment, (b) is part of the subject\u2019s standing cognitive architecture, and (c) yields content that would serve as an explicit reason were the subject to reflect.  \n\nTier 2: Reflective endorsement (which may, but need not, occur) upgrades justification by immunizing it against certain defeaters and by underwriting higher-order epistemic goods such as *understanding*.  \n\nThis model predicts that a novice\u2019s perceptual belief and an expert\u2019s reflective judgement can both be justified, but the latter enjoys an additional epistemic virtue. Conscious awareness, then, is an *enhancer* rather than a *precondition* of basing. The synthesis also explains why hypnotic causation and randomly reliable processes are excluded: they fail condition (c); there is nothing the subject could, even in principle, cite that would count as a reason.  \n\n8. Consequences and concluding remarks  \n\nThe conclusion that consciousness is not required for epistemic basing has several attractive upshots.  \n\n1. It aligns epistemology with cognitive science, which presents us with an architecture rife with information-processing we do not experience phenomenally.  \n\n2. It avoids global scepticism about ordinary perceptual and inferential beliefs.  \n\n3. It accommodates a layered conception of epistemic normativity: minimal justification through reliable sub-personal basing; stronger goods (understanding, capacity for articulation) through reflective access.  \n\n4. It offers a principled distinction between legitimate automatic processes (perception, language processing, expert intuition) and deviant ones (hypnosis, wishful thinking) by invoking the *recoverability* condition.  \n\nIf the argument is sound, the burden shifts. Those who insist on conscious awareness must explain why, in the face of the five cases and the two-tier model, we should accept a requirement that entails widespread scepticism and conflicts with our best cognitive science. Until such an account is offered, we are licensed to believe that the lights can be on epistemically even when consciousness is partially, or momentarily, in the dark.", "output_tokens": 3103, "reasoning_tokens": 384}

Introduction and Thesis  \n\nWhen I glance at the sky and judge that a storm is coming, I do not explicitly rehearse the dark hue of the clouds, the humidity on my skin, and the sudden stillness of the air. Yet the perceptual features that caused my belief also seem to be the reasons on which that belief is epistemically based. Does the fact that I was not consciously aware of those reasons at the moment of judgment deprive the belief of its justificatory pedigree?  \n\nI shall argue that occurrent, first-personal awareness of one\u2019s reasons is not required for a mental state to be epistemically based on those reasons. What is required is that (i) the reasons stand in the right kind of counterfactual, non-deviant explanatory relation to the belief (they are what the belief is \u201cfor\u201d from within the subject\u2019s cognitive economy) and (ii) the subject has a standing capacity to bring those reasons under conscious scrutiny when the need for reflective assessment arises. Call this the Potential Uptake Account. It preserves the intuition that epistemic reasons must be in some sense \u201cavailable to the subject\u201d while still making room for the justificatory force of modular, automatic, or even sub-personal processes.  \n\nThe argument proceeds as follows. Section 2 clarifies the distinction between causal and epistemic basing. Section 3 lays out the Conscious Awareness Requirement (CAR) and the motivations for it. Section 4 presents four problem cases for CAR. Section 5 develops the Potential Uptake Account and shows how it handles those cases. Section 6 replies to two major objections. Section 7 concludes by situating the view within the broader internalism/externalism debate.  \n\n2. Causal vs. Epistemic Basing  \n\nA belief can be *caused* by some state of affairs without being *based* on it in the epistemic sense. Suppose a hypnotist says the word \u201cblue,\u201d thereby causing me to believe the stock market will rise. The acoustic stimulus is a cause, but not a reason. To capture the difference we need three ingredients.  \n\na. Direction of fit. Reasons aim to *justify*; causes need not.  \nb. Non-deviance. The connection must be of the right kind\u2014roughly, the normal operation of mechanisms aimed at truth.  \nc. Cognitive integration. The putative reasons must belong to the subject\u2019s reasoning system rather than bypass it (as in the hypnotist case).  \n\nThese constraints leave open whether conscious awareness is required. CAR claims it is.  \n\n3. The Conscious Awareness Requirement (CAR)  \n\nCAR: S\u2019s mental state M is epistemically based on reason R only if S is consciously aware of R (or of some representation of R) at the time M is formed or sustained.  \n\nWhy might one endorse CAR? Three motivations are common.  \n\nMotivation 1\u2014Transparency. Basing seems answerable to the *space of reasons*. If I cannot cite my reason, how could it truly be *my* reason?  \n\nMotivation 2\u2014Responsible Agency. Justification is linked to epistemic responsibility; responsibility, in turn, presupposes access to the grounds of one\u2019s beliefs.  \n\nMotivation 3\u2014Phenomenal Evidence. Some theories hold that the phenomenal character of perceptual experience is itself epistemic. If evidence is a matter of what it is *like* for me, then lack of awareness of that phenomenal character threatens basing.  \n\nThese motivations make CAR attractive, yet each has limits, as the following cases reveal.  \n\n4. Four Problem Cases for CAR  \n\nCase A: Routine Perception. While walking, I unreflectively believe there is a bench ahead. I do not occurrently attend to the way light patterns impact my retina, yet the perceptual information surely justifies my belief. If CAR is right, my everyday perceptual beliefs are unjustified.  \n\nCase B: Expert Automaticity. A birdwatcher glimpses a silhouette and immediately judges \u201cBlack-throated Blue Warbler.\u201d Years of training have tuned her visual module to extract diagnostic features unconsciously. With no occurrent articulation of those features, CAR implies her belief lacks a reasoned basis despite her expertise.  \n\nCase C: Memory Retrieval. I recall that the capital of Vermont is Montpelier, though I have forgotten the textbook passage from which I learned it. The testimonial evidence is not consciously available, yet it seems to remain my reason.  \n\nCase D: Child Cognition. Five-year-old Ana believes that pushing her cup will make it fall, based on rudimentary causal inferences she cannot articulate. CAR threatens to deny justification to young children across the board.  \n\nThe ubiquity of such cases suggests that CAR is too restrictive. That is not yet decisive\u2014maybe most human beliefs are unjustified!\u2014but it does put pressure on CAR to do explanatory work that matches our intuitions.  \n\n5. The Potential Uptake Account  \n\nI propose that epistemic basing consists in a *potential for conscious uptak*e rather than occurrent awareness. Formally:  \n\nPUA: M is epistemically based on R for S iff  \n(1) R non-deviantly causes M via mechanisms whose *functional role* is to respond to reasons, and  \n(2) Were S to enter a context of reflective scrutiny\u2014prompted by challenge, doubt, or inquiry\u2014those very mechanisms would make R (or a suitable surrogate) accessible to S\u2019s consciousness as the basis for M.  \n\nCondition (1) secures the truth-aiming etiology; condition (2) secures the agency and responsibility intuitions. Let us see how PUA handles the earlier cases.  \n\nRoutine Perception. The perceptual module is reason-responsive: it encodes features bearing on truth (luminance, depth cues, etc.). Were I to wonder whether there is really a bench, a quick glance or mental replay would surface those features, satisfying (2).  \n\nExpert Automaticity. The birder\u2019s visual system registers the warbler\u2019s wing bars and tail contrast. If asked, she can slow down, point to the diagnostic features, and justify her belief. That dispositional accessibility suffices.  \n\nMemory Retrieval. Although I cannot recall the original testimonial chain, I can recall that I learned it from a reliable source. When pressed, I can say, \u201cI was taught that in school and have never encountered any contrary evidence.\u201d The underlying memory network would deliver enough content for uptake.  \n\nChild Cognition. Ana may not cite *laws of physics*, but her cognitive system represents regularities of support and motion. If challenged, she can produce behaviorally available surrogates: \u201cWhen you push things, they fall.\u201d That meets (2) at a developmentally appropriate granularity.  \n\nHence PUA vindicates the intuitive judgments while rejecting CAR.  \n\n6. Replies to Two Objections  \n\nObjection 1: Availability is Cheap. Won\u2019t any causal base count as \u2018potentially accessible\u2019 given enough prompting? Suppose the hypnotist earlier implanted the stock-market belief. If I later undergo regression therapy, I might recall the hypnotic session. Does PUA mistakenly confer justification?  \n\nReply. Condition (1) restricts the causal pathway to *reason-responsive mechanisms*. The hypnotic trigger bypasses the epistemic system; it is akin to electro-stimulation of motor cortex causing my arm to rise\u2014not an action for which I am responsible. Because the belief-forming pathway is not designed to track truth, the hypnotic cause fails (1), regardless of later recollection.  \n\nObjection 2: Circularity. PUA appeals to \u2018mechanisms whose functional role is to respond to reasons.\u2019 But whether a process is reason-responsive seems itself an epistemic matter. Isn\u2019t the account circular?  \n\nReply. Functional role can be specified in non-epistemic computational terms: the process takes informational inputs that covary with world states and yields outputs that better than chance co-vary with those states across normal environments. This naturalistic proxy for truth-aiming avoids circularity while capturing the core of epistemic functionality.  \n\n7. Relation to Internalism and Externalism  \n\nCAR is a form of *access internalism*: justification supervenes on what is introspectively available now. PUA is a hybrid. Condition (1) is externalist, requiring the right causal etiology, while (2) is internalist, demanding potential access. The view thereby explains why classic externalisms (reliabilism) feel too detached from agency, and pure internalisms too restrictive.  \n\nSome will complain that hybrid theories are unstable compromises. Yet PUA is principled: epistemic justification is for thinkers who can *learn* and *correct* themselves. Dispositional accessibility is what makes reasons usable for future inquiry, meeting the deontic dimension without over-intellectualizing everyday cognition.  \n\n8. Conclusion  \n\nConscious occurrent awareness is not a prerequisite for epistemic basing. What matters is that the subject\u2019s cognitive architecture treats certain states as reason-giving and can, when circumstances demand, elevate them into the space of reasons. The Potential Uptake Account captures this insight, rescuing ordinary perception, expert automaticity, memory, and child cognition from skeptical threat while preserving the central intuition that reasons must in some sense be *one\u2019s own*.  \n\nApproximately 1,940 words.", "output_tokens": 2316, "reasoning_tokens": 320}

Orientation and Thesis  \n\nA familiar, venerable thought in epistemology holds that if a belief counts as epistemically justified for a subject, that subject must in some sense \u201cbase\u201d the belief on the reasons that render it justified.  A still more demanding proposal says that basing requires the *conscious* appreciation of those reasons: unless I can tell (at least to myself) why I believe p, the belief is not genuinely *my* epistemic achievement.  On this view, the deliverances of automatic, modular, or otherwise unconscious cognitive routines\u2014paradigmatically perception and linguistic processing\u2014could never be epistemically credit-conferring in their own right; at best they supply raw causal antecedents to which one later \u201cadds\u201d justification by bringing the supporting considerations to consciousness.\n\nI shall argue that the requirement is too strong.  Conscious awareness of one\u2019s reasons is *sufficient* for epistemic basing, but not *necessary*.  What *is* necessary is that the relevant subpersonally represented information (i) be the kind of content that *would* justify the attitude if it were raised to consciousness, and (ii) figure in a suitably \u201creasons-responsive\u201d causal pathway that is properly attributable to the subject\u2019s cognitive agency.  Call this the *Accessibility-Plus-Control* account.  The upshot is that modular, automatic processes can generate attitudes that are justified in virtue of the epistemic credentials of the (unconsciously) tokened representations on which they are based.  \n\nMy case proceeds in four stages.  Section 2 disentangles three senses of \u201cawareness\u201d and \u201cbasing.\u201d  Section 3 canvasses the main arguments for the awareness requirement and diagnoses where they overreach.  Section 4 develops the positive Accessibility-Plus-Control account, drawing on empirical and philosophical considerations.  Section 5 replies to five objections\u2014concerning epistemic responsibility, the problem of deviant causation, blind-sighted reliability, bootstrapping worries, and cases of pathological implicit bias.  Section 6 concludes by locating the proposal in the broader internalism\u2013externalism landscape.\n\nIf successful, the discussion shows that the phenomenology of reasoning, while epistemically important, does not set the boundary of epistemic basing.  The mind\u2019s backstage labor can itself be a rational engine.\n\n2. Distinctions: Awareness, Basing, and Agency  \n\n2.1 Three Grades of Awareness  \n\n(a) Phenomenal Awareness: occurrent, introspectively accessible episodes\u2014\u201cseeing\u201d the justificatory connection.  \n(b) Reflective Accessibility: the subject is not presently attending to the reason, but could bring it to conscious reflection with ordinary effort (e.g., when asked \u201cWhy do you believe that?\u201d).  \n(c) Subpersonal Representation: the information is encoded in the cognitive system in a way that guides inference or belief-formation, though it may never be accessible to consciousness (e.g., statistical priors in perceptual inference).\n\n2.2 Two Kinds of Basing  \n\n(i) Explanatory Basing: purely causal; R produces B.  \n(ii) Epistemic Basing: the causal relation counts as *reasons-responsive*\u2014the belief is *because* of the epistemic support that R provides.  This is the normative notion at issue.\n\n2.3 Agency and Control  \n\nAn attitude is credit-conferring for S only if it issues from a subsystem that is integrated with S\u2019s overall cognitive agency\u2014roughly, it must be a system S uses for forming beliefs about the world, and it must be appropriately sensitive to error signals and override mechanisms.  Mere causal production (e.g., trauma-induced aversion) is not enough.\n\nWith these distinctions in place we can now assess the awareness requirement.\n\n3. The Case *For* the Awareness Requirement  \n\nAdvocates offer three main lines of argument.\n\n3.1 The Guidance Argument  \n\nBelief-formation is an exercise of epistemic *guidance*.  I guide my doxastic conduct only if I can tell, at least in principle, what considerations I am acting on.  Otherwise the attitude is, from my reflective perspective, a black-box deliverance, more akin to a passive sensation than an achievement of rational agency.\n\n3.2 The Responsibility Argument  \n\nEpistemic justification implies *responsibility*.  One can be responsible for a belief only if one could *answer* for it.  Answerability demands the ability to cite one\u2019s reasons, hence conscious awareness.\n\n3.3 The Deviance Worry  \n\nIf a merely causal link suffices for basing, we face deviant causal chains: suppose an evil neuroscientist subliminally flashes \u201cp \u2192 q; p\u201d so that I non-consciously believe q.  Intuitively I have no justification, yet R (the premises) caused my belief.  Something like awareness seems needed to block deviance.\n\nTaken together, the arguments aim to show that phenomenal or at least reflective awareness is a necessary condition.\n\n4. Why Awareness Is Not Necessary  \n\n4.1 The Continuity of Rational Architecture  \n\nCognitive science depicts a continuum from fully conscious theorizing to fast, probabilistic inference in perception.  The same Bayesian machinery underwrites both, differing mainly in speed and encapsulation.  If rationality is a matter of *structural conformity* to good inference, it would be mysterious to draw a justificatory line at the phenomenological boundary.  \n\nConsider the ventral visual stream\u2019s estimation of 3-D shape from shading.  The system encodes the prior assumption that light comes from above; when the prior is disconfirmed, the system revises its estimate.  Ignoring conscious supervision, the process is *responsive to reasons* (here, photometric cues).  If the subject consciously performed the same Bayesian update on explicit premises, she would be praised for rational inference.  To deny justificatory status to the automatic case is to make consciousness do epistemic work for which we lack an explanatory story.\n\n4.2 The Regress Consideration  \n\nIf conscious awareness is required for each step of inference, a regress looms: for my awareness of R to justify B, must I be aware that I am aware of R, and so on?  A more plausible stopping-point is that some reason-relations can confer justification without being occurrently in view.  That suggests that what matters is the *availability* of reasons in the cognitive system, not their phenomenological presence.\n\n4.3 Responsibility Without Occurrent Awareness  \n\nMoral agency involves responsible automaticity\u2014my ingrained habit of keeping promises is praiseworthy even if I act without deliberation each time.  Analogously, epistemic responsibility can attach to well-trained inferential dispositions.  What I must be able to do, when challenged, is *audit* the process, not replicate it step by step in consciousness.\n\n4.4 Empirical Examples  \n\nCase A: Rapid linguistic comprehension.  I hear \u201cThe astronomer married the star\u201d and believe it reports a wedding, not astrophysical fusion.  The parse is driven by syntactic-semantic heuristics outside awareness but cancels if later context (\u201c\u2026achieved by gravity waves\u201d) demands it.  The belief tracks evidence and retracts under defeaters; it behaves like an epistemically based attitude.\n\nCase B: Radiologist expertise.  Veteran radiologists spot tumors \u201cat a glance,\u201d often unable initially to articulate the tell-tale patterns.  Subsequent verbalization is labored, yet their snap judgments correlate with ground truth.  Their perceptual attunement is a learned sensitivity to reasons (radiographic cues) even absent conscious articulation.\n\nCase C: Infant statistical reasoning.  Six-month-olds expect a box with mostly red balls to yield a red sample and display surprise otherwise.  They cannot articulate proportions, but their expectations respect probabilistic evidence.  Denying them epistemic standing seems parochial.\n\nTogether these cases put pressure on the phenomenological boundary.\n\n5. The Accessibility-Plus-Control Account  \n\n5.1 The Core Proposal  \n\nS\u2019s belief that p is epistemically based on R even if S lacks conscious awareness of R, provided:  \n\n(A) Subpersonal Justificatory Encoding: R is tokened *in content*\u2014not merely as a neural cause but as a representational state that bears the appropriate justificatory relation to p.  \n\n(B) Reasons-Responsive Causal Path: S\u2019s belief-forming mechanism would not have produced p in the absence of R and would have produced \u00acp given contra-evidence R*; i.e., it tracks truth via the justificatory link.  \n\n(C) Auditability: Upon reflective challenge, S retains *executive* control\u2014she can endorse, suspend, or correct the output, drawing (if needed) on further conscious reasoning.  The mechanism is integrated with higher-level monitoring.\n\nWhen all three conditions obtain, the belief is the subject\u2019s epistemic achievement even if, at the time of formation, the reasons never cross the threshold of awareness.\n\n5.2 Why the Account Blocks Deviance  \n\nIn the evil neuroscientist scenario, (B) fails: had the neuroscientist flashed random nonsense, I would still have believed q, so the pathway is not reasons-responsive.  The proposal thus explains why deviant causation does not confer justification without appealing to consciousness per se.\n\n5.3 Relation to Internalism and Externalism  \n\nAccessibility-Plus-Control occupies middle ground.  Condition (A) satisfies the internalist\u2019s insistence on representationally encoded reasons \u201cwithin the subject\u2019s perspective,\u201d while (B) and (C) embed externalist sensitivity to truth and agency.  Conscious awareness becomes one *mode* of satisfying (A)\u2013(C), not the sole mode.\n\n6. Replies to Five Objections  \n\nObjection 1: Epistemic Responsibility Revisited.  \u201cBut how can I be *responsible* for subpersonal processes I cannot inspect?\u201d\n\nReply: Responsibility attaches to dispositions I rationally maintain.  I entrust perceptual modules because I have higher-level evidence of their reliability and corrective control (closing one eye, moving closer, asking others).  Responsibility is thus *indirectly* anchored in reflective endorsement of the system, not in occurrent supervision of each inference.\n\nObjection 2: The Transparency of Reasons.  \u201cPart of what it is to count as a *reason* for me is that it strikes me as such.  Otherwise the state is just a cause.\u201d\n\nReply: The guiding intuition can be preserved by noting that qualification (A) requires representational encoding *as a telling consideration*.  For Bayesian perceptual inference, the system represents likelihoods and priors precisely in the form that would justify the updated posterior.  What makes it a *reason* is the functional role, not the phenomenology.\n\nObjection 3: Blindsight Counter-example.  In blindsight, subjects form reliable guesses without conscious experience.  Yet they lack justification.  Doesn\u2019t that show awareness is required?\n\nReply: Blindsight mechanisms violate condition (C): patients do not integrate the outputs into conscious cognitive control; they persistently deny having the relevant information.  Hence their \u201cguesses\u201d are not attributable to their epistemic agency.  The deficit is not absence of phenomenology *per se* but of the executive connectivity that underwrites auditability.\n\nObjection 4: Bootstrapping Worry.  If unconscious processes confer justification, couldn\u2019t I \u201cjustify\u201d any wild belief so long as my brain happens to encode matching data?  We lose the ability to discriminate good from bad inference.\n\nReply: Condition (B) forestalls bootstrapping.  The mechanism must be stably reasons-responsive across counterfactual scenarios.  Mere accidental correlation or one-off causal linkage will not satisfy the requirement.\n\nObjection 5: Implicit Bias as Counter-example.  Implicit racial biases operate automatically and subpersonally.  Should we therefore treat racist snap-judgments as justified?\n\nReply: No, because they fail (A) and (B).  The triggering states are not *epistemic* reasons\u2014statistical generalizations polluted by social prejudice\u2014and the mechanism is not truth-tracking.  Automaticity alone neither confers nor defeats justification; what matters is the quality of the encoded reasons and their integration with control.  Indeed, the framework explains why subjects can rightly be held epistemically *blameworthy* for biased beliefs: the mechanism is responsive to evidence (e.g., counter-stereotypical examples) and under their long-term rational control; neglecting to retrain it violates epistemic duty.\n\n7. Conscious Reflection\u2019s Residual Value  \n\nWhile awareness is not necessary, it remains epistemically valuable.  It:\n\n(i) Expands the pool of reasons that can be integrated across domains,  \n(ii) Enables second-order evaluation (spotting systematic errors), and  \n(iii) Grounds interpersonal justification\u2014offering reasons to others.  \n\nHence phenomenology plays a crucial, though not foundational, role: it is a tool for enhancing justification, not the gatekeeper of basing.\n\n8. Conclusion: Two Levels of Epistemic Life  \n\nHuman cognition operates on a layered architecture.  Subpersonal modules supply fast, probabilistic inference; conscious deliberation offers slow, cross-domain reasoning.  Epistemic virtue lies in the harmonious orchestration of both.  The Accessibility-Plus-Control account secures that harmony.  When my visual system non-consciously aggregates cues to deliver the belief \u201cThere\u2019s a desk before me,\u201d and I stand ready to check, correct, or explain that verdict, the belief is no less epistemically based for having originated in cognitive darkness.\n\nTherefore, lack of conscious awareness does *not* preclude a mental state from being epistemically based on the reasons that subserve it.  What matters is the reasons\u2019 presence in the agent\u2019s cognitive economy in a form that guides belief in a reasons-responsive, agency-integrated way.  Conscious light can illuminate our reasons; it need not create them.", "output_tokens": 3340, "reasoning_tokens": 384}

Orienting the Issue  \n\nWhen I open my eyes and form the belief that there is a red coffee mug on the desk, I rarely advert, in consciousness, to anything I would call \u201cmy reasons.\u201d The perceptual system delivers the representation automatically; I am struck by the mug\u2019s presence, not by the evidential support for believing in it. Yet nearly every epistemological theory treats such perceptual beliefs as paradigmatically justified. How, then, should we evaluate the claim\u2014advanced by some advocates of access\u2010internalism and of \u201cresponsibilist\u201d epistemology\u2014that a mental state is epistemically based on reasons only if the subject is consciously aware of those reasons? I will argue that lack of occurrent awareness does not preclude genuine epistemic basing, although dispositions for reflective awareness play an important downstream role. To make that case, I distinguish five things often run together: (i) the metaphysical basing relation, (ii) epistemic justification, (iii) epistemic responsibility, (iv) reflective endorsement, and (v) rational self\u2010assessment. Once these pieces are separated, we see that subpersonal, modular, and automatic processes can ground epistemic basing even in the absence of conscious access, while responsibility and self\u2010assessment depend on further conditions.\n\n2. Why Some Think Awareness is Needed  \n\nTwo families of argument drive the awareness requirement.\n\nA. The Responsibility Argument  \n1. A belief is justified only if the subject is epistemically responsible for holding it.  \n2. Responsibility entails the ability to cite or evaluate one\u2019s reasons.  \n3. Ability to cite or evaluate reasons requires conscious awareness of them.  \nTherefore, justified belief requires awareness of one\u2019s reasons.\n\nB. The Guidance\u2010Control Argument  \nEpistemic agency is analogous to practical agency: what merits credit is that which is under the agent\u2019s guidance\u2010control. Guidance requires reasons that are available in consciousness, otherwise the process is merely causal, like a reflex.\n\nIf either argument succeeds, subpersonal processes confer, at best, animal\u2010level reliability, not genuine epistemic standing. I contend that both arguments overextend the concept of responsibility and misconstrue the locus of epistemic credit.\n\n3. Distinguishing Four Kinds of \u2018Reason\u2019  \n\nThe debate is muddied by equivocation on \u201creason.\u201d We need four contrasts.\n\ni. Normative vs. Motivating Reasons  \nA normative reason is a fact that counts in favor of a proposition\u2019s truth. A motivating reason is the consideration that actually moves a subject to believe. Normative reasons need not be mentally represented; motivating reasons must be.\n\nii. Personal\u2010Level vs. Subpersonal\u2010Level Reasons  \nPersonal\u2010level reasons are those to which the agent could, in principle, have access through introspection or reflection. Subpersonal reasons are information\u2010bearing states within specialized modules\u2014edge detectors in vision, syntactic parsers in language\u2014that play a justificatory role without being accessible.\n\niii. Occurrent vs. Dispositional Awareness  \nI might not now be consciously aware that \u201cthere is a red surface in front of me,\u201d but with minimal prompting I can avow that as my reason. Awareness can therefore be standing rather than currently entertained.\n\niv. Justificatory vs. Explanatory Basing  \nThe explanatory base of a belief is the causal chain that produced it; the justificatory base is that subset of the chain that also provides epistemic support. Only the latter is relevant to epistemic status.\n\nArmed with these distinctions, we can ask a cleaner question: Does a belief that is produced by subpersonal processes whose representational content is not consciously accessible nevertheless stand in the justificatory basing relation to the content of those states? I answer: yes, provided the process is of the right epistemic type.\n\n4. The Case from Perception and Memory  \n\nPerceptual belief is the paradigmatic counterexample to the awareness criterion. Consider three cases:\n\n(i) Standard Vision: Anne looks at a tomato and believes it is red. She has no occurrent awareness of the low\u2010level luminance gradients that function as her evidence.  \n(ii) Blindsight: Bob has damage in area V1; he denies seeing anything but guesses correctly where a light flashes. Bob lacks conscious experience, yet his guesses are reliably based on visual information.  \n(iii) Change Blindness: Claire stares at a scene in which a large object is replaced in a flicker paradigm. She remains unaware of the change, though her eyes and early visual system registered it.\n\nAnne\u2019s belief is justified, Bob\u2019s guesses are at least prima facie justified (though fragile), and Claire\u2019s failure to notice the change is not blamed on irresponsibility; it is a limitation of normal cognition. These cases suggest that epistemic basing can occur in virtue of sub\u2010personal information processing, independent of awareness.\n\n5. A Competence\u2010Based Account of Basing  \n\nMy positive proposal is a competence model, integrating insights from virtue epistemology and etiological accounts of normativity.\n\nThesis: A mental state M is epistemically based on reason\u2010bearing state R for subject S iff (i) R causally produces M via S\u2019s epistemic competence C, (ii) C is a disposition that functions to produce truth in the relevant environment, and (iii) R is the content that C is designed to track.\n\nCompetence C can be implemented subpersonally; what matters is that it is the agent\u2019s competence, constitutive of her cognitive architecture. Epistemic basing, on this view, is analogous to a skilled archer\u2019s shot being guided by proprioceptive feedback she cannot articulate. Credit accrues because the shot issues from her competence, not because she can cite the micro\u2010corrections that served as her reasons.\n\n6. Why Responsibility Does Not Require Occurrent Awareness  \n\nResponsibility in ordinary moral contexts does not require contemporaneous, explicit reasoning. We laud the driver who reflexively brakes to avoid a child; we do not demand that she consciously computed stopping distances. Likewise, epistemic responsibility is anchored in the possession and proper deployment of competences. When things go well, the agent deserves credit even without occurrent reflection; when they go badly, criticism is warranted only if the agent failed to maintain competences she could reasonably sustain (e.g., ignored contrary evidence she might easily have noticed).\n\nThis view preserves a role for awareness: reflective endorsement is the mechanism by which agents monitor and repair their epistemic competences. But it is not a prerequisite for every justified belief. The awareness requirement mistakes the means of second\u2010order monitoring for the first\u2010order basis of justification.\n\n7. Objections and Replies  \n\nObjection 1 (The Alien Implant): Suppose my belief that p is produced by an alien chip that reliably stimulates the relevant neural pattern. I lack awareness of its operation. Yet by the competence account, p seems justified. Intuitively, it is not.  \nReply: The chip is not integrated into the agent\u2019s epistemic competences; it bypasses them. Clause (i) of the competence model requires production via the subject\u2019s own competences, not any reliable cause.\n\nObjection 2 (Meta\u2010Inaccessibility): If the reasons are meta\u2010inaccessible, the subject cannot tell whether she is hallucinating or seeing. Doesn\u2019t that undermine justification?  \nReply: The inability to *distinguish* between good and bad cases does not entail that the good case lacks justification. New Evil Demon scenarios teach us that internal similarity suffices for justification. All that is required is that, in the actual world, the competence functions properly.\n\nObjection 3 (No Guidance): Without awareness, there is no guidance; the process is merely a causal pipeline.  \nReply: Control can be subpersonal. A skilled pianist executes arpeggios faster than conscious monitoring allows, yet we credit her. Guidance is exhibited by the system\u2019s capacity to correct errors and to integrate with higher\u2010level goals; both occur below the threshold of attention.\n\n8. Why Not Downgrade Basing to the Dispositional Level?  \n\nA popular fallback is to say that what is necessary is not occurrent but dispositional awareness: the agent could, upon reflection, cite her reasons. I accept a *limited* version: for many human beliefs, such ability is present and contributes to epistemic virtue. But two points caution against enshrining it as necessary.\n\nFirst, animals and preverbal children form perceptual beliefs that we deem epistemically good, though they lack the capacity to cite reasons even dispositionally. Second, sophisticated cognitive science shows that the lion\u2019s share of our belief formation depends on processes whose data are *never* available to consciousness\u2014feature maps, Bayesian weighting, and unconscious inference. Making \u201cavailability to reflection\u201d a condition on epistemic basing would falsely classify most human cognition as unjustified.\n\n9. A Division of Epistemic Labor  \n\nThe competence account thus supports a division of epistemic labor.\n\nLevel 1: Subpersonal competences generate beliefs from information (reasons) they internally represent.  \nLevel 2: Personal\u2010level awareness allows monitoring, criticism, and higher\u2010order justification (e.g., inferential beliefs, theoretical reasoning).  \nLevel 3: Collective\u2010level processes (peer review, testimony) further scaffold justification.\n\nOnly at Level 2 does conscious awareness become central; Level 1 already carries an irreducible portion of epistemic basing.\n\n10. Implications for Modular and Automatic Processes  \n\nConsider fast\u2010and\u2010frugal heuristics studied by Gigerenzer, or the face\u2010recognition module that yields the belief \u201cThat\u2019s Jane.\u201d If these heuristics are statistically tuned to the environment, their outputs are justified absent defeaters, even though the subject lacks access to the cue\u2010weighting matrices. Epistemic evaluation attaches to the *design* of the module, much as the reliability of a measuring instrument attaches to its calibration. Human cognitive architecture is itself one of our \u201cinstruments.\u201d\n\nAutomaticity therefore poses no general threat to epistemic basing; the threat arises only when automation is *maladaptive* (as with implicit racial bias). Here, personal\u2010level reflection is crucial, not to supply first\u2010order justification, but to identify and correct malfunctioning competences. The awareness requirement is reinterpreted as a *regulative* norm: be in a position to notice when your own cognitive instruments misfire.\n\n11. An Illustrative Example: Chicken Sexers  \n\nOld\u2010school chicken sexers can identify the sex of a day\u2010old chick at 90% accuracy but cannot articulate how. Their judgments are justified: they possess a skill attuned to subtle visual cues serving as reasons, though inaccessible. The training process inculcates the competence; the resulting judgments exemplify epistemic basing without conscious awareness. What they lack is the capacity to *teach* the method verbally, not the epistemic status of their beliefs. The case vividly underscores the gap between knowing\u2010that and knowing\u2010why.\n\n12. Residual Worries: Epistemic Luck and Error Cases  \n\nDoes subpersonal basing invite epistemic luck? Suppose a normally reliable module is temporarily disoriented by fog yet still by chance yields a true belief. The competence account copes by building in a performance condition: justification obtains only when the competence functions properly in *normal* conditions. If environmental degradation defeats the competence, justification lapses\u2014even if, fortuitously, the belief is true. Awareness is irrelevant to this luck\u2010blocking condition.\n\n13. Bringing It Together  \n\nWe can now answer the guiding question.\n\n1. A mental state can be epistemically based on reasons that are encoded only subpersonally.  \n2. Conscious awareness is neither metaphysically nor normatively necessary for first\u2010order justification.  \n3. Awareness has a crucial but derivative role: it underwrites higher\u2010order epistemic responsibilities\u2014calibration, error correction, intellectual virtue.  \n4. Therefore, automatic, modular processes are legitimate carriers of epistemic basing, provided they are integrated into the subject\u2019s competences and function properly in the environment.\n\n14. Concluding Synthesis  \n\nPhilosophical pressure for the awareness requirement springs from conflating justification with the capacity to *defend* or *explain* one\u2019s beliefs. Yet the latter is a second\u2010order virtue. Justification proper happens wherever the world\u2019s informational structure is suitably registered by the subject\u2019s cognitive architecture\u2014whether or not that registration surfaces in consciousness. By acknowledging this layered picture, we do justice to two seemingly opposed intuitions: (a) that perceptual and other automatic beliefs are often justified, and (b) that reflective awareness is integral to responsible inquiry. The result is an epistemology that is both psycholog\u00adically realistic and normatively demanding\u2014without insisting that the light of reason must illuminate every corner of the mind for knowledge to dawn.", "output_tokens": 3006, "reasoning_tokens": 384}

Introduction and Thesis\n\nWhen I avert my eyes from the road and automatically swerve to avoid a stray dog, none of the reasons that led me to turn the wheel\u2014knowledge of canine fragility, a general aversion to harming living things, a standing desire to keep my car undamaged\u2014were occurrently in consciousness. Still, it would be odd to say my maneuver was epistemically baseless, on a par with a mere twitch. What seems right is that I had the right reasons, even though they never became the focus of attention.  \n\nThis intuitive verdict conflicts with a prominent \u201cawareness requirement.\u201d According to that requirement, a person\u2019s mental state (belief, intention, perceptual judgment, etc.) is justified or rational only if she is consciously aware of the reasons on which it is based\u2014perhaps by entertaining them as premises, perhaps by having them \u201cbefore the mind\u201d in a felt way. The demand is advanced by some access\u2010internalists (e.g., BonJour 1998, Fumerton 2001) and by recent agency\u2010driven accounts of basing (e.g., Lord 2021, Littlejohn 2020). These philosophers worry that unless reasons are consciously accessible, the state is just the upshot of a subpersonal mechanism, devoid of epistemic credit.  \n\nMy thesis is that lack of conscious awareness does not, in general, preclude a mental state from being epistemically based on the reasons that in fact support it. Conscious access may be important for certain grades of epistemic standing\u2014reflective justification, second\u2010order knowledge that one knows\u2014but not for the primitive basing relation that grounds first\u2010order justification. I defend a \u201cfunctional accessibility\u201d model: R bases belief B in subject S just in case (i) R is a contentful state in S\u2019s cognitive architecture, (ii) R non\u2010deviantly causes or sustains B in virtue of its content, and (iii) R is poised\u2014should circumstances of reflection arise\u2014to be retrieved and deployed in conscious reasoning. Conscious awareness is sufficient but not necessary\u2014a dispositional capacity to bring reasons to consciousness suffices.  \n\nThe discussion proceeds in four stages. Section 2 clarifies the target claim and distinguishes basing, having a reason, and being justified. Section 3 presents three lines of argument for the awareness requirement and diagnoses their weaknesses. Section 4 develops the functional accessibility account and shows how it handles cases of modular or automatic cognition. Section 5 replies to residual objections and draws implications for epistemic agency.\n\n2. Clarifying the Terrain\n\n2.1 Basing vs. Possessing Reasons  \nA person can have a reason R in her belief\u2010set without B being based on R. I believe the barometer has dropped and I believe a storm is coming; but if the causal route from the first belief to the second runs through wishful thinking rather than meteorological inference, the belief is not based on the barometer reading even though that reading is among my stored propositions.\n\n2.2 Justification vs. Basing  \nMany reliabilists hold that a belief may be justified (in virtue of arising from a reliable process) even if it is not based on the subject\u2019s own reasons. The awareness theorist\u2019s focus is narrower: she targets the basing relation itself, not every route to justification. The question, then, is whether awareness is necessary to differentiate \u201cgood\u201d from \u201cdeviant\u201d causation when R actually does sustain B.\n\n2.3 Grades of Awareness  \nAwareness has at least three grades:  \nA) Phenomenal consciousness: R\u2019s content figures in current phenomenal experience.  \nB) Access consciousness: R is available for report and deliberate control, though not presently attended to.  \nC) Dispositional availability: R could be brought under access consciousness through ordinary reflective effort.\n\nThe awareness requirement, as defended by its proponents, typically points to (A) or (B). My functional accessibility model aligns basing with (C).\n\n3. Arguments for the Awareness Requirement\n\n3.1 The Credit Argument  \nEpistemic credit, some say, belongs to the agent only if she guided herself by reasons she appreciated. Suppose a clairvoyant unknowingly forms true beliefs via an unreliable faculty. Lacking awareness of any reasons, her true beliefs are not creditable. From this, the awareness theorist generalizes: genuine basing always requires conscious appreciation.\n\nDiagnosis. The inference is hasty. The clairvoyant lacks not merely awareness of reasons but the reasons themselves\u2014her faculty delivers beliefs without evidence. By contrast, automatic perceptual judgments are delivered by mechanisms that encode and deploy rich informational states (edge detection, motion parallax, etc.) that truly support the judgments. The presence of reasons, not their occurrent appreciation, secures credit. Skillful action offers an analogy: the pianist merits praise for her effortless arpeggios even if she could not articulate every micro\u2010movement; what matters is that the execution flows from her trained capacities, which are attributively hers.\n\n3.2 The Control Argument  \nBeing rational requires guidance by norm\u2010responsive control. If reasons are subpersonal, they cannot be integrated into the agent\u2019s rational control system; hence no basing.\n\nDiagnosis. Cognitive science draws the agent/subpersonal line differently. Much \u201cSystem 1\u201d processing, though fast and automatic, is sensitive to informational inputs in norm\u2010governed ways. Witness Bayesian perceptual cue integration: the brain weights cues by their reliability. Such probabilistic tuning is part of the agent\u2019s control system, just at a non\u2010conscious level. Control, therefore, does not entail consciousness; it entails the right kind of informational sensitivity.\n\n3.3 The Introspective Test  \nAsk the subject \u201cWhy do you believe p?\u201d If she cannot cite R, that shows p is not based on R. Introspective accessibility seems built into the concept of basing.\n\nDiagnosis. Two fallacies lurk. First, basing is synchronic; interrogation is diachronic. A belief might be well\u2010based at t\u2080 though the subject forgets the supporting considerations at t\u2081. Second, people often have poor self\u2010knowledge of their evidential motives (Nisbett & Wilson 1977). If their inability to articulate reasons nullified basing, most of our everyday reasoning would be irrational. The introspection test is defeasible evidence at best.\n\n4. The Functional Accessibility Account\n\n4.1 Core Idea  \nA mental state R bases belief B for S when:\n\n(i) Content\u2010Causation: R\u2019s content non\u2010deviantly causes B. If R were absent or had different content, B would differ accordingly.  \n(ii) Integration: R is stored within S\u2019s personal\u2010level cognitive architecture (not merely in environmental scaffolding).  \n(iii) Accessibility Condition: S is in principle able, through normal reflective routes, to become aware of R and to use it in explicit reasoning.\n\n4.2 Why Condition (iii)?  \nWe need (iii) to safeguard against deviant causal coincidences (e.g., a brain lesion that both implants B and separately produces R). If the causal route does not pass through pathways that make R retrievable, R is not the agent\u2019s reason. But (iii) is weaker than the awareness requirement: R must be available, not occurrent.\n\n4.3 Automatic Inference Cases\n\nCase 1: Face recognition. You glance at a stranger and believe \u201cHe\u2019s angry.\u201d The visual system computes features (furrowed brow, tightened lips) and, drawing on learned associations, outputs the categorical judgment. You cannot list the micro\u2010features, but given training in emotion recognition you could come to articulate some of them. Conditions (i)\u2013(iii) are met: the features causally ground the judgment, reside in your visual memory, and are accessible to reflection. The belief is based on reasons you are not yet aware of.\n\nCase 2: Expert chess move. A grandmaster \u201cjust sees\u201d that Qe4 is best. Eye\u2010tracking shows her gaze lingers on threatened squares; her pattern\u2010recognition modules crunch tactical motifs. She later justifies the move verbally upon demand. Again, the reasons were available but not consciously front\u2010and\u2010center during decision.\n\n4.4 Blind\u2010Sight and the Limit Case  \nWhy not say the blindsight subject\u2019s guess is based on reasons? Because Condition (iii) fails. Although subpersonal states convey information about stimuli, the subject cannot\u2014without prompting that bypasses the damaged V1 route\u2014bring those states under conscious scrutiny. Hence the informational states are not functionally accessible in the relevant sense; they are encapsulated from personal\u2010level cognition. The model thus preserves the intuition that blindsight lacks epistemic basing.\n\n5. Objections and Replies\n\nObjection 1: The model trivializes basing; any reliable causal chain will satisfy (i)\u2013(iii).  \nReply: Reliability without content\u2010sensitive causation or accessibility does not meet (iii). Consider an AI chip surreptitiously implanted in my skull that outputs stock tips. The data flow is not stored within my cognitive architecture; I cannot retrieve or manipulate it. So condition (ii) fails. The account is stricter than bare reliabilism.\n\nObjection 2: Reflective equilibrium demands more. Unless the subject actually endorses R, she cannot rationally integrate new evidence that bears on R.  \nReply: Actual endorsement is necessary for some higher\u2010order norms (\u201cbe able to defend your beliefs\u201d), but first\u2010order justification precedes such reflection. Infants, animals, and distracted adults still form perceptual beliefs that are prima facie justified, even if they lack the metacognitive prowess to endorse reasons.\n\nObjection 3: The awareness requirement explains over\u2010rationalization; people confabulate reasons because they sense a normative pressure to be aware.  \nReply: Confabulation shows that people mistake the conditions of rationality; it does not show the mistake is correct. Indeed, they confabulate precisely because the real subpersonal reasons are unreportable, yet efficacious. Functional accessibility places the reasons within the agent; confabulation arises when accessibility is impeded or memory is degraded, not because basing always demands current awareness.\n\n6. Epistemic Agency Revisited\n\nOn the proposed view, epistemic agency operates on two levels.\n\nTier 1: Sub\u2010reflective agency. Here, perception, memory, and inference run automatically but in ways that track evidence. Justification accrues as long as the cognitive system is properly calibrated.  \n\nTier 2: Reflective agency. When time and attention permit, we audit our Tier-1 outputs, integrating them, revising them, or discarding them. Conscious awareness of reasons enhances agency, enabling deliberate reasoning, but Tier-1 agency already earns a kind of credit: the credit due a well\u2010trained, responsible cognitive system.\n\nThis two\u2010tier picture aligns with empirical findings (dual\u2010process theory), with virtue epistemology (where well\u2010functioning capacities ground credit), and with ordinary practice (praise the doctor for a swift, intuitive diagnosis, yet still expect a reasoned explanation on request).\n\n7. Conclusion\n\nThe awareness requirement overplays the role of consciousness in grounding epistemic basing. While conscious access is pivotal for reflective knowledge, the primitive basing relation is secured whenever reasons are functionally accessible\u2014integrated into the agent\u2019s cognitive system and causally responsible for her belief. Modular, automatic processes therefore can, and often do, provide genuine epistemic grounding. The upshot is a more ecologically realistic epistemology, one that recognizes human reasoning for what it largely is: fast, frugal, and mostly invisible to introspection, yet nonetheless rational in virtue of the reasons silently doing their work beneath the limelight of consciousness.", "output_tokens": 2903, "reasoning_tokens": 448}

Framing the Problem  \n\nThe contemporary debate about epistemic basing is pulled between two desiderata. On the one hand, we want an account on which the justification of my beliefs is creditable to me; epistemic status should not be a mere accident of brain chemistry but something for which I can, in principle, be held responsible. That impulse tempts us toward a \u201cconscious-awareness requirement\u201d: my belief that p is justified by reason R only if I consciously entertain (or at least can consciously recall) R as my reason. On the other hand, cognitive science stresses that most ordinary belief-formation is automatic, modular, and largely inaccessible to introspection. If conscious awareness were strictly required, it would follow that the lion\u2019s share of human (and animal) cognition is epistemically blind\u2014an unpalatable conclusion.  \n\nThesis.  Lack of occurrent conscious awareness of reasons does not in itself bar a mental state from being epistemically based on those reasons. What epistemic basing requires is that the subject\u2019s cognitive system deploy the reasons in a way that is (i) counterfactually sensitive to their truth-makers and (ii) suitably available for personal-level endorsement under normal conditions of reflection. Conscious access can play a facilitating role, but it is neither necessary nor sufficient for genuine basing.\n\nI defend that claim in five steps. (1) I clarify the target: \u201cconscious awareness,\u201d \u201creasons,\u201d and \u201cbasing.\u201d (2) I present the strongest case for the awareness requirement, drawn from responsibility, transparency, and deference considerations. (3) I show that each argument overgeneralises once we examine uncontroversial cases of justified automatic inference. (4) I develop a dispositional-accessibility model that preserves the agentive element without demanding occurrent consciousness. (5) I answer three residual objections and draw broader implications for epistemology and the philosophy of cognitive science.\n\n2. Three Crucial Distinctions  \n\n2.1 Occurrent vs. dispositional awareness. One can have a reason \u201cbefore the mind\u201d (currently entertaining it), one can have the capacity to recall it given minimal reflection (dispositional awareness), or one can lack even that capacity. The awareness requirement as commonly pressed is specifically about occurrent awareness.\n\n2.2 Personal-level vs. subpersonal processes. An inference is personal-level when the subject, not merely a subsystem, is the functional \u201cconsumer\u201d of the content. The oculomotor system that triggers a saccade is subpersonal; the recognition that a student in the back has raised her hand is personal. Many automatic inferences\u2014e.g., grammatical parsing\u2014are personal-level even though they are not consciously controlled.\n\n2.3 Guiding vs. merely causing. For R to function as my reason for believing p, the presence of R must guide the formation or maintenance of the belief, not merely cause it in some deviant way. The basing relation is therefore a norm-governed causal relation.\n\n3. The Best Case for a Conscious-Awareness Requirement  \n\n3.1 Responsibility. We praise or blame agents only for what they do knowingly. If epistemic evaluation is a species of normative appraisal, justified belief must be one for which the subject knowingly relies on the appropriate reasons.\n\n3.2 Transparency. One distinctive feature of epistemic reasons is that we can answer the transparency question: \u201cWhy do you believe that p?\u201d If I cannot cite any reason, arguably my belief floats free of epistemic moorings.\n\n3.3 Deference. Epistemic rationality involves deference to one\u2019s reasons: I form a belief because the reasons support it, not vice-versa. But if the reasons never even appear in consciousness, deference seems impossible; the dependence relation is hidden behind cognitive black boxes.\n\n4. Why the Case Overgeneralises  \n\n4.1 Ubiquity of Unconscious Yet Justified Inference.  \n\nVisual shape constancy: I judge the door is rectangular despite its retinal image being trapezoidal. The shape-from-shading modules integrate depth cues and project a 3-D model; I am utterly unaware of the geometrical reasons exploited, yet few would say my belief is unjustified.  \n\nStatistical reasoning: Experts who can instantly tell the sex of a chick or the authorship of a painting often cannot articulate the features on which they rely. Psychologists call this \u201cexpert intuition,\u201d and it reliably outperforms conscious novices. If the awareness requirement were strict, we would have to deny that such expertise produces knowledge.  \n\n4.2 Confabulation and the Argument from Sufficiency. Conscious avowal is frequently too cheap. Split-brain and priming experiments show that subjects will produce post-hoc \u201creasons\u201d that are unrelated to the actual causal basis of their choices. If mere consciousness sufficed for basing, these confabulated reasons would count. So consciousness is not sufficient; that casts doubt on its necessity.\n\n4.3 Skill Analogy. In ethics we happily credit an agent for skilled automatic action\u2014e.g. the pianist\u2019s arpeggio\u2014even though she is not consciously aware of the micro-movements guiding her fingers. The epistemic analogue is the expert whose reasoning is automatic yet trained. Responsibility can extend to the cultivated dispositions even when moment-to-moment awareness is absent.\n\n5. A Dispositional-Accessibility Account  \n\nCore idea: For a belief B to be based on reason R, the agent must possess a competence C such that:\n\n(Comp1) C token-processes input R into output B in normal conditions.\n\n(Comp2) If the agent were to reflect under conditions conducive to epistemic self-assessment\u2014no time pressure, no drugs interfering with working memory\u2014she would be able to cite R (perhaps after some search) as what justifies B.\n\n(Comp3) The process instantiating C is counterfactually sensitive to the truth-makers of R: were R false or unreliable, C would, with high probability, refrain from outputting B.\n\nThis view borrows from internalist \u201cevidence access\u201d and externalist \u201cproper function.\u201d Consciousness drops out as a necessary condition; what matters is integration within the subject\u2019s epistemic agency. Let me show how the account handles the earlier desiderata.\n\n5.1 Responsibility. The subject is evaluatively responsible because C is her competence\u2014formed through learning and open to critical scrutiny. She can, if prompted, examine and amend C. That satisfies the moral analogue: I am responsible for my driving even when I change gears automatically.\n\n5.2 Transparency. Although she may initially shrug when asked for reasons, under Comp2 the reflectively idealised subject can retrieve them. Transparency is thus preserved in principle, though not necessarily in every conversational context.\n\n5.3 Deference. The guidance condition (Comp1) ensures that R, not some deviant cause, controls the belief-forming process. Conscious appreciation is one but not the only way that guidance can be realised.\n\n6. Objections and Replies  \n\nObjection 1: Epistemic evaluation is moment-sensitive. At t1 the subject believes p without conscious reasons; at t2, after reflection, she gains access to R. Our account seems to back-date justification to t1, which some find implausible.  \n\nReply. Basing is synchronic; justification is not. At t1 the competence C is already in play; what reflection adds is **recognitional justification**\u2014knowledge that one\u2019s belief is justified. Basic justification can obtain because the competence is already sensitive to R.\n\nObjection 2: What about cases of unconscious bias? A hiring manager may automatically judge a candidate unsuitable because of subliminal cues correlated with race. The competence is dispositional, accessible upon reflection, counterfactually sensitive\u2014yet wrongfully biased. Does our model wrongly count these as justified?  \n\nReply. Comp3 blocks the result. The heuristic linking race-cue to job suitability is not sensitive to truth-makers; it tracks irrelevant features. Because the process is not truth-conducive, the resulting belief fails condition Comp3.\n\nObjection 3: Animals and infants have no capacity to access reasons even dispositionally. Do they therefore lack justified belief?  \n\nReply. We can incorporate a \u201cgraded\u201d notion of basing. Minimal epistemic status\u2014call it proto-justification\u2014requires only that the belief arise from a properly functioning truth-tracking mechanism. Full-fledged justification, evaluable in normative terms, adds the dispositional-accessibility condition. Humans typically occupy the higher tier; animals the lower. The account explains why we hesitate to attribute \u201cought\u201d-level responsibility to a dog yet are comfortable saying it \u201cknows\u201d where the bone is buried.\n\n7. Comparison with Rival Accounts  \n\n7.1 Phenomenal Conception (McHugh, Lord). These views hold that justification supervenes on phenomenal character: your seeming that p provides you with conscious evidence. Our dispositional view agrees that seemings can justify but denies they are the only route. A tacit inference from \u201cthe door looks trapezoidal\u201d to \u201cthe door is rectangular\u201d is justified even when the rectangular seeming is absent (e.g., in peripheral vision).\n\n7.2 Strict Internalism (Fumerton). The Cartesian idea that justificatory relations are available \u201cby the light of reason\u201d struggles with scientific cases (e.g., statistical modeling) where the explanatory patterns are cognitively opaque. Dispositional access rescues internalist intuitions without demanding infallible self-presenting states.\n\n7.3 Pure Reliabilism. By removing any accessibility demand, pure reliabilism over-generates justification to cognitively impenetrable processes (black-box clairvoyance). Requiring Comp2 bars those cases: if I cannot in principle discover why my hunches about market fluctuations are reliable, I lack full justification even if they work by accident.\n\n8. Broader Implications  \n\n8.1 Epistemic Agency as Scaffolded. Conscious reasoning is the tip of an iceberg. Our automatic competences scaffold rational agency much like muscle memory scaffolds athletic performance. Recognising this allows epistemology to partner fruitfully with cognitive science instead of policing it.\n\n8.2 Education and Deliberate Practice. The model vindicates the pedagogical emphasis on training automaticity (e.g., in mathematics). Once a student has drilled proofs, she can leap to conclusions rapidly yet remain justified because the practice embeds an accessible rationale.\n\n8.3 Artificial Intelligence. Consider a self-explainable neural net that, when asked, can output a human-interpretable decision rule. Such a system satisfies Comp2. A black-box net that cannot expound its implicit rules does not. Thus the dispositional-accessibility test offers a principled benchmark for explainable AI.\n\n9. Conclusion  \n\nConscious awareness is epistemically significant but not mandatory for basing. What justifies a belief is not the glow of phenomenology but the integration of the operative reasons into the subject\u2019s cognitive architecture in a way that remains, in principle, transparent to her reflective capacities and that tracks the relevant truth-makers. Automatic modules can, and often do, satisfy these conditions; indeed, human knowledge would be impoverished without them. The hard work for epistemologists is therefore not to draw a bright line at consciousness, but to chart the contours of guidance, competence, and dispositional access\u2014the deeper structures that tether mind to world even when the tether is hidden from view.", "output_tokens": 2855, "reasoning_tokens": 448}

Introduction and Thesis\n\nCan a belief or other doxastic attitude be epistemically based on reasons the subject does not consciously appreciate? I argue that the answer is Yes: occurrent, phenomenal awareness of one\u2019s reasons is not necessary for epistemic basing. What is necessary is that the attitude be produced and sustained by a competence that functions to track epistemic reasons and that places those reasons within a space of reflective accessibility\u2014i.e., the subject could, with ordinary reflective effort, cite considerations that are sufficiently close to the actual grounds of the belief. Conscious awareness is sufficient, but not necessary, for such basing. Modular, automatic, and sub-personal processes therefore can (and routinely do) yield justified beliefs. I defend this view by (i) clarifying the notion of basing; (ii) reconstructing the standard \u201cawareness requirement\u201d and diagnosing its appeal; (iii) presenting counter-examples that show awareness is not necessary; (iv) developing a competence-based alternative; and (v) answering residual objections about responsibility, defeat, and deviant causal chains.\n\nII. What Is Epistemic Basing?\n\nTo say that S\u2019s belief that p is justified because of evidence E is to say more than that E stands in an abstract evidential relation to p. It is to say that S\u2019s belief is based on E\u2014in virtue of some explanatory, typically causal, connection. This basing relation is located at the \u201cpersonal level\u201d: it is a relation in virtue of which an epistemic standing accrues to a mental state of the agent, under some description that figures in her cognitive economy. The disputed question is whether that relation always includes conscious appreciation of E, or whether non-conscious sensitivity to E can suffice.\n\nIII. The Awareness Requirement: Why It Seems Plausible\n\nDefenders of the requirement offer three main lines of thought.\n\n1. Agency and responsibility. Epistemic justification, they say, is answerability to reasons. One cannot be answerable to considerations of which one is entirely unaware. Our intuitive practice of praise and blame\u2014\u201cYou should have known better!\u201d\u2014presupposes that the agent had her reasons in view.\n\n2. Regress considerations. If the basing relation can obtain without awareness, justification becomes opaque: Why count some non-conscious causal routes as reason-responsive and others as deviant? Requiring awareness supplies an internal check that ends the regress of \u201cAnd how do you know that?\u201d\n\n3. Transparency: When we shift to the epistemic perspective, we ask ourselves, \u201cWhy do I believe p?\u201d and expect an answer in terms we can endorse. That first-person transparency, they argue, is constitutive of epistemic appraisal.\n\nTaken together, these considerations make the awareness requirement attractive: it promises a principled mark of epistemic agency and avoids collapsing justification into mere reliability.\n\nIV. Three Families of Counter-example\n\nThe requirement falters, however, when we consider commonplace cognitive cases.\n\n1. Perceptual belief. I look out the window and believe there is a red car parked outside. My reason is presumably my visual experience. But I am typically not aware of that reason under the description \u201cI see a red car.\u201d My belief is, rather, spontaneously triggered; I may only become reflectively aware of my experiential grounds if prompted. Yet nearly everyone agrees such perceptual beliefs are paradigms of justification.\n\n2. Automatic expertise. A chess grandmaster glances at a position and declares, \u201cQg4 wins.\u201d Asked why, she might initially say, \u201cIt just looks right,\u201d though, if pushed, she can unpack variations. The epistemic work is done by pattern-recognition modules honed through practice. Because the implicit statistical information is what makes the move correct, the belief is grounded in good reasons\u2014even before she retrieves them consciously.\n\n3. Linguistic comprehension. When a native speaker hears, \u201cThe senator objected to the bill,\u201d she instantly believes that the senator, not the bill, did the objecting, based on syntactic cues about thematic roles. Syntax operates sub-personally, yet surely her interpretation is epistemically warranted.\n\nThese cases are not exotic; they are the fabric of ordinary cognition. So if conscious awareness were necessary, the domain of justified belief would shrink to deliberative reasoning\u2014a revisionary and costly result.\n\nV. Diagnosing the Appeal of the Requirement\n\nWhy, then, did the awareness requirement look compelling? Notice two conflations. First, between occurrent awareness and reflective availability. The fact that I can, upon reflection, cite E does not entail that I was consciously attending to E at t1, when I formed the belief. Second, between subjective justification (what S can humbly vindicate) and objective justification (what considerations genuinely supported her belief). The awareness theorist tries to secure both with a single condition, but this over-strains the notion of basing.\n\nVI. A Competence-Based Account of Basing\n\n1. Core idea. A belief is epistemically based on reasons R just in case it is produced and sustained by a cognitive competence whose proper function is to track truths via sensitivity to R-type information. Conscious awareness is one mode in which such sensitivity can manifest, but not the only one. On this view, basing is neither a mere causal link (too promiscuous) nor a purely phenomenological link (too demanding), but a teleological, function-grounded relation analogous to biological explanation: the heart\u2019s beating circulates the blood whether or not it feels itself doing so.\n\n2. Reflective accessibility. Still, epistemic agency matters. Competences that ground justification must integrate with higher-level cognition such that the subject can, given ordinary effort, bring the operative reasons into view. The grandmaster who can eventually spell out the combination meets this condition; the clairvoyant who cannot, does not. Accessibility, not occurrent awareness, is what responsibility requires.\n\n3. Normative functioning. The competence must be functioning properly in the environment for which it was selected or trained. When vision is distorted by psychedelic drugs, perceptual beliefs lose justification even though produced by the same module. This \u201cproper functioning\u201d clause screens off deviant causal chains without invoking awareness.\n\nVII. Meeting the Objections\n\nA. Responsibility and answerability. Critics worry that if I am not aware of my reasons, I cannot own my beliefs. The competence model preserves responsibility because it ties justification to capacities that are under the agent\u2019s rational control in the long run. I am commendable for using my vision and blame-worthy if I ignore clear defeaters (e.g., evidence I\u2019m hallucinating). Responsibility accrues at the level of maintaining healthy competences and monitoring their outputs\u2014tasks that presuppose, but do not reducibly consist in, moment-by-moment awareness.\n\nB. The regress. The awareness theorist hopes to halt a regress by having each belief explicitly underwritten by another representational state. But that demand is self-defeating; it would require an infinite stack of higher-order beliefs. Competence-based basing is regress-resistant because competences are not themselves beliefs; they are standing abilities whose normative status rests on a posteriori facts about reliable design. The chain therefore terminates in the proper functioning of the cognitive system.\n\nC. Transparency. Admittedly, first-person access is central to the epistemic perspective. Yet transparency is a regulative ideal, not a constitutive feature. My perspective enlarges when I discover the optics of color perception; I thereby gain finer-grained awareness of my reasons. But my earlier, naive color beliefs were nonetheless justified insofar as the same healthy visual system produced them. Justification is graded: consciousness sharpens it but is not its pre-condition.\n\nVIII. Handling Potential Counter-examples\n\n1. Blindsight. In blindsight, patients lack visual consciousness yet can guess object locations above chance. Are these guesses justified? No: although the sub-personal information is reliable, it is not integrated with the subject\u2019s broader cognition; she herself takes the guesses to be random. That is why blindsight is epistemically defective. The competence account captures this: the relevant module is severed from higher-level systems, so reflective accessibility is absent.\n\n2. Cognitive penetrability and wishful thinking. Suppose I desire that the stock market rise, and that desire non-consciously biases my interpretation of ambiguous financial news toward optimism. Is the resulting belief justified? The competence model says no: the biasing mechanism is not truth-aimed; it is a performance error in the reasoning system. Lack of consciousness does not condemn, but the improper function does.\n\n3. The clairvoyant (BonJour). A clairvoyant believes that the President is in New York, on the basis of a reliable but mysterious faculty of which she is not aware. Lacking any reason to trust the process, she is not justified. Again, the competence account explains why: the faculty is not integrated with her network of epistemic competences; she lacks the capacity to recognize or respond to defeaters. Awareness could have served integration, but what is essential is integration itself.\n\nIX. Why Modularity Is Epistemically Potent\n\nCognitive science portrays the mind as a patchwork of specialized, often encapsulated modules. If the awareness requirement were true, most outputs of these modules would fall outside the scope of epistemic appraisal. Yet our practices\u2014scientific, everyday, and philosophical\u2014grade visual, auditory, and syntactic deliverances as evidence. The competence model vindicates this practice without collapsing epistemology into psychologism. It credits modular deliverances when (i) they are the outputs of proper functioning mechanisms designed or learned to track truth, and (ii) the subject retains the ability to vet, contest, or corroborate those outputs.\n\nX. Deliberative Versus Automatic Basing\n\nWe can now distinguish two species of basing.\n\n1. Deliberative basing: The evidential considerations are present to consciousness as premises in an explicit inference. This is common in theoretical reasoning and in philosophical reflection.\n\n2. Automatic basing: The evidential considerations are processed sub-personally; the resulting belief springs up without conscious inference. This is common in perception, language, face recognition, moral cognition, and expert intuition.\n\nBoth are epistemically potent, though the former affords finer self-scrutiny. We can even chart a continuum: what begins life as deliberative often becomes automatized through practice (driving a car, doing arithmetic). Automatization does not bleed away justification; indeed, it often increases reliability.\n\nXI. Interaction with Defeat\n\nOne might worry that, absent awareness, the subject cannot appreciate defeaters. Yet competence-based basing has the resources to explain defeat. If a belief B is based on module M\u2019s output, then a defeater D is any input that, given M\u2019s proper function and its integration with higher cognition, should lead S to suspend or revise B. For perceptual beliefs, learning that one\u2019s drink was spiked with LSD is a defeater; for moral intuitions, learning about framing effects may be partial defeater. The key again is integration: being part of a self-correcting network makes modules accountable to each other.\n\nXII. Implications for Epistemic Theories\n\nOur conclusion pushes against two poles of the internalism/externalism debate.\n\n\u2022 Pure access internalism (justification supervenes on what is reflectively accessible) is too strict; it cannot credit justified perceptual beliefs in infants or animals.\n\n\u2022 Pure process reliabilism is too lax; it credits clairvoyant beliefs and blindsight guesses that are not within the subject\u2019s rational reach.\n\nThe competence model is a moderate externalism tempered by internalist accessibility: justification depends on reliable functioning, but only in competences poised for integration with reflective cognition. This hybrid captures the best intuitions on both sides.\n\nXIII. Residual Worries\n\n(1) Isn\u2019t \u201ccould become aware with effort\u201d a fudge factor? No. There are empirical markers for integration: inter-modular causal pathways, availability to working memory, ability to trigger surprise when mismatched with higher-level expectations. These can be studied scientifically.\n\n(2) Does the view over-intellectualize animal knowledge? Not if we relativize reflective accessibility to species-typical capacities. For a dog, integration might require only that olfactory perception link to motor planning and error correction. Conscious reasons enter only where the architecture supports them.\n\nXIV. What We Gain\n\n1. A unified account. We need not posit two fundamentally different notions of justification\u2014one for deliberation, one for perception.\n\n2. Compatibility with cognitive science. The mind\u2019s modularity and automaticity are not embarrassments but the engines of epistemic success.\n\n3. Flexibility. The view predicts gradations of justification: as automatic outputs gain or lose integration (e.g., through neurological damage), the epistemic status shifts accordingly.\n\n4. Responsiveness to agency. Responsibility is preserved insofar as agents maintain, monitor, and, when possible, improve their competences.\n\nXV. Conclusion\n\nOccurrent awareness of reasons is epistemically potent but not indispensable. What grounds the basing relation is the operation of truth-tracking competences that make reasons\u2014whether perceptual, inferential, or statistical\u2014matter causally to belief formation, and that embed those reasons within a system open to reflection, criticism, and correction. The consciousness requirement conflates the phenomenology of inquiry with its underlying functional architecture. Once we disentangle them, we see that modular, automatic cognition is not merely compatible with epistemic basing; it is one of its primary vehicles.", "output_tokens": 3346, "reasoning_tokens": 512}

I shall argue that it does not. Occurrent consciousness of reasons is neither necessary for, nor constitutive of, the basing relation that underwrites epistemic justification. What matters instead is that the subject \u2014 under the right reflective and motivational profile \u2014 stands in a counterfactual-supporting, agency-implicating relation to the considerations that actually guide the formation or retention of her belief. Conscious access can facilitate that relation, and sometimes is required for higher-order epistemic goods (like understanding or knowledge that one knows), but it is not required for the basic normative status of being justified. In defending this thesis I proceed as follows.\n\n1. The dialectical landscape: why consciousness is thought essential.  \n2. Clarifying the basing relation: from causal pathways to rational guidance.  \n3. A graded conception of awareness: occurrent, standing, and potential.  \n4. Three arguments against the consciousness requirement.  \n5. Replying to four influential objections.  \n6. Positive account: agency-centred counterfactualism.  \n7. Implications for modular cognition and automatic inference.  \n8. Residual worries and prospects for future work.\n\nThroughout I use \u201creasons\u201d narrowly for epistemic reasons \u2014 considerations that bear on the truth of a proposition and can justify belief.\n\n1. Why think consciousness is required?\n\nThe consciousness requirement is attractive for at least three connected motivations.\n\na. Accessibility Intuition: Justification seems to be something we can *give* when challenged (\u201cWhy believe p?\u201d). If I cannot even bring to mind the reasons on which my belief is based, it is hard to see how the belief could be my rational doing rather than a mere causal happening.\n\nb. New Evil Demon Parity: Internalists stress that two phenomenally indistinguishable subjects should share justificatory status. Thus, what justifies must be within the phenomenal perspective.\n\nc. Guidance of Reason: To exercise my capacity as a rational agent I must *follow* reasons. Following appears to be a consciously guided activity.\n\nThese lines of thought suggest that if reasons operate entirely subpersonally, the agent is sidelined; whatever normative status accrues is, at best, a happy accident of cognitive engineering, not genuine rationality.\n\n2. The basing relation\n\nTo assess the consciousness claim we need a clear conception of the basing relation, the \u201cbecause\u201d that links a belief to its justificatory grounds. Two traditions dominate:\n\nCausal accounts: A belief is based on R just in case R non-deviantly causes (or sustains) the belief.\n\nReason-manifesting accounts: The belief is based on R iff the belief\u2019s formation manifests the subject\u2019s sensitivity to R as a reason; had R been absent or defeated, the belief would have changed in reason-appropriate ways.\n\nPurely causal models are too permissive (the chicken-sexer\u2019s lucky hunch can be caused by subtle features of the chicks without those features being reasons) whereas purely manifesting models can be too stringent (they threaten to collapse basing into conscious following). I propose a hybrid: basing requires (i) causal dependence of the belief on R under (ii) an *agency-implying rational sensitivity* condition. The agent\u2019s cognitive architecture must be such that, *ceteris paribus*, variations in R would lead her to correspondingly rational doxastic variation. This modal condition counters deviant causation. Notice that it makes no mention of occurrent consciousness; it is a condition on capacities and counterfactuals.\n\n3. Three grades of awareness\n\nWe need a richer taxonomy than \u201cconscious/unconscious\u201d.\n\n\u2022 Occurrent awareness: the reason is presently before the mind, tokened in working memory or inner speech.\n\n\u2022 Standing (or dispositional) awareness: the subject is not presently entertaining R, but could, with minimal reflection, recall or recognize it as her basis.\n\n\u2022 Potential awareness: the subject could not articulate R even after reflection, yet the cognitive system she appropriately identifies with could, through learning or therapy, make R occurrent. Think of implicit biases one can eventually surface.\n\nConsciousness sceptics about basing need show only that standing or potential awareness suffices for justification.\n\n4. Arguments against the consciousness requirement\n\n(i) The Continuity of Epistemic Practice\n\nOur everyday attributions of justified belief do not track occurrent awareness. Suppose Alice glances at her office clock (which she has every reason to trust) at 3 pm, then becomes absorbed in writing. At 3:15 she believes it is approximately 3 pm. She has forgotten the perceptual experience; her belief is now subserved by memory. It seems paradigmatically justified, yet she is not consciously aware of any reason. To insist that her belief\u2019s justificatory status evaporates the moment the perceptual content fades from consciousness is ad hoc and conflicts with epistemic practice.\n\n(ii) The Problem of Inferential Intermediate Steps\n\nMany deductive and statistical inferences rely on background rules we cannot consciously rehearse. Consider Bayesian updating: cognitive scientists posit quasi-Bayesian mechanisms in perceptual learning. When I see a blurred object and judge it is more likely a dog than a cat, that judgment is sensitive to the likelihoods of the percept under competing hypotheses. I lack conscious access to the conditional probability tables, yet the belief qualifies as epistemically good. Requiring awareness would render much of human (and scientific) inference unjustified unless mediated by overt reasoning, which is psychologically implausible.\n\n(iii) The Child Epistemologist\n\nChildren acquire justified beliefs long before they can give reasons. A four-year-old who sees rain and believes the street is wet is justified. To deny this is to tie justification to sophisticated metacognition, contradicting developmental evidence about confident but epistemically appropriate belief in infancy. But if children can be justified without conscious reasons, so, by parity, can adults whose automatic modules do the same job.\n\n5. Replies to four objections\n\nObjection 1: Conscious recall vs. conscious availability\n\nDefenders of the requirement might concede that occurrent awareness is not needed, but standing awareness is. Alice can *recover* the perceptual reason on demand; the Bayesian cannot. Is this a principled line?\n\nReply: Many perceptual cases do not allow standing awareness of reasons beyond \u201cit looks that way.\u201d Yet internalists accept such reasons. The Bayesian visual system delivers the \u201clooks\u201d content; the subject can cite it (\u201cIt looks like a dog\u201d), satisfying standing awareness. Similarly, an implicit statistical reason can be available under generic descriptions the subject owns (\u201cThe evidence of what I saw\u201d). Thus the line collapses.\n\nObjection 2: Epistemic Responsibility\n\nJustification is tied to responsibility; we can criticise beliefs for which the agent cannot provide reasons. So subpersonal basing excuses responsibility.\n\nReply: Responsibility is gradable. Holding agents answerable does not entail they must articulate their operative reasons in real-time; rather, they must be able to revise beliefs when presented with new reasons. Agency-centric counterfactualism secures this: if the dog-like patch turned out to be a trick of light, the subject would (ceteris paribus) drop the dog belief. That capacity grounds responsibility.\n\nObjection 3: Swamping by Reliability\n\nIf subpersonal processes suffice, epistemic justification collapses into reliabilism. Consciousness marks the distinctively normative level.\n\nReply: The agency condition restores normativity. A belief formed by a reliable but totally encapsulated mechanism (a brain implant none of whose informational states integrate with the subject\u2019s doxastic network) would fail the agency condition and thus fail to be justified. Reliability is necessary but not sufficient; integration in the agent\u2019s reasoning system matters.\n\nObjection 4: The Problem of Forgotten Evidence\n\nThe memory case shows that justification can persist without consciousness, but only derivatively: originally the belief was conscious, then memory inherits warrant. Automatic modular processes lack such pedigree.\n\nReply: The heritage model does not explain first-time justified beliefs delivered by vision, proprioception, or linguistic uptake, none of which involve prior conscious access to the subpersonal computations. Yet they are prima facie justified. Therefore pedigree cannot do the work.\n\n6. Positive proposal: agency-centred counterfactualism\n\nA subject S\u2019s belief that p is epistemically based on reasons R iff:\n\n(a) R are in fact explanatorily causally implicated in S\u2019s forming or sustaining p, via mechanisms that belong to S\u2019s cognitive agency \u2014 those upon which S relies in epistemic conduct.  \n(b) The mechanism is *rationally sensitive to R*: under counterfactual scenarios where R were absent, or salient defeaters present, the mechanism would, in normal operating conditions, refrain from or revise p.  \n(c) The information encoded by R is, under reflection and with sufficient cognitive resources, integrable into S\u2019s conscious deliberation, permitting uptake into the space of reasons (though no guarantee it will actually be so integrated).\n\nClause (c) secures the connection with responsibility and reflection without demanding occurrent awareness. Clause (b) blocks deviant causal chains. Clause (a) ensures the belief\u2019s formation is genuinely *hers* rather than imposed.\n\n7. Modular cognition and automatic inference\n\nOn this view, modular processes can indeed yield epistemically based beliefs insofar as they meet the agency counterfactual. Perceptual modules, face-recognition systems, or linguistic decoders are not alien invaders; they are constitutive of our cognitive agency. They operate automatically, but their outputs are poised for rational control: we can suppress them when given override information (e.g., Muller-Lyer illusion lines are equal length; prosopagnosics learn to distrust \u201cface looks familiar\u201d intuitions). This capacity for override satisfies (b) and (c). Where override is impossible (a fMRI-based mind-control device implanting beliefs irrespective of defeaters) justification fails.\n\nThe upshot is layered normativity:  \n\n\u2022 Subpersonal reliability is epistemically relevant when *integrated*.  \n\u2022 Conscious reflection adds higher-order justification, yielding *warrant security* (knowledge that one\u2019s belief is justified).  \n\u2022 Modular automatic beliefs are often *prima facie* justified, defeasible by higher-level scrutiny.\n\nThis maps neatly onto epistemic practice: we trust perception provisionally, override when warned of illusions, and demand explicit arguments in contentious domains.\n\n8. Residual worries and next steps\n\nTwo challenges merit future exploration.\n\nFirst, does the agency-centred approach imply that non-human animals or infants, whose override capacities are limited, seldom have justified beliefs? I am inclined to a two-tier model: justification-as-apt (possession of truth-conducive processes) is available widely; justification-as-responsible (agent-level counterfactual sensitivity) comes in degrees. The basal tier suffices for many epistemic evaluations, the upper for assessments of cognitive responsibility.\n\nSecond, the account leans on modal claims about how the subject would respond to defeaters. Empirically, humans resist correction in belief perseverance scenarios. Does that undermine justification? I think not: the relevant modality is \u201cunder normal rational functioning.\u201d Psychological impediments like motivational bias can prevent ideal operation. Justification should not be hostage to akrasia; otherwise no belief would be justified for imperfect agents. Still, calibrating the normalcy condition is delicate and intersects with debates over idealized epistemic norms.\n\nConclusion\n\nOccurrent conscious awareness is not required for a mental state to be epistemically based on reasons. Justification hinges on whether the belief stands in a reason-sensitive relation to considerations integrated within the subject\u2019s cognitive agency. Modular, automatic processes qualify provided they are reliable, defeater-sensitive, and poised for reflective endorsement. Conscious reflection deepens epistemic status but is not its ground floor. Thus the challenge to modular epistemology dissolves: lack of current awareness does not bar genuine epistemic basing; it merely locates that basing at a sub-personal yet agency-integrated level.", "output_tokens": 2896, "reasoning_tokens": 384}

Clarifying the terrain\n------------------------------------------------\n1.1 Epistemic basing.  A belief (or other cognitive attitude) is based on R when R is not merely available or possessed by the subject but actually plays the right kind of explanatory role in producing or sustaining the attitude.   Two broad families of accounts exist: causal-explanatory theories (Alston 1988; Khatchadourian 1963) and teleological/functional theories (Turri 2011; Kelp 2015).  I remain ecumenical: both can accommodate my thesis as long as they accept sub-personal causation as epistemically relevant.\n\n1.2 \u201cReasons.\u201d  I follow the widely shared view that epistemic reasons are facts or states of affairs that stand in the right kind of evidential relation to a proposition.  They need not be propositions entertained by the agent; they can be non-conceptual contents delivered by perception.  What matters is their evidential bearing, not their conceptual format.\n\n1.3 Awareness and consciousness.  I count as \u201cconscious awareness\u201d the occurrent phenomenal availability of a ground as something one is thinking about.  \u201cDispositional awareness\u201d is weaker: one is in a position to retrieve or articulate the reason upon reflection.  My opponents usually require at least dispositional awareness; strict access internalists (Bonjour 1985; Feldman & Conee 1985) require occurrent awareness for justification simpliciter.\n\nI target the stronger view: basing requires at least dispositional awareness.  If that fails, so does the stronger claim.\n\n------------------------------------------------\n2. Two arguments for the awareness requirement\n------------------------------------------------\nThe literature offers two main lines of thought:\n\nA. The Guidance Argument.  Reasons are things by which we guide our beliefs.  Guiding requires representing.  Hence if the subject does not represent R, R cannot guide her belief; ergo no basing.\n\nB. The Responsibility Argument.  Epistemic justification is a form of normatively assessable responsibility.  One cannot be responsible for what one cannot access.  Therefore basing presupposes accessibility, i.e. awareness.\n\nBoth arguments possess intuitive force, but neither succeeds.\n\n2.1 Against Guidance.  \u201cGuidance\u201d is ambiguous between executive control and etiological explanation.  The riverbed guides the water\u2019s flow without representing alternatives.  Cognitive science furnishes many cases where sub-personal routines guide judgments: color constancy mechanisms discount illumination to yield stable color beliefs.  The subject lacks any representation of the discounting as evidence, yet the information plays a genuinely evidential role.  Representation by the subject is not required for representation in the cognitive system.\n\n2.2 Against Responsibility.  Responsibility comes in degrees and varieties.  We praise a skilled cyclist for keeping balanced even when her micro-corrections never rise to consciousness.  Similarly, epistemic responsibilists (e.g., Code 1984) treat perceptual belief as prima facie justified absent defeaters, though subjects cannot cite their perceptual grounds.  What is required for responsibility is ownership of the competence, not conscious control of every token execution.\n\n------------------------------------------------\n3. The positive case: three domains\n------------------------------------------------\n3.1 Perceptual justification.  Consider your belief that the cup before you is red.  Phenomenally, you enjoy a reddish visual experience.  But the evidential factor is not merely \u201cI seem to see a red cup,\u201d a high-level content you can articulate.  The actual information exploited includes low-level edge detectors, representation of surface reflectance, and probabilistic priors about lighting.  Ordinary perceivers lack access to these.  If awareness were necessary, no perceptual belief could ever count as justified\u2014an unacceptable sceptical consequence.\n\n3.2 Skill-based inference.  Chicken-sexers notoriously achieve 98 % accuracy at determining sex of day-old chicks but cannot articulate how they know.  Their beliefs are based on extremely subtle visual cues empirically correlated with sex.  Training instills a perceptual-categorical mapping sub-personally.  Intuitively, the mature chicken-sexer\u2019s judgments are better justified than random guesses.  The justificatory difference resides in the reliability and evidential fit of the sub-personal cue utilization, not in conscious access.\n\n3.3 Empirical psychology of reasoning.  Dual-process theorists (Evans & Stanovich 2013) distinguish \u201cSystem 1\u201d fast, automatic processes from \u201cSystem 2\u201d controlled processes.  Research on implicit statistical inference (Gigerenzer et al. 2011) shows subjects integrating base-rate information they cannot explicitly report.  Their beliefs track the evidence, hence are epistemically better off, yet the reasons never reach awareness.\n\n------------------------------------------------\n4. A dual-level account of basing without awareness\n------------------------------------------------\nHow, then, can R base M if S is unaware of R?  I propose:\n\nFunctional Ownership Thesis (FOT).  A reason R epistemically bases a mental state M in subject S when:  \n(i) R is a proximal cause of M through a cognitive mechanism \u03a6 that subserves S\u2019s epistemic aims (truth, accuracy);  \n(ii) \u03a6 is a competence belonging to S\u2014integrated with her overall cognitive architecture and responsive to relevant defeaters; and  \n(iii) if S were to engage in conscious reflection under idealized conditions (no time pressure, attention available, etc.), she could, by exploiting \u03a6, come to appreciate at least a proxy reason R* that tracks R\u2019s evidential bearing.\n\nFOT relaxes awareness but preserves the intuition that reasons must be in some sense \u201cavailable\u201d to the agent.  Availability is counterfactual and capacity-based, not occurrent.\n\n4.1 Why (iii) matters.  Suppose a clairvoyant, unbeknownst to herself, has reliable hunches about the president\u2019s location (Bonjour 1980).  Her mechanism is reliable but encapsulated; under reflection she gains no explanatory grip.  Condition (iii) fails: no pathway from sub-personal cue to reflective endorsement.  Hence her belief lacks justification, matching the common verdict.\n\n4.2 Non-conceptual reasons.  On FOT, R may be a non-conceptual state (e.g., a high-dimensional feature vector delivered by early vision).  The proxy R* the agent can consciously access need not match R in content; it is enough that attending to the experience makes salient \u201cIt looks red,\u201d which tracks the underlying signal.\n\n------------------------------------------------\n5. Replies to four objections\n------------------------------------------------\nObjection 1: The Distorted-Input Worry.  If the agent is unaware of R, she cannot recognize defeaters.  Therefore her belief is irresponsible.\n\nReply.  Responsibility can be distributed.  Perceptual systems carry built-in defeater-detection (e.g., sensitivity to lighting cues).  Moreover, the agent remains obliged to monitor higher-order defeaters she can access (drugs, lighting anomalies).  Division of epistemic labor between sub-personal modules and conscious oversight is ubiquitous and sufficient.\n\nObjection 2: The New Evil Demon.  Victims of a deceptive matrix have the same sub-personal causation as normal perceivers; yet their beliefs seem justified.  Awareness would neatly capture this, reliability plus sub-personal causation would not.\n\nReply.  FOT is neutral on externalism vs internalism about justification.  One might build in condition (ii*) requiring subjective good function rather than objective reliability.  What matters for the present thesis is that awareness is not needed; internal states suffice whether or not the world cooperates.\n\nObjection 3: Over-intellectualization of animals.  If awareness is necessary, non-linguistic animals have no justified beliefs.  My opponent must accept this.  That is implausible: the squirrel that sees a hawk has good reason to flee.  The dual-level view comfortably assigns justification to animal perception.\n\nObjection 4: Trivialization.  If any sub-personal cause counts, basing loses normative bite; every belief has some cause.\n\nReply.  Component (ii) filters merely accidental causes.  Suppose I believe it rained because my knee aches.  The pain may be causally connected but not via a competence aimed at truth; so (ii) fails.  Normative orientation enters through the functional profile, not awareness.\n\n------------------------------------------------\n6. Broader implications\n------------------------------------------------\n6.1 Epistemic responsibility.  On the present picture, responsibility attaches to maintaining and repairing one\u2019s cognitive competences, not to accessing every reason token.  This is analogous to moral responsibility for implicit biases: one is responsible for tracking and mitigating them though they operate sub-personally.\n\n6.2 The scope of the mental.  If sub-personal processes can ground basing, then the personal/sub-personal boundary is porous with respect to epistemic evaluation.  This squares with naturalistic accounts of mind: what matters is whether a process is part of the agent\u2019s cognitive economy, not whether it is introspectible.\n\n6.3 Methodological caution.  Philosophers often over-rely on the \u201carmchair\u201d phenomenology of reasoning.  Empirical work shows that much reasoning is covert.  The awareness requirement thus reflects a parochial anthropocentric bias toward the articulable.\n\n------------------------------------------------\nConclusion\n------------------------------------------------\nLack of conscious awareness of one\u2019s reasons does not preclude a mental state from being epistemically based on those reasons.  Conscious access is a useful epistemic resource\u2014a defeater recognizer and an arena for critical scrutiny\u2014but it is not the sine qua non of basing.  A competence-oriented, dual-level account preserves the intuitive data: it vindicates the justification of ordinary perceptual belief, skilled but inarticulate expertise, and animal cognition, while still explaining why clairvoyant hunches and knee-ache meteorology fail.  The upshot is a more psychologically realistic epistemology that honours both normative demands and the architecture of the mind.", "output_tokens": 2801, "reasoning_tokens": 448}

A belief can be epistemically grounded by sub-personal, modular, or otherwise unconscious processes provided that (i) the processes are properly sensitive to epistemic reasons, (ii) they are stably available for rational scrutiny from the agent\u2019s standpoint (even if not presently accessed), and (iii) they belong to the suite of cognitive competencies for which the agent can legitimately be held epistemically responsible. Conscious reflectiveness therefore deepens and extends justification, but it is not the condition of its very possibility.\n\nThe case for this view proceeds in five steps.\n\n1. Clarifying \u201cepistemic basing\u201d and the \u201cawareness requirement.\u201d  \n2. Modular cognition and the empirical challenge to the awareness requirement.  \n3. Two prominent motivations for insisting on awareness\u2014and why they fail.  \n4. A positive account: competence-based basing without occurrent awareness.  \n5. Objections and replies.\n\nThe conclusion is that the awareness requirement mistakes a useful ideal of reflective endorsement for the ground floor of epistemic normativity. That floor is occupied instead by competences that track reasons whether or not they surface in consciousness.\n\n------------------------------------------------\n1. The conceptual terrain\n------------------------------------------------\n\n1.1 Epistemic reasons vs. causes  \nA *reason* in the epistemic sense is a fact (or proposition) that bears on the truth of some target proposition and so counts in favor of believing it. I have a reason to believe that the sparrow is wet because it is raining and the sparrow has been outside. A *basing relation* obtains when a subject believes p because (in the right way) she is moved by the reason that q. The classical puzzle is to spell out the \u201cright way.\u201d Merely causal production is too cheap: the rain\u2019s making the sparrow wet may also splash mud on my shoes, thereby causing me to slip; but the mud does not *justify* my fall.\n\n1.2 The awareness requirement  \nMany internalists (e.g., BonJour, Foley, and some reading of Chisholm) contend that S\u2019s belief that p is *epistemically based* on reason r only if S is in some sense conscious of r. Call this the Awareness Requirement (AR):\n\n(AR)   If belief B is justified for S in virtue of reason R, then S is consciously aware of R (or of the connection between R and B).\n\nVersions differ: the awareness may need to be occurrent, merely access-ible, or even only \u201ceasily brought to consciousness.\u201d What they share is denial that wholly unconscious processes can confer justificatory status.\n\n1.3 Why this matters  \nIf AR is true, then a large swath of cognition\u2014perceptual inferences, grammatical parsing, probabilistic updating, quick moral evaluations\u2014all lack *personal-level* justification. That is at odds with ordinary ascriptions of knowledge to children, non-linguistic adults, and even animals, for whom explicit awareness of reasons is often out of reach. Hence the stakes: affirming AR yields a demanding internalism; rejecting it accommodates the cognitive science of automaticity.\n\n------------------------------------------------\n2. The empirical challenge from modular cognition\n------------------------------------------------\n\n2.1 Visual perception  \nSuppose I look at a tomato in good light and come to believe, effortlessly, that it is red. Few of us entertain as a conscious premise \u201cConditions are normal so my color vision is reliable\u201d or \u201cPhotons of ~700 nm predominate.\u201d Yet perceptual psychologists tell us that an enormously complex process\u2014edge detection, color constancy correction, Bayesian noise reduction\u2014has taken place. Those processes are sensitive to reasons: they treat certain patterns of retinal stimulation as evidence for surface color. But they are not available to consciousness. On AR, the belief \u201cThat is a red tomato\u201d floats free of epistemic grounding; intuitively, though, it is a paradigm of justified belief.\n\n2.2 Implicit statistical learning  \nIn Reber\u2019s classic experiments, subjects exposed to strings generated by an artificial grammar can later classify new strings as grammatical above chance while being unable to articulate the rules. The best explanation is that they possess an unconscious sensitivity to structural cues. If they form the belief \u201cThis string is grammatical\u201d on that basis, is it unjustified? AR says yes; our ordinary epistemic practice says no\u2014such subjects have exactly the kind of evidence that matters, albeit tacit.\n\n2.3 Rapid moral judgments  \nStudies by Greene and Haidt suggest that people\u2019s immediate aversion to harming innocents is driven by automatic affective modules. When pressed, subjects often fail to cite explicit moral principles, yet we do not therefore regard their \u201cIt would be wrong to push the man off the footbridge\u201d as epistemically groundless. We may question the moral theory behind it, but not claim it has *no* basis.\n\nThese cases threaten AR: either we deny justification to most everyday and expert cognition, or we allow that basing does not require conscious awareness.\n\n------------------------------------------------\n3. Why insist on awareness? Two motivations examined\n------------------------------------------------\n\n3.1 Responsibility and the deontic conception of justification  \nSome internalists tie justification to *epistemic blameworthiness*: S ought not believe beyond her evidence; a justified belief is one for which S is epistemically blameless. If reasons are inaccessible, how can S be *guided* by them and thus creditable for getting things right? Awareness therefore seems required for epistemic responsibility.\n\nReply. Responsibility does not track introspectibility but competence. A pilot may be praiseworthy for a safe landing executed partly by ingrained muscle memory. Similarly, an agent who exercises a reliable but unconscious color-discrimination module manifests an epistemic competence for which she deserves credit. What matters is whether the process is hers in the sense of being stably integrated into her cognitive agency and susceptible, at least in principle, to rational revision (e.g., she can learn she is color-blind and suspend color judgments). Credit and blame attach to the agent, not to introspection.\n\n3.2 The opacity of basing and the deviant-causal worry  \nWithout awareness, how do we distinguish proper basing from deviant causal chains? Suppose my belief that \u201cI will succeed\u201d stems not from the good evidence I possess but from wishful thinking that just happens to latch onto the same reasons. AR offers an elegant filter: only consciously cited reasons can legitimately ground belief.\n\nReply. The deviance problem is real, but consciousness is neither necessary nor sufficient to solve it. One can be aware of a reason and still form the belief via wishful thinking, self-deception, or emotional bias. Conversely, non-conscious but *reason-responsive* mechanisms can track evidence while screening off deviant causes. What we need is not awareness but the right *functional role*: a counterfactual pattern whereby the belief would vary with the strength and character of the evidence. Proper etiology, not phenomenology, screens off deviance.\n\n------------------------------------------------\n4. A competence-based account of unconscious basing\n------------------------------------------------\n\n4.1 The proposal  \nBelief B is epistemically based on reason R for subject S iff:\n\n(i) R non-deviantly causes B in virtue of the operation of cognitive competence C;  \n(ii) C is a stable, reliable, and *epistemically proper* way of using information of type R for believing propositions of type P;  \n(iii) S is (a) disposed to recognize C as a source of belief upon reflection and (b) capable of revising or inhibiting C-outputs in light of higher-order reasons.\n\nConditions (i)\u2013(iii) vindicate unconscious basing because the causal work happens sub-personally (i), but the competence belongs to the subject\u2019s integrated rational repertoire (ii) and remains open to reflective endorsement or override (iii). Conscious awareness is sufficient but not necessary: if the subject becomes occurrently aware of R, that simply adds an avenue for rational control; the justificatory status was already in place by virtue of the competence.\n\n4.2 Why \u201cavailability without occurrence\u201d suffices  \nA popular internalist retreat is to weaken AR to *dispositional* or *potential* awareness (Conee & Feldman). My view overlaps in allowing that reflection can bring the reasons to mind. But the critical point is that this *potential* does not itself do justificatory work; it is only evidence that the underlying competence is integrated enough to be revisable. Infants and smart animals, lacking that potential, can still have competences that justify their beliefs for *them*, even if we will not demand the same reflectiveness we expect of adult humans. Epistemic justification thus scales with developmental and species norms of competence.\n\n4.3 Comparison with externalism  \nProcess reliabilists (Goldman) already deny AR by identifying justification with reliably truth-conducive processes. My competence view is *modestly internalist*: it incorporates a *reflective accessibility* clause (iii) absent in pure reliabilism. That clause anchors responsibility and provides the agent with a \u201crational seatbelt\u201d\u2014the capacity to check or override automatic outputs. Yet the justification of first-order belief is not suspended until the seatbelt is fastened; it accrues from competent operation itself.\n\n------------------------------------------------\n5. Objections and replies\n------------------------------------------------\n\nObjection 1. The view over-intellectualizes infants and animals by attributing them \u201ccompetences\u201d in the normative, responsibility-laden sense.\n\nReply. Competence can be graded. A spider\u2019s web-building embodies a biological competence but not an epistemic one because spiders cannot revise the process in light of counter-evidence. By contrast, many mammals display belief revision (rats stop pressing a lever when food no longer appears). The relevant notion is *minimal rational control*: the capacity, however limited, to modulate behavior according to environmental feedback. That suffices for a thin notion of epistemic responsibility tailored to the creature.\n\nObjection 2. Without explicit awareness, how can the subject distinguish genuine from merely apparent reasons? The unconscious may treat a face\u2019s *familiarity* as evidence of truth (the mere-exposure effect). Doesn\u2019t that blur justification and bias?\n\nReply. A competence is disqualified if it is systematically insensitive to truth-related factors. Mere exposure effects are unreliable; they therefore fail clause (ii). The competence condition filters them out regardless of consciousness. By contrast, the color-vision module or statistical grammar module passes; it is truth-tracking within its domain.\n\nObjection 3. What about situations where the agent\u2019s higher-level evidence defeats her lower-level competence? Suppose I know I took a hallucination-inducing drug; my color experience still presents the tomato as red. Without awareness, I seem forced to accept the perceptual output.\n\nReply. Clause (iii) includes the *capability* to override. If the agent lacks the higher-order awareness that she is impaired, the competence remains her best epistemic option. Once she gains the defeating information, rational responsibility requires revision. Thus unconscious basing is defeasible by new, possibly conscious reasons\u2014a desirable feature.\n\nObjection 4. Isn\u2019t phenomenology essential to justify \u201ctaking\u201d something as a reason? A reason, unlike a cause, must be appreciated *as* a reason.\n\nReply. Appreciation need not be conscious. Consider the skilled typist who can no longer spell out the QWERTY layout but still \u201cknows\u201d where each key is: her motor system encodes positional information and acts on it. Analogously, early-vision encodings \u201cappreciate\u201d spectral distributions as reasons to categorize surfaces. The appreciation is functionally manifest in correct use, not in self-representation.\n\nObjection 5. Couldn\u2019t this collapse into mere reliabilism? If competence is defined by reliability, you have not escaped the externalist camp.\n\nReply. Reliability is necessary but not sufficient. Competence also requires *ownership*\u2014integration into the agent\u2019s critical reflective capacities. A reliabilist could attribute justification to clairvoyants whose faculties they cannot monitor; on my view, such faculties fail clause (iii). Thus the theory is hybrid: externalist about first-order tracking, internalist about second-order ownership.\n\n------------------------------------------------\nConclusion: what conscious awareness really does\n------------------------------------------------\n\nWe can now answer the guiding question.\n\nDoes lack of conscious awareness of one\u2019s reasons preclude epistemic basing? No. Epistemic basing consists in an agent\u2019s deploying competences that are (a) reliably sensitive to truth-conducive reasons in their domain, and (b) situated within a cognitive architecture that, in principle, allows reflective modulation. Conscious awareness is one avenue for such modulation, but not its precondition. The vibrant menagerie of automatic, modular, and sub-personal processes revealed by cognitive science can therefore ground justified belief. Reflective consciousness refines, monitors, and sometimes overrides those processes; it does not bestow justificatory legitimacy ex nihilo.\n\nThis conclusion vindicates much ordinary and scientific practice. We credit observers, experts, children, and animals with justified beliefs even when they cannot articulate their grounds. We also maintain normative expectations: agents must cultivate and safeguard their competences, remain open to defeating evidence, and engage in reflection where appropriate. Justification thus resides in the living relation between reason-tracking competences and the agent\u2019s capacity, however minimal, to own and improve them. Conscious awareness may be the brightest spotlight on that stage, but the play can go on\u2014and often does\u2014in the dark.", "output_tokens": 3183, "reasoning_tokens": 320}

Introduction  \n\nCan a belief be epistemically justified by considerations that never so much as flicker across the believer\u2019s conscious field? Internalists about justification often think not: if the subject\u2019s mental state is to manifest the right kind of basing relation to reasons, the subject must be aware\u2014indeed consciously aware\u2014of those reasons. Otherwise, the belief may be causally produced by the reasons but it will not be the subject\u2019s reasoned belief; it will lack the kind of \u201cownership\u201d that makes it eligible for epistemic appraisal. My thesis is the contrary. Occurrent conscious awareness of one\u2019s reasons is not a necessary condition for epistemic basing. What is required is (i) that the reasons stand in the right kind of reliable, non-deviant causal relation to the resulting attitude, and (ii) that the subject possess the standing capacity to bring the operative reasons under conscious scrutiny when circumstances of reflection demand it. Once we distinguish occurrent consciousness from standing, accessible representation, and the normative notion of a reason from the psychological notion of a cause, we can see that modular, automatic cognition may constitute genuine reasoning\u2014even when it unfolds beneath the limelight of attention.\n\nThe argument proceeds in four stages. Section 2 clarifies the competing conceptions of reasons, basing, and consciousness that animate the debate. Section 3 reconstructs three influential arguments for the consciousness requirement and diagnoses their shared mistake. Section 4 develops a positive account\u2014call it the \u201cAccessible Competence\u201d model\u2014on which automatic processes can ground justification so long as they are (a) epistemically reliable competences and (b) counterfactually integrated with the subject\u2019s reflective capacities. Section 5 addresses two prominent objections: the Deviant Causation objection and the Defeater Ignorance objection. I close by considering how the view illuminates familiar cases such as linguistic comprehension, chicken-sexer expertise, and blindsight, concluding that epistemic evaluation extends farther into the cognitive unconscious than traditional access internalism allows.\n\n2. Conceptual Preliminaries  \n\n2.1 Normative vs. motivating reasons.  \nA normative reason is a fact that counts in favor of some attitude; a motivating reason is the consideration for which the agent actually holds the attitude. The present dispute concerns motivating reasons: what it is in virtue of which a particular belief is epistemically based. Still, any account of basing must respect the link to normativity: the operative considerations must also be the sorts of things that, if true, would support the belief.\n\n2.2 The basing relation.  \nTwo broad pictures dominate. On the causal\u2010psychological picture, S\u2019s belief that p is based on R just in case R (or S\u2019s believing R) non-deviantly causes S to believe p. On the rational-agency picture, basing requires more than causation; it demands that S treat R as a reason, typically realized by conscious endorsement or inference. The consciousness requirement belongs to the second family.\n\n2.3 Occurrent vs. standing consciousness.  \nEven hardcore internalists distinguish between occurrent awareness (what is \u201cbefore the mind\u2019s eye\u201d now) and standing accessibility (what one could easily make conscious upon inquiry). I argue that standing accessibility, not occurrent presence, is what epistemic responsibility requires.\n\n3. Three Arguments for the Consciousness Requirement  \n\n3.1 The Transparency Argument  \nPerception of one\u2019s reasons, the argument runs, is constitutive of rational basing: when I actively reflect why I believe that there will be an eclipse tomorrow, I \u201clook outward\u201d at the evidence (the almanac entry) rather than inward at my belief. The sense that my belief is justified is thus inseparable from my being aware of its grounds. But the move from a phenomenological datum about reflective endorsement to a metaphysical claim about basing is invalid. At most, the transparency phenomenon shows that occurrent awareness is typical when we aim to vindicate a belief under reflective scrutiny; it does not show that the underlying basing relation never obtains until such scrutiny occurs. The data are equally explained if occurrent consciousness is a means of *checking* a standing basing relation, not a constitutive ingredient of it.\n\n3.2 The Agency Argument  \nEpistemic evaluation, it is said, presupposes a form of cognitive agency. Beliefs are imputable to us because we exercise doxastic control, and such control is impossible without conscious uptake of reasons. Yet agency comes in degrees. Many intentional actions (catching a ball, braking at a red light) issue from automated routines we could not articulate moment-to-moment. We remain accountable for them because they express competences that are stably integrated into our deliberative machinery. Analogously, automatic belief-forming competences\u2014visual object recognition, syntactic parsing\u2014are subject to higher-level endorsement or revision, and that is sufficient for epistemic responsibility.\n\n3.3 The Basing Error Argument  \nSubjects are often mistaken about what reasons actually move them. If basing could occur unconsciously, we could never be sure which considerations grounded our beliefs, so first-person judgments of justification would be hopelessly unreliable. But again, the conclusion overreaches. The possibility of error does not entail that basing requires consciousness, only that reflective self-assessment is fallible. Moreover, the envisaged skeptical upshot is intolerable only if we adopt a strong internalism that makes justification hinge on what the subject can immediately tell about her basis. Externalists about justification happily accept that one can be justified without infallible self-knowledge.\n\n4. The Accessible Competence Model  \n\nThe alternative I propose has two pillars.\n\nPillar 1: Reliably Truth-Conducive Competences  \nA cognitive process qualifies as an epistemic basing mechanism if it is a *competence*\u2014a stable, counterfactually robust disposition to deliver beliefs in a way that truth-conducively tracks environmental reasons. Vision, audition, basic statistical learning, and many forms of expert pattern recognition fit this description. Reliabilism supplies the core normative metric: processes that systematically hook up the world\u2019s epistemically relevant features to belief deserve prima facie justification credit.\n\nPillar 2: Integration with Reflective Accessibility  \nEven a reliable competence can malfunction or be swamped by defeat. Hence the second requirement: the products of the competence must remain appropriately sensitive to the subject\u2019s higher-order capacities for reflection, doubt, and correction. Integration manifests in two ways: (i) defeaters that the agent can recognize will normally prevent belief formation or trigger re-evaluation, and (ii) when asked, the agent can, at least in principle, articulate considerations doing justificatory work, perhaps after minimal prompting or memory search. Crucially, articulation need not reproduce the subpersonal algorithm, only the *publicly available* facts it keeps track of (e.g., \u201cIt looks red,\u201d \u201cThe instrument has always been reliable,\u201d \u201cThis pattern matches past cancerous slides\u201d).\n\nWhy think these jointly sufficient? First, they preserve the intuitive distinction between *mere causation* and *epistemic grounding.* A belief formed by brain-tampering or wishful thinking fails the reliability prong; one formed by a reliable but insulated module (say, an oracle implant that blocks awareness of contradicting data) fails the integration prong. Second, they vindicate the epistemic status of ordinary perceptual and inferential beliefs whose subpersonally computed reasons never reach occurrent consciousness. Finally, they explain why reflective endorsement typically *raises* the justificatory standing: it either confirms that the competence is functioning well or allows the subject to spot defeaters.\n\n5. Objections and Replies  \n\n5.1 Deviant Causation  \nSuppose a reliable capacity normally integrates vision with belief, but in a particular case a lesion causes the belief through an abnormal shortcut that bypasses the usual information processing. The competence is reliable in general, the subject could have reflected, yet the belief seems *lucky.* Does the Accessible Competence model falsely rate it justified?\n\nNo. The reliability condition is process-token, not merely process-type: the actual causal pathway must instantiate the competence\u2019s normal explanatory pattern. Bypasses and lesions alter that pattern, so the reliability prong is not met. Thus the account blocks deviant cases without invoking consciousness.\n\n5.2 Defeater Ignorance  \nImagine a subject whose visual system automatically forms the belief that the wall is white. Unknown to her, the room is bathed in trick lighting that makes everything look white. She lacks conscious access to her reasons (comparative chromatic cues) and thus cannot notice the defeater. If she were aware of her grounds, she might infer the presence of colored illumination. Internalists claim she is therefore unjustified.\n\nThe Accessible Competence view says: the competence for color vision here is unreliable in those circumstances, so the reliability prong fails. The problem is not the lack of conscious awareness per se but the environmental defeat of the competence\u2019s truth-tracking. If the same subject had hyperspectral vision covertly compensating for the lighting, her belief would be justified despite her unawareness; if not, it would not. Consciousness drops out of the explanatory role.\n\n6. Illustrative Cases  \n\n6.1 Linguistic Comprehension  \nYou effortlessly understand the sentence \u201cPolar bears are carnivorous.\u201d The parsing and semantic composition are executed by modules whose principles you cannot state. Nevertheless, if challenged, you could supply sufficient reasons: the speaker just uttered the sentence in your language and is a trustworthy informant, or you recall reading it in a reputable source. The belief is thus based on reasons that are accessible, though the computations remain unconscious. The account accords with common-sense epistemology while rejecting the consciousness requirement.\n\n6.2 Chicken-Sexing Experts  \nProfessional chicken-sexers distinguish male from female chicks with near-perfect accuracy yet cannot explain how. Their competence is honed by feedback; it robustly tracks the sex of chicks via subtle morphological cues. They are entitled to rely on that competence even if they can only say, \u201cIt just looks male.\u201d Their standing capacity for reflection remains: when told the hatchery lighting is deceptive or the chicks have been dyed, they suspend judgment. Conscious justification does not precede every verdict; it arises on demand.\n\n6.3 Blindsight  \nPatients with cortical damage report no conscious visual experience in the scotoma region but reliably guess object location above chance. Are their guesses epistemically justified beliefs? Here the second pillar does crucial work. Because the information is not globally accessible for potential integration, the competence is *fragmentary.* The patient cannot incorporate defeaters nor use the information in broader reasoning. Accordingly, the attitude resembles a reliable reflex rather than an epistemically responsible belief. Lack of conscious availability *does* undermine justification\u2014but only via the integration requirement, not directly.\n\n7. Advantages over Pure Access Internalism and Pure Reliabilism  \n\nCompared to classical access internalism, the Accessible Competence model preserves the internalist insight that subjects bear a distinctive responsibility for their beliefs\u2014yet locates that responsibility in capacities for reflection rather than in constant occurrent monitoring. Compared to unadorned reliabilism, it respects the intuition that a belief formed by a reliable but unintegrated module (e.g., a gypsy\u2019s crystal ball implant) is not fully justified. The hybrid thus captures desiderata from both camps without inflating our phenomenology.\n\n8. Residual Worries  \n\nOne might suspect circularity: the capacity count as \u201ccompetences\u201d only if they typically yield justified beliefs, while justified beliefs are defined by the operation of competences. But the competence notion is fixed extensionally by independent scientific and common-sense markers: stable success across varied conditions, learnability via feedback, and modular decomposition explanatory of performance. These markers ground an external criterion for reliability.\n\nAnother worry targets the integration criterion: must the subject really be able to *articulate* the reasons? Illiterate yet reliable trackers (e.g., certain animals using echolocation) cannot verbalize. The answer is that articulation need not be verbal; what matters is that the information be poised for use in motivation-sensitive control\u2014planning, contradiction resolution, inferential updating. The hallmark is availability to the subject\u2019s general cognitive economy, not linguistic expression.\n\n9. Conclusion  \n\nDoes unconscious reasoning undercut epistemic basing? No. What matters is not whether the reasons light up the theater of consciousness but whether they are processed by competencies that reliably register epistemically relevant features and are suitably integrated with the subject\u2019s capacity for reflective endorsement or revision. Conscious awareness aids justification by providing a venue for defeating and endorsing, yet it is not constitutive of basing. Our everyday epistemic lives depend vitally on fast, automatic modules\u2014from edge detection to syntactic parsing\u2014whose operations rarely surface to attention. To deny them justificatory force would be to render most of our ordinary beliefs unjustified, an unacceptable skepticism. The better lesson is that epistemic responsibility extends beyond the border of the conscious: it resides in the integrated architecture of the person, of which consciousness is a useful\u2014but not indispensable\u2014part.", "output_tokens": 3018, "reasoning_tokens": 320}

Orientation and Thesis  \nWhen I judge that the train is late because the platform clock reads 10:12 and the timetable said 10:05, I can ordinarily cite those reasons.  But many of the states by which we steer our lives lack that transparent pedigree: I swerve before knowing why, prefer one sentence\u2019s grammatical structure over another without articulable grounds, or trust a friend\u2019s statement because of micro-expressions I never noticed.  The question is whether such cases fall outside the realm of genuine epistemic basing because the operative reasons never rose to consciousness.  My thesis is a qualified negative: conscious awareness is not required for a mental state to be based on epistemic reasons, provided (i) the reasons are represented in the agent\u2019s cognitive system in a way that guides the formation or maintenance of the target state, and (ii) the agent is broadly capable, under minimal prompting and without adding new information, of bringing those reasons to conscious awareness.  In short, basing requires \u201cavailability,\u201d not \u201cactual awareness.\u201d  This hybrid view preserves the epistemic significance of modular, automatic processes while vindicating the intuition that justified belief must remain within the subject\u2019s rational control.\n\n2. Conceptual Ground-clearing  \nWe need three distinctions.\n\n(a) Reasons: normative vs. motivating.  Normative reasons are facts that count in favor of a belief; motivating (or explanatory) reasons are the considerations the subject actually relies upon.  Our topic is the motivating sense: what a belief is based on.\n\n(b) Personal vs. sub-personal levels.  Personal-level states are the ones attributed in ordinary psychological explanation (\u201cshe judged,\u201d \u201che noticed\u201d), whereas sub-personal states are the computational or neural states posited by cognitive science.  A modular process such as face-recognition operates largely at the sub-personal level.\n\n(c) Basing vs. just having justification.  A subject might possess evidence that justifies p even if her belief that p is formed for bad reasons (the classic \u201cTrue Detective\u201d case).  Only basing confers the stronger status of doxastic justification.\n\nBecause the target is basing, the awareness theorist must hold that a belief fails to be doxastically justified\u2014indeed is not \u201cepistemically owned\u201d by the agent\u2014unless the considerations that do the causal work are consciously accessible at the moment of belief.\n\n3. The Allure of the Awareness Requirement  \nThree motivations dominate the literature.\n\ni. Transparency.  We ordinarily treat epistemic assessments as subject-directed: ask the agent \u201cwhy?\u201d and expect an answer.  If she cannot articulate any ground, we suspect guesswork or wishful thinking.\n\nii. Epistemic Responsibility.  Responsibility seems to presuppose control.  Because conscious reflection is where reasons are weighed, only awareness-secured basing seems to leave beliefs within the agent\u2019s rational purview.\n\niii. The Sellarsian Manifest Image.  On an influential view (Sellars, McDowell), rational relations belong to the \u201cspace of reasons,\u201d a domain constituted by concepts whose essence is their public articulability.  Sub-personal mechanisms occupy the \u201crealm of law,\u201d incapable of normative force.\n\nTaken together, these points push toward an \u201caccess internalist\u201d constraint: the justificatory elements must be within the subject\u2019s phenomenological grasp.\n\n4. Pressure from Cognitive Science and Ordinary Practice  \nYet the awareness requirement clashes with mounting evidence that good reasoning is frequently unconscious:\n\nA. Perceptual Confidence.  Visual confidence tracks subtle reliability variables\u2014contrast, eccentricity, saccadic suppression\u2014about which ordinary perceivers are entirely unaware.  Their confidence judgments are nevertheless formed on the basis of that information in a statistically appropriate way (Fleming 2017).\n\nB. Linguistic Intuitions.  Speakers swiftly judge a sentence ungrammatical though they cannot state the violated rule.  The modular parser encodes syntactic dependencies sub-personally; conscious access trails far behind.\n\nC. Infant and Animal Cognition.  Preverbal infants and corvids draw sophisticated statistical inferences.  If awareness were necessary for basing, we would have to deny that their conclusions count as epistemically creditable\u2014an unattractive species chauvinism.\n\nD. Clinical Cases.  In blindsight, subjects guess whether a stimulus is present at above-chance rates guided by residual visual information.  The guesses are based on operative reasons (the stimulus\u2019s low-level features) without conscious vision.\n\nIf these beliefs and judgments are not epistemically based, then much of our cognitive success becomes epistemically lucky.  That result is hard to swallow once we notice that the very same inferential patterns, when later articulated in conscious reasoning, inherit no additional justificatory oomph.\n\n5. Towards a Hybrid Account of Basing  \nWe need a middle path that (i) preserves responsible epistemic agency, (ii) reflects the empirical role of unconscious processing, and (iii) blocks deviant causal chains where a belief is accidentally caused by the right kind of fact without being based on it (e.g., the clairvoyant chicken sexer who normally uses visual cues but on Tuesday is struck by lightning which directly implants the belief).\n\nI propose three jointly sufficient conditions for epistemic basing:\n\n1. Representational Condition.  The reason must be encoded in the agent\u2019s cognitive architecture in a content-preserving way; it must stand in a determinate explanatory relation to the target belief.\n\n2. Guidance Condition.  The representation must non-accidentally guide the formation or sustenance of the belief via a psychological mechanism that is (statistically) truth-conducive.\n\n3. Availability Condition.  Were the agent to query herself sincerely (\u201cWhy do I think p?\u201d) under normal attentional circumstances, she would be disposed to bring the relevant consideration (or a close epistemic surrogate) to consciousness without needing new external information.\n\nCondition (3) credits the intuition that reasons are \u201cone thought away,\u201d restoring ownership and responsibility.  Yet it allows the actual basing relation to operate entirely below the threshold of occurrent awareness.  The view thereby escapes the empirical objections from Section 4.\n\n6. Comparative Assessment  \nLet me contrast this hybrid with two extant positions.\n\n(a) Strict Awareness Internalism (SAI): A belief is based on R only if R is consciously tokened at t.  SAI honors transparency but implausibly denies basing to infants, animals, and many human competencies.  The availability condition loosens the grip without abandoning the normative focus on the subject.\n\n(b) Purely Externalist Causalism (PEC): Any reliable causal chain from R to belief suffices for basing, regardless of the agent\u2019s access or dispositions.  PEC accounts for unconscious inference but threatens to ascribe basing in clairvoyant lightning cases where the agent has no capacity to cite R even after reflection.  By adding an availability constraint, we weed out such deviant chains.\n\n7. Illustrative Cases  \nCase 1: Dr. Smith\u2019s Diagnosis.  A seasoned physician glances at a patient and says \u201cKawasaki disease.\u201d  Asked for her reasoning, she at first struggles but then mentions lip swelling, conjunctivitis, and febrile rash\u2014features she had subconsciously integrated.  Conditions (1)\u2013(3) are met: the visual cues are represented; they modulated her diagnostic module; and when questioned she can surface them.  Smith\u2019s belief is epistemically based though momentarily unconscious.\n\nCase 2: The Lucky Clairvoyant.  Dana randomly forms the belief that the Dow will rise because of a brain spasm that happens to be triggered by the real-world event of the market rising.  She cannot, even after reflection, articulate any evidence.  Condition (1) fails (no content-preserving representation of the market data), and condition (3) fails (no disposition to cite a reason).  The belief isn\u2019t based.\n\nCase 3: Blindsight.  Patient GY guesses \u201cvertical line.\u201d  The stimulus orientation is encoded in residual V1 pathways, guiding guess formation.  But when asked for reasons, GY can only shrug: he sincerely reports no basis.  Does this violate availability?  I say yes: blindsight subjects lack the disposition to bring the stimulus representation to awareness.  Thus their guesses, while reliable, are not (fully) epistemically based\u2014explaining why they themselves remain hesitant to rely on them.  The view predicts a gradation: as metacognitive access improves through training, the epistemic standing of such guesses correspondingly rises.\n\n8. Objections and Replies  \nObjection 1: The Availability Condition smuggles in the traditional requirement through the back door.  If a subject can bring a reason to consciousness, why not simply insist she must?  \nReply: Because basing is a diachronic relation.  Moment-to-moment cognition would be paralyzed if every micro-adjustment required contemporaneous consciousness.  The requirement is modal, not actual: consciousness must be within reach, ensuring rational responsibility without incurring the empirically unrealistic burden of constant monitoring.\n\nObjection 2: What about spontaneously formed beliefs, such as perceiving a face as angry?  The average subject cannot articulate the facial geometry underlying her judgment.  Doesn\u2019t availability fail here?  \nReply: She can cite defeasible but epistemically relevant surrogates: \u201cHe looks angry\u2014his eyebrows are drawn, lips pressed.\u201d  Though incomplete, such cited features capture parts of the actual basis and are sufficient for critical discussion (\u201cMaybe that\u2019s just his resting face\u201d).  Availability is satisfied piecemeal, allowing everyday perception to count as rational.\n\nObjection 3: Are we not giving too much up to externalism?  Couldn\u2019t a demon ensure that every time I query, I conjure a misleading pseudo-reason?  \nReply: The Representational and Guidance conditions block this.  The demon\u2019s manipulation would sever the content-preserving link: the purported reason would not genuinely explain the belief\u2019s formation.  At best it explains my self-report, not the belief.\n\n9. Payoffs: Responsibility, Critique, and Growth  \nThe hybrid view offers a principled story of epistemic responsibility.  Because the agent can, on reflection, inspect and contest the operative reasons, she remains the proper target of praise and blame.  Moreover, epistemic critique becomes possible: interlocutors can challenge her articulated grounds, forcing revision when they are found wanting.  Automatic yet accessible processes thereby contribute to the subject\u2019s rational agency rather than undermining it.\n\nThe view also meshes with the developmental trajectory of reasoning.  Young children initially act on statistical cues they cannot articulate; education progressively converts implicit sensitivities into explicit knowledge, expanding the domain of critical control.  The Availability condition treats this as genuine epistemic improvement: more beliefs satisfy (3) in adulthood than in childhood.\n\n10. Broader Implications  \nPhilosophically, the account reconciles the \u201cspace of reasons\u201d with the cognitive sciences.  Normative force attaches at the personal level where availability lives, but sub-personal processes earn rational significance by feeding information up a staircase whose top step is potential avowal.  Nothing mystical is required\u2014just ordinary attentional mechanisms.\n\nMethodologically, the view informs experimental design.  Metacognitive probes should not merely ask \u201cDo you know why?\u201d but test whether reasons can be evoked with minimal cues.  A failure at that level distinguishes blindsight from ordinary vision or expert intuition.\n\nFinally, the hybrid invites a graded understanding of justification.  Because availability can vary in richness and ease, basing (and hence doxastic justification) comes in degrees\u2014mirroring our nuanced, everyday judgments of epistemic performance.\n\n11. Conclusion  \nLack of occurrent awareness does not by itself disqualify a mental state from being epistemically based on the reasons that give it force.  The deep mistake of strict awareness theories is to confuse phenomenological presence with rational ownership.  What matters is that the reasons are in play, guiding cognition via content-preserving pathways, and that the subject stands ready, upon reflective demand, to surface them.  That position honors both our scientific understanding of the mind\u2019s modular underpinnings and our normative commitment to treating beliefs as accountable products of rational agents.  Automaticity without accessibility is epistemically blind; accessibility without automaticity is empty introspection.

Framing the Problem  \n\nMany of our most basic beliefs\u2014e.g. that there is a table before us, that a friend is angry from the pitch of her voice, that the approaching car is accelerating\u2014arise automatically and without introspective fanfare. Cognitive science tells us that perception, language comprehension, and even sophisticated heuristic reasoning are executed by modular, largely encapsulated sub-systems that work below the threshold of conscious awareness. Yet many philosophers (Fumerton, BonJour, Bergmann, and to some extent Conee & Feldman) maintain an Awareness Requirement:\n\n(AWR) For a doxastic attitude S holds toward p to be epistemically based on reason r (and hence have positive epistemic status), S must be consciously aware of r (or at least of a proposition that articulates r).  \n\nIf AWR is right, most of the beliefs that populate our cognitive lives turn out not to be justified\u2014an outcome that looks epistemically disastrous and psychologically implausible. The question, then, is whether lack of conscious awareness really precludes genuine epistemic basing.\n\nI shall argue for a moderate rejection of AWR:  \n\nThesis: Conscious awareness of one\u2019s reasons is sufficient but not necessary for epistemic basing. What is necessary is that the belief-forming process be appropriately sensitive to the evidential relations that constitute the reasons, in a way that is poised for conscious uptake upon critical reflection.\n\nThe argument proceeds as follows. Section 2 clarifies the basing relation and distinguishes three kinds of awareness. Section 3 critiques two main arguments for AWR. Section 4 sketches a process-first account on which unconscious but evidentially sensitive modular processes can ground justification. Section 5 anticipates and answers four objections, and Section 6 draws the upshot for epistemology more broadly.\n\n2. Disentangling Basing and Awareness  \n\n2.1. The basing relation  \nTo say that S\u2019s belief that p is based on r is to say (i) S possesses r in some epistemically relevant way; (ii) r stands in the appropriate evidential relation to p (support, explanatory connection, probabilification, etc.); and (iii) that relation explains, in the right way, why S believes p. Conditions (i)\u2013(iii) leave open whether possession and explanation must be conscious.\n\n2.2. Three grades of awareness  \nA failure to disaggregate \u201cawareness\u201d fuels much of the debate.\n\nA-consciousness: occurrent introspective access\u2014S is presently entertaining r, deployable for explicit inference or verbal report.  \nD-consciousness: dispositional availability upon reflection\u2014if prompted, S could in short order retrieve or articulate r.  \nN-representation: non-conscious subpersonal representation of r within some cognitive module.\n\nAWR is plausible if it demands only A-consciousness; less plausible if D-consciousness suffices; and arguably false if mere N-representation can do epistemic work. My view is that basing requires at least N-representation and normally D-consciousness, but not A-consciousness. Sometimes, even D may fail\u2014think of the infant or expert chicken sexer\u2014yet the epistemic standing is not thereby forfeited.\n\n3. Against the Awareness Requirement  \n\n3.1. The regress argument  \nAdvocates of AWR often rely on the Regress of Reasons: if S is not aware of r, then r cannot justify p for S; but if r* justifies r, S must be aware of r*, and so on ad infinitum. The game is won only if one assumes the following principle:\n\n(Internal Access) For r to justify p for S, S must have occurrent reflective access to the fact that r supports p.\n\nYet the regress dissolves once we deny Internal Access. Reasons can stand in support relations whether or not the subject explicitly represents those relations. Cognitive science abundantly documents mundane non-conscious inferences (Bayesian updating in vision, Gricean implicature in conversation). To insist that justification evaporates absent explicit awareness is to legislate, not argue.\n\n3.2. The de-personalization worry  \nA second argument claims that if justification can accrue via subpersonal modules, epistemic appraisal loses its essentially personal character; it is my belief, not my visual system\u2019s, that is justified or not. But the inference from \u201csubpersonal process contributes\u201d to \u201cthe person is not the proper bearer of justification\u201d is a non-sequitur. Persons are constituted by biological and computational sub-systems. Virtues and vices of automatic perception are attributable to the person insofar as those sub-systems are integrated into her overall cognitive architecture and responsive to epistemic evaluation (training, correction, critical reflection). The basing relation can therefore be mediated by subpersonal computation without \u201cde-personalizing\u201d epistemology.\n\n4. A Process-First Account of Unconscious Basing  \n\nBorrowing insights from proper-function reliabilism (Plantinga, Goldman) and Williamson\u2019s knowledge-first epistemology, we can articulate a hybrid view:\n\nProcess-First Basing (PFB):  \nS\u2019s doxastic attitude toward p is epistemically based on r iff  \n(a) r is represented (A, D, or N) within S\u2019s cognitive system;  \n(b) r and p are processed by a mechanism M whose normal (proper) function is to track the evidential relation between r and p;  \n(c) M\u2019s operation in S\u2019s actual environment is non-deviant and reliable relative to that evidential relation;  \n(d) the outputs of M are available for higher-level endorsement or defeat were S to reflect.\n\nClause (d) secures the person-level ownership of justification, while (a)\u2013(c) allow unconscious processing to play justificatory roles. The view is intentionally disjunctive about the mode of representation: A-conscious awareness is one way, but not the only way, for r to be present.\n\n4.1. How PFB vindicates modular justification  \nConsider the M\u00fcller-Lyer illusion. The perceptual module outputs \u201csegment A is longer than segment B,\u201d despite equal lengths. Because the module is systematically misled in that stimulus class, its output is unreliable; clause (c) withholds justification. Now consider ordinary perception of depth under full illumination. The same module tracks environmental regularities. The resulting belief \u201cthere is a table\u201d is justified even though S seldom rehearses premises about angle of light, binocular disparity, etc. What matters is M\u2019s functioning, not S\u2019s current phenomenology.\n\n5. Objections and Replies  \n\nObjection 1: The phenomenology of reason-giving. Intuitively, a belief feels epistemically responsible only when we can cite our grounds. Answer: The datum shows that A-conscious awareness is one salient path to epistemic responsibility, especially in critical contexts. But from \u201cX is salient\u201d it does not follow that \u201conly X confers justification.\u201d Consider your trust in your own color vision when sorting socks in dim light; no phenomenology of inference is present, but the justification stands unless you learn of distorting conditions.\n\nObjection 2: The Generality Problem revived. If justification hinges on reliability of process M, which level of description is the relevant \u201cprocess\u201d? Reply: Clause (b) appeals to proper function, a teleological property that fixes the relevant kind: the function of object-tracking vision, not of \u201cbeing a computational process on day t at time u.\u201d Teleology, grounded in evolutionary and learning histories, solves the reference class indeterminacy.\n\nObjection 3: Alien subpersonal intervention. Suppose a brain implant feeds me true beliefs via inscrutable subroutines. Integration condition (d) fails; the implant\u2019s outputs bypass the critical faculties and cannot be reflectively endorsed. Hence they are not justified, supporting PFB rather than undermining it.\n\nObjection 4: The Pragmatic Encroachment Worry. If justification can accrue unconsciously, subjects may be epistemically blameless while acting on unreliable hunches in high-stakes settings. But PFB already distinguishes justificatory status from pragmatic rationality; being allowed to act on p requires more than minimal justification, perhaps knowledge or practical adequacy. The account, therefore, leaves room for encroachment without binding it to the basing relation itself.\n\n6. Epistemological Payoffs  \n\n6.1. Perception and basic knowledge  \nTraditional foundationalism treats perceptual beliefs as non-inferentially basic. PFB refines that view: perceptual belief is inferential in the sense of being produced by evidentially sensitive computations, but basic in that the subject need not be aware of the underlying inference. We retain what is attractive about foundationalism\u2014non-regressive justification\u2014without postulating brute epistemic primitives.\n\n6.2. Expert intuition and skill  \nConsider the master chess player\u2019s \u201cseems-right\u201d move choice or the firefighter\u2019s hurried exit before a structure collapses (Klein). These intuitions track subtle environmental regularities. On AWR, such beliefs would lack justification unless the expert can articulate the grounds, but that verdict is counterintuitive: the expert is precisely the agent we trust. PFB vindicates this trust while explaining the learning and feedback mechanisms that confer reliability.\n\n6.3. Cognitive enhancement  \nAs augmented reality and AI assistants integrate into our cognitive lives, the basing relation must accommodate hybrid human-machine processes. PFB\u2019s emphasis on proper function and integration offers a normative framework for evaluating whether new cognitive prostheses genuinely enhance justification or merely insert gadgetry.\n\n7. Why the Appeal of AWR Persists  \n\nAWR resonates because epistemic evaluation is often dialogical: we ask others, \u201cWhy do you think that?\u201d Failure to cite reasons is a social defeater. But conversational contexts impose higher transparency demands than the metaphysics of justification itself. A child or non-philosopher may be unable to articulate probabilistic principles yet remain epistemically justified. Recognizing this distinction respects both the social norm and the cognitive reality.\n\n8. Conclusion  \n\nLack of occurrent consciousness does not preclude a doxastic attitude from being epistemically based on reasons. What matters is that the subject\u2019s cognitive architecture registers and processes those reasons in a way that is functionally evidential and, if needed, available for conscious scrutiny. Awareness is a privileged but not exclusive gateway to justificatory status. Rejecting the Awareness Requirement preserves the epistemic worth of our richly automatic cognitive lives while continuing to hold agents responsible through reflection, correction, and learning\u2014a reconciliation truer both to science and to everyday epistemic practice.", "output_tokens": 2604, "reasoning_tokens": 320}

Introduction: why objectivity and trust come apart\n\nPhilosophers now widely agree that the word \u2018objective\u2019 functions like a promissory note: to call a result objective is to suggest that others may rely on it.  Arthur Fine\u2019s slogan that \u201cobjectivity is just the name of the trust we place in science\u201d and Heather Douglas\u2019 proposal that objectivity is \u201ca signal of trustworthiness\u201d capture an important insight.  Yet the identification is too quick.  Trust is an attitude we adopt; objectivity is (or purports to be) a property of a claim, a procedure, or a body of evidence.  We can trust where we should not (the history of fraud and error in science shows as much), and we can enjoy genuine objectivity without any public trust (think of an unpopular result that later proves correct).  So the relationship is neither equivalence nor simple entailment in either direction.\n\nI shall argue for a more precise account.\n\nThesis: The different senses of scientific objectivity\u2014procedural, convergent, and interactive\u2014are unified by the single epistemic property of perspective\u2010robustness: a result is objective to the extent that it is stable under a systematic widening of viewpoints.  Perspective\u2010robustness simultaneously (i) provides epistemic warrant for trusting the result and (ii) supplies practical instructions about how that warrant may be checked.  \u2018Objectivity\u2019 therefore names the ground of justified trust, not trust itself.  Trust is a second-order attitude we are licensed to adopt when perspective-robustness has been achieved.\n\nThe plan is as follows.  (\u00a72) I briefly unpack the three senses of objectivity at stake.  (\u00a73) I analyse \u2018trust\u2019 and show why its conflation with objectivity generates conceptual trouble.  (\u00a74) I develop and defend the notion of perspective-robustness and show how it unifies the three senses.  (\u00a75) I illustrate the account with two concrete cases.  (\u00a76) I answer four likely objections.  (\u00a77) I close by drawing methodological morals for philosophers of science and for public science communication.\n\n2. Three familiar faces of objectivity\n\n1. Procedural objectivity: coined by Daston and Galison, it is the virtue we seek when we rigidly follow standardised, mechanical, or algorithmic procedures: the 19th-century use of self-registering instruments, double-blind randomised trials, or contemporary machine processing of satellite images.  The idea is to limit the influence of personal idiosyncrasy by outsourcing judgment to procedure.\n\n2. Convergent objectivity: the feature highlighted by philosophers such as Boyd and Salmon\u2014independent lines of evidence converge on the same result.  When several labs, using different instruments and experimental set-ups, obtain the same cross\u2010section for the Higgs boson, or when ice cores, dendrochronology, and ocean sediments converge on a single palaeoclimate curve, we speak of objectivity.\n\n3. Interactive objectivity: defended by Longino, Douglas, and others.  Critical interaction among diverse investigators, guided by normative rules of discourse, detects and filters out subjective bias.  The locus of objectivity is in the social practice that exposes claims to criticism.\n\nThese modes differ in emphasis\u2014machine discipline, empirical convergence, critical discourse\u2014but they all promise something a single inquirer cannot attain unaided: a result insulated from one person\u2019s contingent perspective.\n\n3. What kind of thing is trust?\n\n\u2018Trust\u2019 in ordinary language is an attitude someone (the truster) adopts toward an agent or process (the trustee) with respect to some domain of action, under conditions of uncertainty and vulnerability.  Trust has three notable features:\n\na) It is essentially relational and agential.  We trust someone (or something) to do something.\n\nb) It involves risk: the truster is vulnerable if the trustee fails.\n\nc) It is a psychological stance: one can mistakenly trust, or refuse to trust, regardless of objective facts.\n\nBecause trust is an attitude, it can outrun warrant.  I may trust an unreliable mechanic or distrust a perfectly competent one.\n\nObjectivity, by contrast, is a proposed epistemic property.  We certify claims, tools, or procedures as objective so that any rational agent ought to trust them.  Confusing the warrant with the attitude collapses two normative layers: (i) is the claim worth trusting? and (ii) do we in fact trust it?  The Fine/Douglas slogan collapses these layers.  The cost is theoretical imprecision and practical impotence: without an account of what makes trust warranted we cannot diagnose misplaced public suspicion or na\u00efve credulity.\n\n4. Perspective-robustness: the missing unifier\n\n4.1  The guiding idea\n\nStart with a minimal epistemological insight: any individual\u2019s cognitive access to the world is partial, filtered through idiosyncratic sensory apparatus, background assumptions, and social location.  A method or result earns the honorific \u2018objective\u2019 to the extent that it remains stable when we view it through additional, alternative perspectives.  If shifting from manual eyeball counts to automated image analysis, from male labs in Chicago to female labs in Kyoto, from barometers to satellite altimetry, from Western analytic frameworks to Indigenous ecological knowledge, makes no systematic difference to the claim at issue, the claim is robust across perspectives.  Perspective-robustness is therefore a modal property: invariance under specified transformations of epistemic viewpoint.\n\n4.2  How the three senses instantiate the concept\n\nProcedural objectivity: robustness achieved by substituting mechanical, rule-guided perspectives for discretionary judgment.  A standard operating protocol represents an imagined class of alternative operators.  The claim is valid no matter which trained technician runs the assay.\n\nConvergent objectivity: robustness via evidential triangulation.  Each independent measurement technique offers a distinct epistemic perspective; their agreement after transformation into a common representational idiom signals invariance.\n\nInteractive objectivity: robustness via critical uptake of socially diverse standpoints.  Peer review, replication attempts, and adversarial collaboration probe whether the result depends on one limited cultural or theoretical lens.\n\nThus the three senses are not disparate virtues but complementary strategies for approximating the same modal ideal.\n\n4.3  From robustness to warranted trust\n\nWhy should perspective-robustness license trust?  Because it lowers epistemic risk in a principled way.  When a claim survives perspective shifts chosen precisely to expose potential distortions, the probability that it is an artefact of those distortions drops.  Rational agents sensitive to their own fallibility are therefore permitted\u2014indeed required\u2014to trust such a claim more than alternatives that have not survived comparable tests.  In slogan form:\n\nObjectivity = Robustness under perspective shifts \u2192 Epistemic reliability \u2192 Justified trust.\n\nTrust enters at the level of rational response to demonstrated reliability, not as the definiens of objectivity.\n\n5. Two illustrative cases\n\nCase 1: Global mean surface temperature (GMST)\n\nProcedural angle: The raw thermometer readings are adjusted by a transparent, algorithmic homogenisation procedure that corrects for station moves and instrument changes.\n\nConvergent angle: Satellite microwave sounding, sea-surface buoys, and reanalysis models yield congruent warming trends.\n\nInteractive angle: Teams at NASA-GISS, Hadley/CRU, and Berkeley Earth openly share code and invite independent re-analysis; critics such as the \u2018luke\u2010warmist\u2019 group repeatedly scrutinise choices about urban heat-island corrections.\n\nResult: Across instruments, statistical models, and investigator allegiances, the upward trend persists.  The GMST series is perspective-robust, and therefore a rational public is warranted in trusting its upward slope despite waves of political scepticism.\n\nCase 2: The op-amp in neurophysiology\n\nHodgkin and Huxley\u2019s voltage-clamp (1952) used a feedback amplifier\u2014then an engineering novelty\u2014to hold neuron membranes at fixed voltage.  Skeptics worried that the feedback could itself create artefactual currents.\n\nProcedural check: The amplifier-builder\u2019s documentation about bandwidth and phase lag imposed strict construction tolerances.\n\nConvergent check: Independent labs varied electrode geometry and salinity yet reproduced the same current\u2013voltage curves.\n\nInteractive check: Biophysicists and electrical engineers, with different disciplinary lenses, co-authored critique-and-response papers.\n\nOnly after all three angles withstood scrutiny did the ionic basis of the action potential become textbook knowledge.  The community\u2019s trust was earned, not presumed.\n\n6. Four objections answered\n\nObjection 1 (Standpoint epistemologist): Perspective-robustness privileges dominant perspectives; marginalised voices are still excluded.\n\nReply: The framework demands widening of perspectives, not their suppression.  The diagnostic question becomes empirical: were relevant standpoint transformations attempted?  Feminist critiques of androcentric primatology, for instance, demonstrated novel phenomena (female dominance hierarchies) precisely by adding previously ignored observational perspectives\u2014thereby increasing perspective-robustness.\n\nObjection 2 (Underdetermination): Multiple theories can survive perspective shift; objectivity cannot adjudicate.\n\nReply: Robustness is a gradational metric.  Competing theories that make empirically equivalent predictions may differ in robustness to, say, explanatory unification or modal testing (novel predictions).  Where perfect tie persists, withholding full trust is rational; but that is not a defect in the concept of objectivity\u2014merely an honest acknowledgement of epistemic limits.\n\nObjection 3 (Algorithmic bias): Procedures thought to ensure robustness can encode hidden bias (e.g., facial recognition misclassifying darker skin tones).\n\nReply: Exactly.  Robustness is achieved only when the set of perspective shifts includes those that reveal such algorithmic vulnerabilities.  Once failures are detected\u2014say, by testing across demographic variation\u2014procedural objectivity is lost until the algorithm is retrained.  The framework thus explains why appeals to \u201cobjective algorithms\u201d ring hollow when robustness checks are incomplete.\n\nObjection 4 (Pragmatist): Science aims at successful action, not perspective-invariance.\n\nReply: Perspective-robustness is not rival to pragmatist success; it is a proxy for cross-context reliability, the very quality that enables successful action under varying conditions.  The notions align rather than compete.\n\n7. Closing morals\n\n1. Conceptual clarity: \u2018Objectivity\u2019 in science is best analysed as perspective-robustness; this single property underwrites the procedural, convergent, and interactive senses.\n\n2. Epistemic layering: Trust is a downstream attitude made rational by demonstrated robustness.  Detaching the two notions lets us explain both misplaced trust (robustness absent) and unwarranted scepticism (robustness present).\n\n3. Methodological guidance: When a controversy erupts, ask \u201cWhich relevant perspectives have yet to be brought to bear?\u201d  This turns sociological diversity and methodological plurality into epistemic resources, not threats.\n\n4. Communication payoff: Scientists should advertise not merely that a result is \u2018objective\u2019 but how it achieved perspective-robustness.  Lay audiences then see the link between robust method and warranted trust, reducing the gap that post-truth rhetoric exploits.\n\nBy sharpening the relation between objectivity and trust in this way, we neither mystify science with a vague honorific nor reduce it to psychological attitude.  We instead locate the rational core of scientific credibility in a public, inspectable feature: the stability of claims under widening circles of perspective.  That, I submit, is the sense in which objectivity remains both possible and indispensable.", "output_tokens": 2897, "reasoning_tokens": 448}

But when philosophers such as Arthur Fine and Heather Douglas equate objectivity with trust tout court, the equation is too quick. \u201cTrust\u201d is an attitude that people have; \u201cobjectivity,\u201d if it is anything, is a property of epistemic products and the practices that produce them.  To see the real relationship between the two, we need (i) a more articulated picture of what epistemic trust amounts to, (ii) an inventory of the different kinds of objectivity at work in science, and (iii) a bridge principle explaining how each kind of objectivity secures the norms of trustworthy belief.  My thesis is the following:\n\nThesis\u2002Scientific objectivity is best understood as a cluster of practice-level features that make the epistemic products of science *trustworthy for a public of inquirers*, where \u201ctrustworthy\u201d means that the products are (a) reliably linked to the truth-makers they purport to represent, (b) publicly checkable by suitably placed critics, and (c) socially accountable to those affected by their adoption.  \u201cTrust\u201d is thus not identical to objectivity; it is the warranted attitude made rational by the presence of these features.  What unifies the many senses of objectivity\u2014procedural, convergent, interactive, and so on\u2014is that each one secures one or more of (a)\u2013(c).  Different senses spotlight different failure modes (bias, arbitrariness, opacity), but all aim at the same underlying profile of trustworthiness.\n\nThe argument proceeds in five steps.\n\n1. Distinguish trust from trustworthiness.  \n2. Diagnose four generic risks that make trust in science defeasible.  \n3. Show how the canonical senses of objectivity map onto those risks.  \n4. Demonstrate unity: \u201cobjective\u201d means \u201cpossessing sufficient safeguards against all four risks so that a public can rationally repose trust.\u201d  \n5. Address objections that this model is either too social or not social enough.\n\nI. Trust vs. Trustworthiness  \nPhilosophers of testimony (e.g., Hardwig, Origgi, Faulkner) reserve \u201ctrust\u201d for the *attitude* A has toward B when A relies on B\u2019s word while accepting the vulnerability that reliance entails.  \u201cTrustworthiness,\u201d by contrast, is a property of B: B is trustworthy just in case B meets certain normative conditions\u2014typically reliability, competence, sincerity, and accountability\u2014such that A\u2019s reliance is reasonable.\n\nScientific objectivity, if equated with trust itself, would be an attitude, which cannot be right: a paper in *Nature* may be objective even when ignored, and charismatic frauds may be trusted despite lack of objectivity.  More plausibly, objectivity is one dimension of trustworthiness, or better, a *constellation* of dimensions aimed at insuring the public that their epistemic vulnerability is not being exploited.  The philosopher\u2019s task, then, is to explicate what those dimensions are.\n\nII. Four Risks That Undermine Epistemic Trust  \nWhy is trust in science ever in doubt?  I suggest four generic risks\u2014each a possible disconnect between a scientific representation and its truth-maker or between the practice and its social guardians.  They are:\n\nR1. Idiosyncrasy: the result depends on the quirks of individual investigators rather than on the phenomenon.  \nR2. Arbitrariness: the result is not robust under changes of method or perspective.  \nR3. Opacity: the derivation of the result is sufficiently hidden that critics cannot check it without prohibitive cost.  \nR4. Unaccountability: when errors matter socially, there is no mechanism for redress or correction.\n\nIf an epistemic product neutralizes R1\u2013R4, then laypersons and scientists alike can reasonably trust it.  The familiar varieties of objectivity can now be seen as specialized antidotes to these risks.\n\nIII. Mapping the Varieties of Objectivity onto the Risks  \n\n1. Procedural Objectivity (anti-R1)  \nProcedural objectivity, prominent in nineteenth-century metrology and in modern clinical trials, mandates standardized protocols that eliminate the need for individual judgment at critical junctures.  Witness the use of double-blind randomization in drug testing.  By stripping investigators\u2019 personal biases and perceptual quirks from the data-generating step, procedurally objective methods underwrite *inter-operator reproducibility.*  The epistemic gain is immunity to Idiosyncrasy (R1).\n\n2. Concordant or Convergent Objectivity (anti-R2)  \nConvergent objectivity, associated with Neurath, Peirce, and more recently Wimsatt\u2019s robustness analysis, requires that a claim be supported by multiple independent lines of evidence that would likely fail in different ways if the claim were false.  Example: the reality of gravitational waves enjoys support from laser interferometry, pulsar timing arrays, and general-relativistic binary pulse-decay measurements.  Divergent methods converging on the same quantity insulate the claim against Arbitrariness (R2), because no single methodological idiosyncrasy can explain the agreement.\n\n3. Interactive Objectivity (anti-R3)  \nHeather Douglas\u2019s \u201cinteractive\u201d or \u201ccritical\u201d objectivity focuses on the institutionalized back-and-forth of criticism\u2014peer review, replication attempts, adversarial collaboration.  The point is not merely multiple perspectives but their *structured interaction*, ensuring that potentially biasing value-judgments surface early and can be contested.  A landmark case is the open, realtime release of LIGO data for cross-analysis by independent theorists, rendering the inferential chain transparent and thus reducing Opacity (R3).\n\n4. Social or Civic Objectivity (anti-R4)  \nMore recent STS literature (e.g., Longino\u2019s \u201ctransformative criticism,\u201d Kitcher\u2019s \u201cwell-ordered science\u201d) stresses accountability to stakeholders.  Where scientific outputs bear directly on public welfare\u2014think of EPA particulate standards\u2014objectivity demands participatory mechanisms so that affected parties can challenge assumptions and monitor for conflicts of interest.  This dimension counters Unaccountability (R4).\n\nWhat unifies these varieties is neither procedural sameness nor value\u2010freeness; it is that each plugs a distinct epistemic or social gap that would otherwise make trust irrational.\n\nIV. A Unified Account: Dependable Independence  \nYet we still lack a single, precise formula.  I propose:\n\nAn epistemic product P of a community S is objective to degree \u03b1 just in case P\u2019s truth-value is *dependably independent* of the idiosyncratic states of any particular agent or faction in S, and S has made that independence *publicly checkable and socially accountable*.\n\n\u201cDependably independent\u201d conjoins two ideas:\n\n(1)  Independence: P is not a mere echo of private interests, perceptual quirks, or local methodological choices.  \n(2)  Dependability: The causal-epistemic pathway from phenomenon to claim is stable; deviations would be detected by S\u2019s monitoring structures.\n\nPublic checkability and accountability import the social dimensions needed to close R3\u2013R4.\n\nWhere do the canonical senses slot in?  \n\n\u2022 Procedural objectivity guarantees agent-independence by rigid standardization.  \n\u2022 Convergent objectivity adds pathway-dependability through cross-method robustness.  \n\u2022 Interactive objectivity operationalizes public checkability.  \n\u2022 Civic objectivity secures social accountability.\n\nThe \u201cdependably independent\u201d model thus unifies without collapsing distinctions: each sense specifies necessary but not sufficient conditions for full objectivity.  Trust becomes rational once an audience has positive evidence that *all* dimensions are in place for the claim at hand.\n\nV. Objections and Replies  \n\nObjection 1: Too Social.  Science often achieves objectivity in the solitude of a single lab, well before public scrutiny or stakeholder involvement.  Doesn\u2019t the account overstate the social?  \nReply: Note the phrase \u201cto degree \u03b1.\u201d  A first-pass, lab-internal replication may supply modest objectivity\u2014enough for insiders\u2019 tentative reliance\u2014but the public is entitled to higher degrees when lives or large sums are at stake.  The framework scales: additional dimensions of independence and visibility kick in as the circle of reliance widens.\n\nObjection 2: Not Social Enough.  Feminist epistemologists argue that certain standpoints (e.g., women in male-dominated fields) have privileged access to aspects of reality.  Objectivity, they say, is not independence from perspective but the systematic *inclusion of marginalized perspectives.*  Does \u201cdependable independence\u201d ignore this?  \nReply: Inclusion is precisely what delivers independence in my sense.  If a community excludes standpoints, its evidential pathways are *dependently* tied to the dominant group\u2019s blind spots.  Insuring representation is not an alternative to independence; it is a precondition of it.\n\nObjection 3: Reduction to Reliability.  Why not skip the social bells and whistles and say that objectivity just is high statistical reliability?  \nReply: Reliability is necessary but not sufficient.  Imagine a pharmaceutical company discovers a blockbuster drug via impeccably reliable methods but locks the raw data behind NDAs, refusing independent audit.  Reliability obtains; trust among outsiders does not.  Objectivity, precisely because it is meant to license trust across epistemic boundaries, must include warrants that are publicly demonstrable.\n\nObjection 4: The Regress of Trust.  If objectivity only secures trust by being publicly checkable, doesn\u2019t that push the problem back a step\u2014why trust the public checks?  \nReply: Checks are typically lower-stakes and more modular than the claim they vet.  A climate model may be beyond my skill to assess, but I can understand the audit\u2010trail conventions and error-budget disclosures that accompany it.  Trust terminates, not in infinite regress, but in norms of transparency that are themselves monitorable with minimal expertise (e.g., whether data are posted online).\n\nVI. Illustrative Cases  \n\nCase 1: Historical Temperature Reconstructions  \nReconstructing past temperatures from Antarctic ice cores has to neutralize: R1 (idiosyncrasies of drilling teams), R2 (method-specific artifacts like isotopic fractionation), R3 (complex statistical massaging), R4 (policy stakes on emissions targets).  Procedural standardization (core cleaning protocols) tackles R1; multiple proxies (isotopic O-18, deuterium, trapped gas ratios) target R2; open data repositories battle R3; and bodies such as the IPCC, with its multi-nation review process, address R4.  The resulting objectivity is why laypersons can rationally trust claims about Pleistocene climate without becoming geochemists.\n\nCase 2: The 2015 Discovery of Gravitational Waves  \nLIGO\u2019s first detection required millisecond-precision instruments notoriously sensitive to truck traffic and seismic noise.  Procedural objectivity controlled for local disturbances via automated vetoes; convergent objectivity came from coincidence detection across two sites 3,000 km apart; interactive objectivity surfaced when data and pipelines were shared with theorists who identified potential confounding glitches; civic objectivity emerged in NSF\u2019s obligation to release findings given public funding.  The cocktail of safeguards turned a statistical blip into a Nobel-winning discovery that taxpayers and physicists alike could trust.\n\nCase 3: CRISPR Gene-Editing Moratoria  \nHere the phenomenon is still partially unknown (off-target effects), but decisions about germline editing cannot wait.  Procedural objectivity is embryonic; convergent evidence is thin; interactive objectivity is compromised by commercial secrecy; civic oversight is hotly debated.  Accordingly, the epistemic product\u2014claims of \u201cacceptable risk\u201d\u2014is not yet trustworthy.  The moratoria instantiate the rational withholding of trust until objectivity\u2019s full array is in place.\n\nVII. Payoffs and Up-shots  \n\n1. Clarifies Debates: When scientists talk past one another on objectivity\u2014say, during policy hearings\u2014we can ask: which risk (R1\u2013R4) are you addressing?  \n2. Resolves Tensions: Value-laden science becomes compatible with objectivity once we see that proper value management (through interactive critique) is a safeguard, not a contaminant.  \n3. Guides Practice: Funding agencies can audit research proposals for independence dimensions (e.g., require data-sharing plans to curb R3).  \n4. Frames Public Communication: Rather than urging the public to \u201ctrust science,\u201d communicators can articulate the concrete safeguards whose presence underwrites that trust, thereby reducing epistemic polarization.\n\nVIII. Conclusion  \n\nObjectivity and trust are siblings, not twins.  Trust is the normative attitude: a readiness to rely while vulnerable.  Objectivity is the property of scientific outputs and processes that *earns* that attitude by establishing dependable independence\u2014independence from private idiosyncrasy, methodological arbitrariness, informational opacity, and social unaccountability.  Each classical sense of objectivity we inherit from the philosophical taxonomy is a specialized safeguard against one of these vulnerabilities.  What unifies them is the function they jointly serve: to render rational a public posture of epistemic trust toward the products of science.  This account is more precise than the bare slogan \u201cobjectivity = trust\u201d because it distinguishes (i) the psychological attitude from (ii) the institutional and methodological conditions that warrant it, maps those conditions onto identifiable risks, and offers a scalable metric\u2014degree \u03b1\u2014to measure how far any given scientific claim travels along the road from provisional insight to trustworthy public knowledge.", "output_tokens": 3171, "reasoning_tokens": 320}

Introduction and Statement of Thesis  \n\nArthur Fine\u2019s \u201cNOA\u201d (Natural Ontological Attitude) and Heather Douglas\u2019s recent work on the epistemic\u2010moral entanglements of science both suggest that to call a result \u201cobjective\u201d is, at bottom, to say that it can be trusted.  That remark is not wrong, but it is too thin to illuminate why very different senses of objectivity\u2014procedural, convergent, interactive, measurement, modal, etc.\u2014all get to wear the same honorific.  \n\nMy contention is that \u201ctrust\u201d is not the basis of objectivity but the upshot of a deeper, common functional core.  In every register, objectivity is the systematic mitigation of idiosyncratic epistemic risk\u2014precisely those risks introduced by an agent\u2019s restricted standpoint, interests, or cognitive equipment.  A claim, method, or instrument is objective to the degree that it is invariant under a relevant class of perspective\u2010changes.  Because the relevant risks have been neutralized, any competent participant is warranted in relying on the product, and so trust becomes rationally defensible.  Thus:\n\nThesis: All varieties of scientific objectivity are unified by a single function\u2014 they furnish epistemic outputs that are robust under the elimination, balancing, or public exposure of standpoint\u2010specific distortions.  Trust is an epistemic attitude made possible by that robustness, not its conceptual source.\n\nThe balance of the essay defends this thesis in six steps.\n\n2. A Brief Cartography of \u201cObjectivity\u201d  \n\nThe objectivity literature is a Molinari\u2019s wheel of overlapping senses; three families dominate.\n\nA. Procedural (or \u201cmechanical\u201d) objectivity  \n   Standardized protocols and instruments reduce discretion: think of photographic plates in 19th\u2010century astronomy, double\u2010blind randomization in clinical trials, or automated sequencing machines.\n\nB. Convergent (or \u201cconsensus\u201d) objectivity  \n   Independently varied routes to the same result lend credibility.  When diverse lines of evidence (tectonic, paleomagnetic, fossil) converge on continental drift, the theory earns the badge of objectivity.\n\nC. Interactive (\u201ccritical\u201d or \u201csocial\u201d) objectivity  \n   Objectivity inheres in institutions of criticism\u2014peer review, replication, open\u2010data policies\u2014that continuously expose results to informed challenge.\n\nThese modes look heterogeneous.  What binds them together?\n\n3. Why \u201cTrust\u201d Won\u2019t Do the Unificatory Work  \n\nThe slogan \u201cobjective = can be trusted\u201d fails on four fronts.\n\n(1) Vicious circularity:  We trust because the thing is objective; calling it objective because we trust begs the question.  \n\n(2) Missing direction of explanation:  One can trust for bad reasons (wishful thinking, halo effects).  Objectivity is supposed to certify good reasons.\n\n(3) Variable profile:  I may trust a field geologist\u2019s eye in the field but not her eye for funding ethics.  \u201cTrust,\u201d being attitudinal and scalar, does not map neatly onto the binary honorific of \u201cobjective.\u201d\n\n(4) Third\u2010party evaluability:  Objectivity is meant to license public endorsement.  My private readiness to trust gives no such license.\n\nThus, if Fine and Douglas are onto something, \u201ctrust\u201d is not the explanans but the explanandum: we seek an account of objectivity that shows why trust is warranted.\n\n4. Perspective\u2010Independence as the Functional Core  \n\nStart from a mundane fact: science is a massively distributed epistemic enterprise (Hardwig 1985).  No individual can master all data, techniques, or analytical tools.  Epistemic dependence on others is therefore inevitable.  But dependence is perilous: others may be biased, careless, self\u2010interested, or simply error\u2010prone.  The function of objectivity is to domesticate that peril.\n\nCall an epistemic risk idiosyncratic when it arises from factors peculiar to a limited standpoint\u2014one person\u2019s perceptual quirks, one lab\u2019s contamination, one disciplinary dogma.  The primary design\u2010requirement of objectivity is: neutralize those standpoint-specific risks.  There are three generic engineering solutions:\n\n(i) Elimination:  remove the standpoint altogether (e.g., automate measurement).  \n(ii) Balancing:  counteract one standpoint with others (e.g., politically diverse review panels).  \n(iii) Exposure:  render the standpoint visible so that its influence can be discounted (e.g., disclose funding sources).\n\nThe solutions correspond neatly to our three families:\n\n\u2022 Procedural objectivity eliminates discretion.  \n\u2022 Convergent objectivity balances independent methods.  \n\u2022 Interactive objectivity exposes claims to critical interrogation.\n\nThus, despite surface diversity, each variety implements the same function of perspective\u2010neutralization.\n\n5. A More Precise Model: Invariance Under Perspective\u2010Transformations  \n\nWe can formalize the idea.  Let S be the set of relevant epistemic standpoints (individuals, labs, theoretical frameworks).  A procedure P qualifies as objective with respect to domain D just in case the outcome of applying P to D is invariant under the substitution of any element of S for any other, modulo tolerances \u03b5 fixed by the inquiry\u2019s purpose.  Symbolically:\n\nObjective(P, D, S, \u03b5)  \u2194  \u2200s\u2081, s\u2082 \u2208 S: |P(D, s\u2081) \u2212 P(D, s\u2082)| \u2264 \u03b5.\n\nThis schema captures:\n\n\u2022 Mechanical measurement: replacing technician A with technician B (or even removing the technician) changes the reading by \u2264 \u03b5.  \n\u2022 Convergent evidence: substituting radar data for telescopic observations yields the same orbital parameters within error bounds.  \n\u2022 Critical interaction: after subjecting claim C to rival standpoints, any residual disagreement is at noise level \u03b5.\n\nThe formal statement foregrounds what unites the cases: invariance under standpoint substitution.  \u201cTrust\u201d drops out of the definiens; it reappears in the pragmatic upshot: when invariance holds, downstream users may rationally rely on the result.\n\n6. How the Account Explains the Empirical Landscape  \n\nThe invariance\u2010cum\u2010risk-mitigation view clarifies several ongoing debates.\n\n6.1  Measurement and the \u201cTheory\u2010Ladenness\u201d Worry  \nInstruments are theory\u2010laden, so how can they confer objectivity?  Answer:  not by being theory\u2010free but by ensuring that variation in background theory does not produce variation beyond \u03b5 in reported quantity.  Calibration chains, cross\u2010checking, and sensitivity analyses are all ways of screening off theory idiosyncrasies.\n\n6.2  The Replication Crisis  \nWhen psychological studies fail to replicate, what collapses is not \u201ctrust\u201d per se but the invariance condition: exchanging labs or populations yields large divergences.  The call for pre-registration, open materials, and larger samples are all devices aimed at re\u2010establishing Standpoint Invariance.\n\n6.3  Feminist and Standpoint Epistemologies  \nCritics note that the social position of inquirers can materially affect findings (e.g., androcentric biases in clinical medicine).  On the present account, objectivity does not require erasing social standpoints but ensuring that rotating through them does not make a consequential epistemic difference.  Inclusion of marginalized perspectives thus functions as a risk-balancing device.\n\n7. Objections and Replies  \n\nObjection 1:  \u201cBut every mitigation strategy itself relies on trust (e.g., trust that colleagues follow the protocol).  So trust is still foundational.\u201d  \n\nReply:  True, some baseline testimonial trust is indispensable, but that is a generic precondition of any social practice, not what differentiates objective from non-objective science.  The question is: which practices minimize the amount of brute trust an outsider must extend?  The invariance framework answers precisely that.\n\nObjection 2:  \u201cWhat about value-laden judgments (Douglas\u2019s \u2018inductive risk\u2019) where no amount of elimination can neutralize subjectivity?\u201d  \n\nReply:  Where stakes are high, \u03b5 shrinks and full invariance may be unattainable.  In such cases, objectivity demands explicit articulation of value assumptions followed by pluralistic deliberation\u2014again a form of exposure and balancing.  The function remains constant even if perfect attainment is unrealistic.\n\nObjection 3:  \u201cIsn\u2019t invariance too formalistic?  Science progresses by exploiting idiosyncratic hunches.\u201d  \n\nReply:  Objectivity is not the enemy of creativity.  It governs the public\u2010facing validation phase, not the context of discovery.  Standpoint\u2010sensitive hunches are welcome so long as their deliverances survive the invariance test when subjected to communal scrutiny.\n\n8. Illustrative Cases  \n\nCase 1:  Temperature Measurement in Global Climate Studies  \nHundreds of weather stations vary in equipment, maintenance, and local environments.  Procedural objectivity enters with standardized thermometers and satellite proxies; convergent objectivity with cross-validation between land, ocean, and satellite series; interactive objectivity via open datasets that permit independent re\u2010analysis.  The aggregate trend (\u2248 0.2 \u00b0C / decade) remains stable under these substitutions, hence earns the label \u201cobjective.\u201d  That makes public policy trust rational, not blind.\n\nCase 2:  The Double-Blind Clinical Trial  \nHere elimination is central.  Randomization removes clinician discretion; placebo controls neutralize patient expectations; blinding removes observer bias.  Each element targets a distinct standpoint risk.  When outcome differences survive all substitutions, we call the result objective and license trust in the drug\u2019s efficacy.\n\nCase 3:  Gravitational Wave Detection (LIGO)  \nLIGO operates twin detectors thousands of miles apart.  A candidate signal must appear in both within milliseconds.  Here convergence (independent detectors) and procedural standardization (identical interferometers) jointly secure standpoint invariance.  The black hole merger signal of 2015 passed that test; hence widely trusted.\n\n9. Comparative Advantages over the \u201cTrust First\u201d View  \n\nA. Diagnostic Power:  Identifies where to intervene when trust erodes (e.g., replication crisis).  \nB. Normative Clarity:  Explains why transparency and plurality matter (they serve invariance).  \nC. Theoretical Fruitfulness:  Unifies sociology of science insights (risk distribution) with formal conceptions (symmetry, invariance).\n\n10. Conclusion  \n\nObjectivity in science is not a free-floating aura of trustworthiness.  It is a suite of engineered practices whose shared functional core is the neutralization of standpoint-specific epistemic risk.  When those practices succeed, the invariance of results under perspective-shifts rationalizes the trust we place in them.  Different senses of objectivity\u2014procedural, convergent, interactive\u2014are thus species of a single genus.  Trust is the flower; risk-mitigating invariance is the root.", "output_tokens": 2779, "reasoning_tokens": 448}

Introduction: the puzzle and the promise\n\nPhilosophers of science increasingly treat \u201cobjectivity\u201d not as a single monolith but as a cluster-concept with several recognizable species: procedural, detached, interactive, convergent, and so on. Arthur Fine once suggested that what makes them all counts as \u201cobjectivity\u201d is a common \u201cattitude of trust.\u201d Heather Douglas similarly writes that when scientists or laypersons praise a result as objective, they are implicitly saying: \u201cyou can trust it.\u201d This thought captures something right\u2014after all, objectivity is invoked primarily to reassure us\u2014but it is also too indeterminate to guide either philosophical analysis or policy. We need to know: trust whom, about what, and on what grounds?\n\nMy thesis is twofold.\n\n(1) The relation between objectivity and trust is asymmetrical: objectivity is not trust itself, nor is it simply trust-worthiness; rather, it is a cluster of epistemic practices that rationally warrant a certain form of second-order reliance. Call this relation warranted reliance. Trust is the cognitive and affective state we adopt toward a claim when we take warranted reliance to be in place.\n\n(2) What unifies the diverse senses of objectivity is precisely that each supplies a distinct mechanism for generating warranted reliance. More formally:\n\nAn epistemic output O is (scientifically) objective to the extent that the process P that produced O incorporates at least one mechanism M that systematically neutralizes idiosyncratic error sources E, and the neutralization is publicly recognizable in a way that licenses reliance by any suitably situated epistemic agent S.\n\nDifferent senses of objectivity isolate different families of mechanisms M, but the overarching property\u2014publicly recognizable neutralization of idiosyncratic error\u2014does the unifying work.\n\nThe remainder of the essay defends this thesis in five steps: (i) clarifying the varieties of trust; (ii) demonstrating how each species of objectivity fits the \u201cpublic neutralization\u201d model; (iii) rebutting the view that trust is conceptually prior to objectivity; (iv) drawing sharper distinctions between objectivity, trust, and mere reliability; and (v) illustrating the account with two detailed cases.\n\n2. Varieties of trust and their epistemic payoffs\n\nAnglophone philosophy typically uses \u201ctrust\u201d as a placeholder for a rich family of attitudes. We must parse at least four members of that family before we can connect the term to objectivity:\n\n2.1 Personal trust: an attitude A bears toward B grounded in interpersonal bonds, affective commitments, or shared histories. Examples include trusting one\u2019s physician or a co-author.\n\n2.2 Institutional trust: the confidence citizens place in agencies such as the FDA or IPCC. This is mediated by presumptions about procedural safeguards rather than by direct acquaintance.\n\n2.3 Reliance: a non-normative, purely instrumental expectation that some system will behave predictably (e.g., relying on a calculator). One can rely without trusting in any robust sense.\n\n2.4 Warranted reliance: here a subject\u2019s reliance is grounded in cognizance of mechanisms that make the instrument or institution stably reliable. One might rely on an uncalibrated bathroom scale, but one warrants that reliance only when one knows it has been periodically checked against standards.\n\nScientific objectivity aims to secure the fourth, not the first three, attitudes. By building mechanisms that neutralize idiosyncratic error, science as an institution makes it rational\u2014though not infallible\u2014for strangers to rely on its outputs. Put differently, objectivity is the set of design features that upgrade mere reliance to warranted reliance.\n\n3. How each species of objectivity instantiates the \u201cpublic neutralization\u201d model\n\n3.1 Procedural objectivity (Mill, Daston & Galison): Standardized protocols (double-blind trials, calibration charts) constrain individual judgment, thereby canceling personal eccentricities. The mechanism M is the algorithmic removal of private discretion. Because the procedures are codified and publicly inspectable, outsiders can recognize the neutralization, fulfilling the publicity condition.\n\n3.2 Convergent or concordant objectivity (Karl Pearson, William Whewell): Independent investigative pathways all point to the same quantitative value (e.g., Avogadro\u2019s number). The mechanism is robustness through multiple-method triangulation. Idiosyncratic errors specific to any single instrument are washed out when independent lines yield the same estimate. Publication norms that record methods transparently render this mechanism visible to the wider community.\n\n3.3 Interactive objectivity (Helen Longino): Uptake of criticism within an open community screens off parochial background assumptions. The mechanism here is regulated critical dialogue. Longino\u2019s four norms\u2014public venues, uptake of criticism, public standards, tempered power relations\u2014together ensure that local biases are exposed to systematic scrutiny and thus neutralized.\n\n3.4 Model-based or structural objectivity (Nancy Cartwright, Alex Reutlinger): Idealized models that track formal features while bracketing causal noise allow us to isolate structure from accidental circumstance. The mechanism is abstraction plus mathematical deduction, which neutralizes context-specific contingencies.\n\nEach version of objectivity, then, can be redescribed as deploying a mechanism that (i) targets some plausible error source, (ii) mitigates or cancels it, and (iii) does so via means publicly legible to other investigators. The unification lies in that shared three-part schema.\n\n4. Why objectivity is not (mere) trust: against Fine and Douglas\n\nFine\u2019s locution \u201can attitude of trust\u201d invites two readings.\n\nReading 1: Conceptual priority\u2014objectivity just is trust. That equates the property of an epistemic product (its objectivity) with a psychological attitude of potential consumers (their trust). But concept-identity fails, because one can rationally trust a claim that later turns out non-objective (e.g., early claims about dietary cholesterol) and one can distrust claims that are in fact highly objective (e.g., vaccine safety among sceptics). Objectivity and trust thus have different success conditions and can come apart.\n\nReading 2: Constitutive relation\u2014a claim is objective if and only if it is rightly the object of trust. This fares better, yet still it makes objectivity hostage to prevailing rational norms. Imagine a historical community that has not yet invented double-blind trials. Its standards for \u201crightly trusting\u201d clinical claims differ materially from ours. But objectivity should not fluctuate merely because communal epistemic norms shift; otherwise Newton\u2019s claims would have become less objective post-Einstein. Hence \u201crightful trust\u201d is insufficiently stable to ground objectivity.\n\nDouglas\u2019s upgraded suggestion that objectivity equals \u201ctrustworthiness\u201d improves matters but still blurs lines. Trust-worthiness pertains to the agent (or process) rather than the product. A trustworthy thermometer can yield a single unobjective reading after sudden miscalibration. Objectivity is a property of outputs considered in context; trustworthiness is a dispositional property of instruments or agents. Collapsing the two conflates act- and agent-evaluation.\n\nOur \u201cpublic neutralization\u201d model preserves the intuitive link Fine and Douglas were tracking\u2014objective outputs occasion rational trust\u2014while retaining conceptual independence: objectivity is the property that systematically warrants reliance; trust is the added attitude we are justified in adopting once we recognize that warrant.\n\n5. Objectivity, trust, and reliability: sharpening the distinctions\n\nThe slogan \u201cobjectivity means reliable knowledge\u201d is too thin. A broken clock is reliable twice a day but not objective. What is missing are:\n\n(i) Systematicity: objectivity aims at stable reliability across contexts, not sporadic coincidence.\n\n(ii) Error-neutralizing intention: objectivity involves deliberate design features to offset recognized weaknesses.\n\n(iii) Public articulability: the mechanisms of neutralization must be open to inspection; black-box miracles don\u2019t count as objectivity even if de facto reliable.\n\nWarranted reliance tracks all three properties; plain reliability does not. Trust can be accorded absent them; objectivity cannot.\n\n6. Case studies\n\n6.1 Randomized controlled trials and surrogate endpoints\n\nConsider pharmaceutical trials that rely on \u201csurrogate endpoints\u201d (e.g., lowering LDL cholesterol) instead of hard outcomes (e.g., reduced myocardial infarction). Critics worry that drug companies choose endpoints that overstate clinical benefit. How does objectivity analysis proceed?\n\nProcedural objectivity: randomization, blinding, and pre-registration neutralize conscious and unconscious biases.\n\nConvergent objectivity: meta-analyses bring together multiple trials, checking whether heterogeneous designs converge on the same effect size.\n\nInteractive objectivity: post-marketing surveillance and open data allow external epidemiologists to critique methodologies, forcing reassessment of endpoints if they fail to correlate with patient-centered outcomes.\n\nOnce these mechanisms are publicly documented\u2014trial protocols, statistical code, adverse-event reports\u2014clinicians and regulators acquire warranted reliance on the claim that Drug X lowers cardiac risk. Whether they in fact feel trust depends on other factors (e.g., past scandals), but the epistemic warrant is secured by the objectivity mechanisms, not by psychological sentiment.\n\n6.2 Climate modeling and the IPCC\n\nSkeptics allege that climate projections merely reflect modelers\u2019 priors. The IPCC\u2019s procedures are, however, engineered to neutralize precisely such idiosyncrasy.\n\nProcedural objectivity: standardized emission scenarios (SSPs) and agreed-upon evaluation metrics ensure comparability.\n\nConvergent objectivity: multi-model ensembles from independent research centers must converge within statistically assessable bounds before counts toward consensus.\n\nInteractive objectivity: the review process involves hundreds of scientists across divergent disciplines and political geographies, fostering vigorous critique.\n\nStructural objectivity: the core equations track physical conservation laws, abstracting away from local measurement noise.\n\nLaid out in public assessment reports, these mechanisms become legible even to non-experts willing to examine methodological appendices. The rational stance is warranted reliance. Whether skeptical citizens actually trust IPCC results is a sociological question; the normative question of objectivity is answered by the presence of publicly verifiable neutralization measures.\n\n7. Dialectical challenges and replies\n\nObjection 1: Some error sources cannot be foreseen; therefore no neutralization mechanism can target them, yet we still call the science objective.\n\nReply: Objectivity comes in degrees. The model requires only that for salient, foreseeable error sources, neutralization mechanisms exist. Unforeseeable errors will be caught later via further mechanisms (replication, anomaly detection). The model thus incorporates fallibilism without sacrificing normativity.\n\nObjection 2: Public recognizability privileges well-educated elites; lay publics cannot evaluate mechanisms and thus must revert to brute trust.\n\nReply: Recognizability is indexed to the broad scientific community, not necessarily to every citizen. But laypersons can exploit epistemic proxies\u2014journalistic intermediaries, consensus statements\u2014whose credibility depends on the same transparency. A mechanism\u2019s being in principle inspectable by experts suffices to generate downstream chains of warranted reliance.\n\nObjection 3: Some domains (e.g., ethnography) rely on thick description and researcher immersion, defying procedural standardization. Are they forever condemned to subjectivity?\n\nReply: The model is pluralistic about mechanisms. In ethnography, peer debriefing, reflexive journals, and triangulation with participant checks serve the neutralization role. Objectivity does not mandate quantitative methods; it mandates publicly recognizable strategies for controlling idiosyncratic error, whatever form they take.\n\n8. Advantages over competing accounts\n\n1. Conceptual clarity: separates product-level objectivity from agent-level trustworthiness and state-level trust.\n\n2. Unification without reification: explains why different senses of objectivity legitimately fall under one heading without reducing them to a lowest common denominator like \u201ctruth.\u201d\n\n3. Normative guidance: tells practitioners what to do\u2014identify salient error sources, institute neutralization mechanisms, document them publicly.\n\n4. Compatibility with social epistemology: incorporates Longino\u2019s and Douglas\u2019s insights about the indispensability of collective critique while preserving a role for procedural checks.\n\n5. Scalability: applies from individual instruments (thermometers) up to global research enterprises (the LHC).\n\n9. Prospects for extension\n\nThe \u201cpublic neutralization\u201d account suggests a research program. One might catalogue typical error families (measurement drift, selection bias, model misspecification, socio-political value intrusion) and map corresponding neutralization strategies. Comparative studies could then ask which combinations maximize warranted reliance relative to resource constraints\u2014a question of design ethics as much as epistemology.\n\n10. Conclusion: objectivity as the architecture of warranted reliance\n\nCalling a scientific claim \u201cobjective\u201d is not to confer a metaphysical aura of view-from-nowhere impartiality, nor merely to declare our personal faith in the scientists involved. It is to signal that the claim issued from a process equipped with publicly inspectable safeguards that systematically neutralize idiosyncratic error, thereby licensing any suitably informed agent to rely on it. That license, once appreciated, naturally gives rise to psychological trust, but the trust is the consequence, not the essence, of objectivity. By locating the unity of objectivity in the publicly recognizable architecture of warranted reliance, we clarify both how the diverse senses of objectivity hang together and why appeals to \u201ctrust\u201d are apt yet insufficiently precise.", "output_tokens": 3216, "reasoning_tokens": 448}

Framing the Puzzle  \n\nWhen scientists, journalists, or policy\u2010makers call a measurement \u201cobjective,\u201d they are usually recommending that others rely on it. Trust, therefore, is undeniably in the neighborhood. Yet the leap from \u201cobjective\u201d to \u201ctrusted\u201d is too quick. We trust spouses, babysitters, bank employees, or computers, but we do not call them objective. Conversely, a blood\u2010test protocol can be highly objective even when nobody (yet) trusts the laboratory that runs it. So objectivity and trust are neither identical nor interchangeable. The present essay argues for a more precise relationship:  \n\nThesis: Scientific objectivity is a property of methods, results, or deliberative practices that makes them stably warrant\u2010responsive across relevant perspectives; when that property is publicly visible, it grounds\u2014but does not constitute\u2014rational trust. The several \u201csenses\u201d of objectivity (procedural, convergent, interactive, etc.) can be unified by viewing them as strategies for achieving perspective\u2010invariant warrant. Put schematically,\n\nObjectivity = Robust invariance under perspective transformations \u2192 warrants  \nTrust = The downstream attitude of relying on deliverances so certified.\n\nI first clarify the concepts of trust and objectivity, diagnose why they can be confused, and then develop the invariance account. I show how the three standard senses of objectivity implement the same invariance\u2010securing strategy, and end by addressing objections and illustrating the view with two cases from contemporary science.\n\n2. Two Concepts: Trust and Objectivity\n\n2.1 What is Trust?  \nPhilosophical analyses of trust converge on three elements:  \n\na. Epistemic dependence: I hand over some epistemic or practical matter to A rather than performing it myself.  \nb. Competence expectation: I expect A to be able to deliver.  \nc. Commitment expectation: I expect A to be disposed to deliver in a way that favors my interest or a shared goal, not merely her own.  \n\nTrust, then, is primarily an attitude held by person S toward agent A or artifact X. It is relational and normative: I can mistakenly trust what is not trustworthy.\n\n2.2 What is Scientific Objectivity?  \nObjectivity, by contrast, is usually ascribed to products (measurements, data sets, theories) or to procedures and institutions (blind peer review, randomized clinical trials, double\u2010blind protocols). It is not an attitude but a property: roughly, the property of being insulated from idiosyncratic, perspective\u2010bound distortions. Thus objectivity concerns the internal structure of knowhow or deliverances; trust concerns the external stance of users toward them.\n\n2.3 Why the Confusion?  \nThe conflation arises because objectivity is the main ground we cite when we ask why a stranger should rationally trust an unfamiliar result. \u201cObjective\u201d functions rhetorically as a compressed, if often vague, testimonial: \u201cThis result is the kind you can trust.\u201d But the pointer to trust is pragmatic, not constitutive.\n\n3. From Rugged Individualism to Social Epistemology  \n\nFine and Douglas are correct that the function of objectivity in modern science is to make results fit for uptake by an epistemic community characterized by radical division of labor. No individual can replicate all measurements; at some point we all rely on what Bruno Latour calls \u201cblack boxes.\u201d The epistemic problem is therefore: How can consumers rationally rely on outputs they did not produce or fully scrutinize? One answer is to maintain elaborate face\u2010to\u2010face trust networks. The modern scientific answer, however, is different: we design procedures that remove the need for personal trust wherever feasible\u2014\u201cmechanical objectivity,\u201d in Daston and Galison\u2019s famous phrase. Yet that very design then becomes a public reason for trust. In short,\n\nObjectivity secures impersonal trust: a willingness to rely on results produced by unknown others because they emerge from perspective\u2010neutral procedures.\n\n4. The Invariance Account  \n\n4.1 Robustness Under Perspective Transformations  \nLet us sharpen this. Call a perspective any factor tied to a particular agent or set of circumstances: sensory apparatus, local background theory, social interests, methodological choices. An epistemic product P is objective to the degree that it remains warranted under transformations T that map one legitimate perspective to another, i.e.,\n\nFor all relevant T, Warrant(P | perspective p) = Warrant(P | T(p)).\n\nThis is an invariance condition. It does not require sameness of numerical outcome\u2014different instruments may yield different absolute readings\u2014but it requires systematic, explainable covariance such that the warrant of P is not hostage to any one idiosyncratic vantage point.\n\n4.2 How Invariance Grounds Rational Trust  \nIf consumers know (or have good evidence) that a result satisfies this invariance, they have a public, person\u2010independent reason to rely on it. This move from property to attitude is mediated by norms of rational reliance: one ought to trust what is reliably invariant across perspectives relevant to one\u2019s interests.\n\n5. Unifying the Senses of Objectivity  \n\nLet us examine the three types most cited by Fine, Douglas, and others.\n\n5.1 Procedural Objectivity  \nThis refers to mechanical, rule\u2010following methodologies that suppress individual judgment: standardized questionnaires, algorithmic data processing, or double\u2010blind drug trials. The relevant perspective transformation here is substitution of one competent operator for another. Method M is procedurally objective when P would emerge with equal warrant regardless of which qualified person implements M. Procedural rules thus enforce person\u2010invariance.\n\n5.2 Convergent (or Ontic) Objectivity  \nConvergent objectivity is achieved when independent lines of empirical evidence arrive at the same theoretical claim or numerical parameter\u2014e.g., Avogadro\u2019s number estimated by electrical, vapor\u2010density, and Brownian\u2010motion methods. Here the perspective transformations involve changes in instrumentation, auxiliary theory, and measurement environment. Robust convergence across those transformations secures invariance, hence objectivity.\n\n5.3 Interactive (or Social) Objectivity  \nInteractive objectivity is the product of critical discussion, replication attempts, and peer review. The transformation is from one social\u2010cognitive standpoint to another: skeptics, rivals, interdisciplinary peers. Surviving these tests shows that the warrant of P is invariant under an exchange of evaluative perspectives.\n\nThus all three senses instantiate the same functional core: establishing invariance by neutralizing a different class of perspective\u2010bound disturbances.\n\n6. Precision, Nuance, and Objections  \n\n6.1 Is Invariance Too Strong?  \nSome might argue that no claim is strictly invariant\u2014every measurement depends on convention\u2010laden units, background theory, even socio\u2010political values. The invariance account handles this by relativizing to \u201crelevant perspectives,\u201d where relevance is fixed pragmatically by the aims of inquiry. For archeologists, dating uncertainty of \u00b150 years may be invariant enough; for particle physicists, \u00b110 picoseconds is not. Objectivity is thus not absolute but interest\u2010relative, while still supplying more than sheer social endorsement.\n\n6.2 Does the Account Collapse into Consensus?  \nInteractive objectivity might look like simple majority rule. But critical interaction aims at convergence through argument and evidence, not mere polling. A proposition can be socially accepted without being interactively objective if the dissenting perspectives were never adequately represented. Hence the invariance requirement imposes a constraint stronger than consensus: dissent must be addressable in principle.\n\n6.3 Value\u2010Laden Science  \nDouglas herself emphasizes \u201cinductive risk\u201d: the unavoidable role of non\u2010epistemic values in deciding evidential thresholds. Does that refute the invariance model? Not if values are treated as part of perspectives. A climate sensitivity estimate might be labeled objective when it remains warranted across the range of reasonable policy weights assigned to false positives and false negatives. The account accommodates value\u2010ladenness by adding a dimension of variation rather than by pretending values can be scrubbed away.\n\n6.4 Replication Crisis  \nThe recent failure to replicate many psychological findings has been interpreted as a blow to objectivity. On the invariance view, the crisis is evidence that previously accepted results were never objective to begin with\u2014they lacked perspective invariance across laboratories, statistical analysts, and participant pools. Far from undermining the account, the crisis illustrates its diagnostic power.\n\n7. Examples Doing Real Work  \n\n7.1 Doping Control in Olympic Sports  \nConsider the World Anti\u2010Doping Agency\u2019s two\u2010tier testing protocol: first, a standardized procedure detects a prohibited substance; second, an independent lab repeats the measurement blind to the first outcome. Procedural objectivity neutralizes operator bias; convergent objectivity is sought by using both mass spectrometry and immunoassay; interactive objectivity appears when the athlete\u2019s representatives can challenge the finding before the Court of Arbitration for Sport. The combination yields a result that remains warranted whether we transform the perspective from lab A to lab B, from instrument 1 to instrument 2, or from prosecuting authority to defense counsel. Rational trust by athletes and spectators is thereby underwritten\u2014though, importantly, not guaranteed, since undetected lab corruption would break the invariance.\n\n7.2 Climate Model Ensemble Projections  \nGeneral circulation models (GCMs) differ in grid resolution, parameterization schemes, and numerical solvers. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports rely heavily on multimodel ensembles that compute a probability distribution over future temperatures. Convergent objectivity is pursued via robustness across models; interactive objectivity via public code release and \u201cModel Intercomparison Projects\u201d; procedural objectivity via shared input data sets and standardized evaluation metrics. The invariance across these model\u2010space transformations grounds trust by policymakers who cannot evaluate each model individually.\n\n8. Comparative Advantages Over the Trust\u2010Identity Thesis  \n\nThe invariance model avoids several pitfalls:\n\na. Non\u2010Circulatory: Saying \u201cobjective because trustworthy\u201d presupposes the trust it is meant to secure. Invariance grounds trust rather than presupposing it.  \nb. Granularity: It explains why some steps in a research chain are more objective (and therefore more trust\u2010worthy) than others, letting us allocate scrutiny efficiently.  \nc. Diagnostic Use: It provides a principled way to flag weak links by asking under which transformations warrant may fail.\n\n9. Remaining Issues and Research Directions  \n\nThe invariance account suggests new metrics: one might quantify objectivity by sensitivity analysis\u2014how fast does warrant degrade as we move through perspective space? Unifying the senses of objectivity therefore points toward a program of \u201cobjectivity engineering,\u201d designing research pipelines so that warrant is maximally insensitive to foreseeable perturbations. Questions for future work include:  \n\u2022 How to balance cost against degrees of invariance?  \n\u2022 Can machine learning systems be tuned for algorithmic invariance to training sets, thereby earning objectivity?  \n\u2022 Do social media platforms need an analogue of interactive objectivity to counteract echo chambers?  \n\nSuch questions show that the account is generative, not merely classificatory.\n\n10. Conclusion  \n\nObjectivity and trust are intimately related but distinct. Objectivity is an invariance property of epistemic products and practices; trust is the warranted attitude of reliance those products deserve once their invariance is publicly visible. The classic senses of objectivity\u2014procedural, convergent, interactive\u2014are best seen as three families of invariance\u2010securing strategies, each neutralizing a different class of perspective\u2010dependence. Recognizing this unifying function explains both the rhetorical link to trust and the conceptual difference. Moreover, it equips us with a framework to diagnose failures (replication crises), defend the value\u2010laden yet objective character of policy\u2010relevant science, and guide the design of new epistemic institutions. In short, we can trust science where, and only where, its warrants survive the storm of perspectives.", "output_tokens": 2995, "reasoning_tokens": 512}

Introduction and Thesis  \n\nWhen journalists describe a result as \u201cobjective,\u201d they mean, in the vernacular, that readers can trust it.  Arthur Fine and Heather Douglas, among others, have urged philosophers of science to take that ordinary thought seriously.  But the claim that objectivity just is trust\u2014or that the various senses of objectivity are united because they all \u201csignal trustworthiness\u201d\u2014is unsatisfyingly loose.  Trust is a distinctive interpersonal attitude involving expectations about another\u2019s competence and goodwill; objectivity, by contrast, is a property of investigative procedures, bodies of evidence, or epistemic products.  Their relationship is closer to that between a legal warrant and the confidence it licenses: objectivity affords, justifies, and regulates trust, but it is not identical with it.\n\nMy thesis is therefore two-fold:\n\nA. Objectivity is best understood as a *system of publicly accessible safeguards*\u2014procedural, evidential, and social\u2014that make it reasonable for diverse audiences to rely on scientific claims *even in the face of potential bias or conflict of interest*.  These safeguards work by constraining how claims are produced and by rendering the provenance of those claims transparent.  \n\nB. Trust enters the picture as a downstream, second-personal attitude that is *warranted* precisely when the relevant safeguards are in place and functioning.  What unifies the disparate senses of \u201cobjectivity\u201d (procedural, convergent, interactive, measurement-standard, etc.) is that *each identifies a distinct family of safeguards aimed at blocking a specific failure mode of inquiry*.  Together they constitute a layered architecture whose collective output is reliability that can legitimately be taken on trust.\n\nThe resulting picture preserves Fine\u2019s and Douglas\u2019s insight\u2014that objectivity earns trust\u2014while supplying the needed precision: objectivity is the *norm-governed enabling condition* of warranted trust, not a mere synonym for it.\n\n2. Three Preliminary Distinctions\n\nBefore developing the view, we must disentangle three commonly conflated notions.\n\n2.1 Trust vs. Mere Reliance  \nI rely on my alarm clock but do not *trust* it in the sense in which I trust a colleague.  Trust, paradigmatically, involves the expectation that another agent *will not betray* my interests.  The ethical dimension\u2014goodwill, responsiveness, or accountability\u2014is conceptually built in.  When I \u201ctrust\u201d climate scientists, I expect a cocktail of competence, honesty, and responsiveness to criticism.  My reliance is therefore second-personal and normative, not merely predictive.\n\n2.2 Individual vs. Systemic Objectivity  \nA result may be objective because it stems from an instrument that systematically cancels out noise (e.g., radio-astronomy interferometry), or because a community has arranged its division of cognitive labor so that idiosyncratic biases are filtered out (Longino\u2019s \u201ctransformative criticism\u201d).  Philosophers must resist collapsing these layers.  The safeguards that matter for licensing trust often lie at the *systems* level.\n\n2.3 Epistemic vs. Moral Trustworthiness  \nHeather Douglas emphasizes that inductive-risk decisions\u2014how to trade false positives and negatives\u2014are ethically loaded, so the public must trust scientists\u2019 values as well as their methods.  That is right, but we should not conflate the moral angle with the epistemic one.  The architecture of objectivity I develop below explains how methodological and institutional safeguards can justify epistemic trust even if we remain morally agnostic about individual actors.\n\n3. Mapping Scientific Failure Modes to Forms of Objectivity\n\nInstead of asking \u201cWhat do all senses of objectivity have in common?\u201d in the abstract, let us proceed diagnostically.  Each canonical sense of objectivity arose historically as a remedy to a *distinct vulnerability* in scientific practice.\n\n3.1 Measurement Error \u2192 \u201cMechanical Objectivity\u201d  \nMid-19th-century astronomers worried that human judgment intruded when, say, drawing nebulae.  The safeguard: photographic plates and, later, automatic recorders that left \u201cnature to speak for itself.\u201d  Mechanical objectivity mitigates *perception-based distortions* by outsourcing to stable instruments.\n\n3.2 Experimenter Bias \u2192 \u201cProcedural Objectivity\u201d  \nPsychologists learned that researchers can (inadvertently) nudge subjects.  Double-blind protocols, pre-registration, and randomization are safeguards that disallow selective handling of evidence.  This form shields against *motivational and expectation bias*.\n\n3.3 Context-Dependent Interpretation \u2192 \u201cInteractive Objectivity\u201d (Douglas)  \nThe worry: theory-ladenness and value-laden inductive-risk choices can skew conclusions.  Interactive objectivity demands *discursive openness*: exposure to critical dialogue, disclosure of inductive-risk value judgments, and responsive revision.  The safeguard here is *public accountability through criticism*.\n\n3.4 Under-determination \u2192 \u201cConvergent Objectivity\u201d  \nMultiple independent lines of evidence converging on the same parameter (e.g., Avogadro\u2019s number) serve as a cross-check.  Convergent objectivity guards against *model-dependent vulnerabilities* by ensuring that errors or biases in any single approach are unlikely to align fortuitously.\n\n3.5 Social Biases \u2192 \u201cCollective Objectivity\u201d  \nFeminist epistemologists note that gendered assumptions shaped primatology\u2019s early \u201caggression-dominance\u201d narratives.  Diversifying research communities functions as a safeguard against *background ideology bias*.  The resulting objectivity emerges from the social structure of the epistemic collective.\n\nThe key unifying feature is obvious once we view the landscape through a risk-management lens: *Each sense of objectivity is the name for a family of design features whose task is to make the truth-value of claims insensitive to a targeted class of perturbations.*  That is the function that earns our trust.\n\n4. From Safeguards to Warranted Trust\n\nHow exactly does the presence of safeguards justify trust?  Here a useful analogy is cybersecurity.  A cryptographic protocol is *secure* if, were an adversary to tamper, the protocol would detect or thwart the interference with high probability.  Likewise:\n\nObjectivity Condition (OC):  \nA set of investigative practices S confers objectivity on claim p for audience A iff, *were p false*, S would, with high probability relative to A\u2019s epistemic position, either prevent the acceptance of p or eventually lead to its rejection.\n\nOC is a modal or counterfactual reliability condition akin to epistemic \u201csafety\u201d (Williamson).  Trust becomes rational when the audience has public evidence that OC is satisfied.  The emphasis on *public evidence* is crucial: objectivity is not merely a de facto correlation with truth; it is the *replicable, inspectable, accountability-generating* character of that correlation that licenses inter-subjective reliance.\n\n5. Fine\u2019s NOA and Douglas\u2019s Inductive-Risk Account Revisited\n\nFine\u2019s Natural Ontological Attitude (NOA) cautioned against erecting metaphysical edifices on top of scientific realism; what deserves philosophical respect, he claimed, is the ordinary commitment scientists exhibit toward well-tested results\u2014a matter of *trust*.  My proposal clarifies the mechanism: that commitment is rational because scientists inhabit and police a network of safeguards.  Fine was right that we should not ask for metaphysical guarantees stronger than the practices can supply, but we can be far more explicit about why those practices are enough.\n\nDouglas, for her part, emphasizes that citizens must trust that scientists have settled inductive-risk questions in a manner aligned with democratic values.  On my account, that trust is warranted *to the extent* that interactive-objectivity safeguards\u2014pluralistic deliberation, transparent reporting, and institutional checks\u2014ensure those value decisions are publicly contestable.  The approach honors her ethical insight while distinguishing clearly between value-laden *decisions* and the *epistemic licenses* those decisions generate.\n\n6. Objections and Replies\n\nObjection 1: \u201cSafeguards might fail silently; hence trust remains psychologically inevitable but epistemically unjustified.\u201d  \nReply: No architecture guarantees infallibility.  The right standard is *comparative robustness*: is it more reliable than realistically available alternatives?  Moreover, the safeguard framework embeds *self-corrective* norms: replication, open data, and error-reporting channels function as after-the-fact detectors.  The architecture is designed not for perfection but for *error discoverability*.  When silent failures accumulate (e.g., the replication crisis), the discovery triggers reform\u2014pre-registration, larger sample sizes\u2014closing the gap.\n\nObjection 2: \u201cYour account is elitist; it risks marginalizing laypersons who cannot independently audit safeguards.\u201d  \nReply: All trust relationships incur asymmetries of expertise.  The safeguard model mitigates, not exacerbates, this asymmetry by insisting on public visibility where possible: conflict-of-interest disclosures, data repositories, documented protocols.  Journalistic intermediaries and watchdog NGOs function as epistemic brokers translating technical provenance information into accessible verdicts, thereby democratizing the grounds of trust.\n\nObjection 3: \u201cSome sciences (e.g., paleontology) cannot replicate experiments; does your view render them non-objective?\u201d  \nReply: The notion of a \u201csafeguard\u201d is deliberately pluralistic.  In historical sciences, convergent evidence from independent dating methods, stratigraphic correlation, and functional morphology play the role that replication plays in lab settings.  What matters is not literal repeatability but *counter-checkability*, tailored to the domain\u2019s constraints.\n\n7. Examples in Action\n\n7.1 The COVID-19 Vaccine Trials  \nRandomization, double-blinding, predefined endpoints, and independent data monitoring committees exemplify procedural objectivity.  Moreover, the release of trial protocols and datasets allowed third-party statisticians to critique subgroup analyses\u2014an instantiation of interactive objectivity.  Because these safeguards are public and audit-friendly, health agencies and citizens can rationally trust the efficacy estimates despite pharmaceutical companies\u2019 vested interests.\n\n7.2 Forensic Bite-Mark Analysis (a Counter-Example)  \nContrast this with forensic odontology, where subjective eyeballing of bite-mark patterns led to wrongful convictions.  No standardized protocols, low inter-examiner reliability, and absence of error-rate studies meant safeguards were missing.  Judges and juries *did* trust the testimony, but that trust was unwarranted because OC failed: had the identifications been false (as they sometimes were), the procedures offered no systematic mechanism for error detection.  The safeguard framework neatly diagnoses the epistemic pathology.\n\n8. Relation to Existing Accounts\n\n8.1 Reliability Theories of Knowledge  \nMy proposal mirrors process-reliabilism but injects a social-epistemic twist: the reliability must be *publicly attestable* to license interpersonal trust.  Hence it sits between individualistic reliabilism and Longinoan social epistemology.\n\n8.2 Standpoint Epistemology  \nFeminist theorists argue that marginalized standpoints expose unnoticed assumptions.  From the safeguard perspective, standpoint diversity serves as a *bias countermeasure*, a component of collective objectivity.  The framework thus vindicates the epistemic rationale of standpoint theory without committing to a relativist ontology of truth.\n\n9. Why Trust Is Not the Unifier\n\nWe can now state precisely why \u201cobjectivity = trust\u201d is a category mistake.\n\na. Direction of Explanation: Trust is the *attitude licited* by evidence of safeguards, not the constitutive substrate of those safeguards.  \n\nb. Normativity: Objectivity conditions are *publicly normative*\u2014violations can be faulted\u2014while trust is a subjective stance that can be misguided or withheld unreasonably.  \n\nc. Granularity: By itemizing specific safeguard families, we explain variation in trustworthiness across contexts; a monolithic appeal to trust blurs these crucial gradations.\n\n10. Toward a Research Program\n\nIf this analysis is correct, philosophers and sociologists of science should redirect inquiry from debates over realism versus antirealism toward empirical questions:\n\n\u2022 Which safeguard configurations optimize counter-checkability in big-data fields where replication is infeasible?\n\u2022 How do funding structures perturb safeguard efficacy (e.g., reproducibility under commercial secrecy)?\n\u2022 Can we quantify \u201csafeguard density\u201d as a predictor of field-wide reliability?\n\nAnswering such questions would help institutions allocate oversight resources where epistemic vulnerability is highest, aligning with Douglas\u2019s call for socially responsible science.\n\n11. Conclusion\n\nScientific objectivity is the engineered *architecture of error-mitigation* that makes our epistemic environment trustworthy.  Trust, though essential for the uptake of scientific results, is not itself the foundation but the rational *response* to that architecture.  Procedural, convergent, and interactive objectivity each designate a suite of safeguards tailored to a characteristic failure mode\u2014perceptual bias, under-determination, or social/ethical distortion.  What ultimately unifies these senses is their shared counterfactual role: *had the claim been false, the safeguards would likely have exposed the falsity*.  By making reliability *inspectable*, they transform mere reliance into warranted trust.  That, and not trust per se, is the common basis we have been seeking.", "output_tokens": 3177, "reasoning_tokens": 384}

Orienting the Problem  \n\nPhilosophers of science routinely distinguish a family of notions that fly under the banner \u2018objectivity\u2019: procedural objectivity (results produced by standardized methods indifferent to who uses them), convergent or inter\u2010subjective objectivity (robust agreement among investigators), and interactive objectivity (results that have survived organised critical scrutiny).  Arthur Fine, Heather Douglas and others have suggested that what unites these notions is trustworthiness: to call something \u2018objective\u2019 is, in effect, to certify it as a fitting object of trust.  Yet \u201ctrust\u201d can mean anything from mere predictive reliability to deep interpersonal commitment, so the unification risks triviality: everything dependably usable\u2014from a subway map to a can-opener\u2014could then count as \u201cobjective.\u201d  The present essay argues that the trust/objectivity link is genuine but needs sharpening.  More precisely:\n\nThesis: The various senses of scientific objectivity name institutionalised strategies for generating *publicly checkable grounds* for trust\u2014grounds whose availability does not depend on trusting any particular person or group.  What unifies the senses is not trust *simpliciter*, but the way each embeds mechanisms that *transfer* warranted reliance from individual testimony to impersonal features of a practice.  An investigation counts as objective exactly to the extent that it makes that transfer possible by satisfying four jointly sufficient conditions: transparency, independence, robustness, and answerability.\n\nThe rest of the essay unfolds as follows. Section 2 clarifies \u201ctrust\u201d by separating it from neighbouring notions (reliance, confidence, deference). Section 3 analyses how each of the three standard kinds of objectivity implements the four conditions, thereby grounding warranted trust. Section 4 synthesises the lessons into a unifying account and formulates the four conditions precisely. Section 5 addresses three objections: (i) scientific communities often demand trust in persons (e.g. experts); (ii) objectivity cannot be reduced to social conditions because truth is at stake; and (iii) feminist and standpoint critiques show that \u201cimpersonal\u201d criteria can mask power. Section 6 closes by gesturing to implications for science policy and public communication.\n\n2. Disentangling Trust  \n\n2.1 Reliance versus Trust  \nSuppose you flip a light switch. You *rely* on the wiring but do not *trust* it in any interpersonal sense; wires are not capable of goodwill or betrayal. If the light fails, no relationship is damaged. Trust is usually taken to involve (a) acceptance of dependence, (b) an expectation that the trusted party will display goodwill or at least non-malevolent competence, and (c) a normative stance that betrayal would warrant blame.  Scientific objectivity cannot plausibly require goodwill\u2014microscopes have none\u2014so the Fine/Douglas proposal must be read in terms of *epistemic trust*: a readiness to take up an assertion or result as a guide to belief and action despite one\u2019s inability to verify every step personally.\n\n2.2 Direct versus Mediated Trust  \nI may trust Alice the climatologist directly: I believe her about radiative forcing because I judge her to be competent and sincere. Alternatively, I may trust her *indirectly* via the disciplinary structures that attest to her work: peer review, archiving of data, replication studies, etc. The indirect mode allows me to trust outputs while suspending judgment about any particular contributor.  The claim that objectivity grounds trust must therefore refer to *mediated* trust.\n\n2.3 First-Person versus Public Trust  \nEven if I am convinced, that proves little about public warrant. The distinctive aim of objectivity, I propose, is to make trust reasonable for *any* competent inquirer, including actual and counterfactual critics. Scientific objectivity is thus tied not to *my* psychology but to the *public availability* of grounds for trust. That emphasis will shape the formal account in Section 4.\n\n3. How the Three Standard Notions Ground Public Trust  \n\n3.1 Procedural Objectivity  \nThink of the kilogram prototype that once sat in S\u00e8vres, or of spectrophotometric assays that yield the same absorbance regardless of operator.  Such procedures build trust by *neutralising idiosyncrasy*: if a result depends only on following an explicit, scrutable protocol, any critic can in principle audit or replicate it without trusting the original measurer.  In our terms, procedural objectivity secures transparency (the protocol is explicit) and independence (properly trained operators are fungible). Robustness and answerability are supplied vicariously: a standard can be calibrated against other standards, and anomalies must be explained.\n\n3.2 Convergent (Intersubjective) Objectivity  \nEven without explicit protocols, wide and methodologically diverse agreement\u2014e.g. on the age of the universe\u2014creates a presumption of reliability.  Here, trust arises from *robustness across epistemic paths*: errors and biases that afflict one method are unlikely to afflict all independently.  Convergence therefore satisfies independence (different investigators) and robustness (many paths, same result).  Transparency is weaker: I may not know the details of every measurement, but the plurality of sources makes individual opacity less threatening.  Answerability is present because dissenters can target whichever path seems problematic; if the result stands, its warrant is strengthened.\n\n3.3 Interactive (Critical-Deliberative) Objectivity  \nHelen Longino and Peter Galison emphasise organised criticism: seminar rooms, journals, replication attempts, adversarial collaborations.  Interactive objectivity earns trust through *answerability*: every claim must withstand informed, open challenge.  When processes of criticism are functioning, even hidden assumptions come to light, satisfying transparency by indirect route and fostering robustness (hypotheses are tested under a variety of probing contexts).  Independence is produced not by separateness of investigators but by the structured contest of viewpoints.\n\nTaken together, the three senses implement overlapping mechanisms that channel warranted trust away from personal authority and toward features that any sufficiently engaged critic can check, replicate or challenge.\n\n4. A Unified Account: Four Conditions for Publicly Checkable Trust  \n\nThe preceding analysis suggests that objectivity is best understood as a *second-order epistemic good*: it does not guarantee truth but structures inquiry so that acceptance of results is rationally permitted absent personal vetting.  The core aim is to *transfer* dependence from particular knowers to *impersonal, publicly accessible grounds*.  Call this transfer \u201cepistemic depersonalisation.\u201d  Depersonalisation succeeds when four conditions hold:\n\n1. Transparency: Enough information about the generation of a claim is publicly available that a critic can in principle locate potential failure points.  This ranges from full protocols to archival access to raw data.\n\n2. Independence: The paths by which evidence is generated or assessed are not all subject to a single source of bias or control.  Independence may be procedural (operator fungibility), methodological (different instruments), or social (plurality of research groups).\n\n3. Robustness: The claim continues to receive support under variations in background assumptions, methods, or contexts.  Robustness functions as a stress test guarding against coincidental agreement or unnoticed error.\n\n4. Answerability: There exist social mechanisms that oblige claimants to respond to relevant challenges, with penalties (reputational or institutional) for stone-walling.  Answerability ensures that the previous three conditions are maintained over time.\n\nObjectivity, so conceived, is the property of practices, not merely of individual results.  A measurement or theory counts as objective only derivatively, by being the upshot of an *ongoing* practice that satisfies 1-4 to a degree sufficient for its cognitive stakes.\n\nThe four conditions explain why the three traditional senses feel unified despite their surface differences: each is a partial realisation of depersonalisation.\n\n5. Objections and Replies  \n\nObjection 1: Science often relies on *personal* expertise; laypersons trust climate scientists because they cannot audit raw data.  Therefore transparency and independence are aspirational, not actual sources of trust.\n\nReply: The account requires *public availability in principle*, not universal uptake in fact.  Few citizens will download satellite data, but *someone* could, and critics routinely do.  The possibility structure, rather than mass participation, grounds rational public trust.  This mirrors legal notions of \u201cdue process\u201d: one need not litigate to benefit from procedural fairness.\n\nObjection 2: Objectivity must be about truth, not merely social vindication.  A well-structured but deluded consensus (e.g. 19th-century phlogiston chemistry) would satisfy 1-4 yet be false.  So the account collapses objectivity into epistemic legitimacy, severing it from truth.\n\nReply: The objection conflates *epistemic* and *metaphysical* conceptions of objectivity.  Scientists pursue truth, but whether they have attained it is never fully inspectable.  The function of objectivity in practice is to *license trust* in the interim, subject to revision.  That is why even refuted theories such as Newtonian gravitation were objective in their day\u2014they met the four conditions, making reliance rational until better evidence emerged.  Objectivity is thus best read as a *diachronic property of inquiry* relative to available evidence, not as a guarantee of final truth.\n\nObjection 3: Feminist and post-colonial critiques allege that \u201cimpersonal\u201d standards can smuggle in dominant perspectives.  The very choice of which methods count as robust may exclude marginalised voices.  Therefore the four conditions tacitly privilege existing power structures.\n\nReply: The dependence of objectivity on *actual* social diversity is a feature, not a bug.  Since independence and answerability require plural viewpoints, homogeneity weakens objectivity.  The account therefore allies with, rather than ignores, standpoint concerns: expanding participation is *intrinsically* tied to improving objectivity, because it widens the range of potential error exposures.  Moreover, the four conditions furnish diagnostic tools: if transparency is blocked by proprietary data, or if answerability fails because journals disregard work from the global South, objectivity is compromised.\n\n6. Implications and Concluding Thoughts  \n\n6.1 Policy and Communication  \nWhen public agencies claim that a guideline (say, on vaccine safety) is \u201cobjective,\u201d sceptics sometimes retort that the data could be \u201cfaked\u201d or \u201cpoliticised.\u201d  Our analysis suggests a fruitful shift: instead of urging blind trust in experts, agencies should demonstrate that each of the four conditions is met\u2014open data portals (transparency), independent replication (independence), stress-tests under variant assumptions (robustness), and channels for responsive critique (answerability).  Framing outreach in these terms concretises what \u201cobjective\u201d means in practice.\n\n6.2 Internal Scientific Norms  \nLaboratory notebooks, data-sharing mandates, preregistration, registered reports, adversarial collaborations\u2014each can be seen as a tool for depersonalisation.  Recognising this structural role reveals why certain reforms matter: they are not bureaucratic hurdles but mechanisms for generating *publicly checkable grounds* for trust, especially crucial in fields (e.g. social psychology) where replication crises indicate failures of robustness and answerability.\n\n6.3 Future Research  \nThe account invites quantitative operationalisation: one might measure transparency by the completeness of metadata, independence by citation-cluster diversity, robustness by sensitivity analyses, and answerability by the speed and openness of post-publication peer review.  That research program could offer policymakers a gradient of objectivity rather than a binary label.\n\n6.4 Final Summary  \nObjectivity should not be equated with an absence of subjectivity, nor with an impossibly Archimedean God\u2019s-eye view.  It is better conceived as a set of *institutionalised antidotes* to the epistemic risks that dependence on other humans inevitably creates.  Trust remains central, but only in a refined sense: objectivity gives us *grounds* to trust without creating a vulnerable dependency on any particular source.  By analysing how procedural, convergent, and interactive senses of objectivity each realise four conditions\u2014transparency, independence, robustness, and answerability\u2014we gain both a unified framework for philosophical discussion and a practical compass for evaluating scientific claims in an era awash with misinformation.", "output_tokens": 2929, "reasoning_tokens": 320}

Introduction: Good\u2010Faith Humility about the Word \u201cObjective\u201d\n\nPhilosophers of science often start with an observation that is as sociological as it is epistemological: when scientists call a result \u201cobjective,\u201d they thereby invite\u2014or demand\u2014public trust. Arthur Fine, Heather Douglas, Helen Longino, Naomi Oreskes, and others correctly notice the rhetorical force of the label. But if we try to reverse the direction of explanation\u2014\u201cobjective simply means trustable\u201d\u2014the account quickly frays. Many things are trusted without being objective (e.g., one\u2019s spouse\u2019s memory), and some things may be objective in the technical sense yet fail to be trusted (e.g., climate\u2010model projections in polarized political contexts). The task, then, is to articulate a sharper relation between objectivity and trust and to ask whether the disparate senses of objectivity can be unified in a non\u2010trivial way.\n\nThesis. The several senses of scientific objectivity are unified not by any shared intrinsic feature but by a common functional role: each is a strategy for rendering epistemic dependence non\u2010arbitrary, thereby underwriting justified trust. Objectivity, so understood, is not identical with trustworthiness; it is the engineered reliability of a result under specified independence conditions that make an epistemic agent entitled to trust it. The various \u201ckinds\u201d of objectivity\u2014procedural, convergent, interactive, and so on\u2014differ in the mechanisms they deploy to neutralize idiosyncratic influences, yet they converge on the single function of managing epistemic dependence among agents, instruments, and inferential steps. Put abstractly: objectivity is the robustness of an epistemic product with respect to a reference class of variant inputs, and it is that robustness that makes trust rational.\n\n2. Conceptual Preliminaries: Trust, Trustworthiness, and Objectivity\n\n2.1 Trust vs. Trustworthiness    \n\nTrust is an attitude: A trusts B to do X when A adopts a stance of optimistic reliance on B\u2019s performing X, typically coupled with a disposition to feel betrayed if B fails (Baier). Trustworthiness is a property: B is trustworthy with respect to X if B is disposed to act (or deliver information) reliably and in a way responsive to the reliance of A. Trust can be misplaced; trustworthiness can go unnoticed. Therefore \u201cobjective = trusted\u201d conflates an attitude with a property.\n\n2.2 Core Notion of Objectivity    \n\nDespite long\u2010running debates (Hacking, Daston & Galison), a minimal consensus holds: calling a claim objective means that its truth or accuracy is, in some sense, independent of individual idiosyncrasies\u2014personal biases, unique vantage points, wishful thinking. This yields a negative characterization: objectivity is freedom from certain contaminating factors. But the negation strategy (objectivity = non\u2010subjectivity) is thin and uninformative. We need a positive account that both (i) explains why objective claims merit trust and (ii) illuminates why different operationalizations (procedures, convergence, critical interaction) count as legitimate manifestations of objectivity.\n\n3. Why \u201cObjective = Trustable\u201d Won\u2019t Do\n\n3.1 Trust without Objectivity    \n\nEveryday testimonial trust often turns on personal familiarity rather than impartial procedures: you believe your friend about where the restaurant is despite the absence of double\u2010blind testing or independent replication. Trust may be justified on grounds (e.g., character, shared history) that have nothing to do with objectivity.\n\n3.2 Objectivity without Social Trust    \n\nConversely, many technically objective results fail to garner public confidence: evolutionary biology textbooks in certain school districts, or statistically robust climate data among skeptics. Thus trust is neither necessary nor sufficient for objectivity.\n\n3.3 The Missing Middle Term: Epistemic Entitlement    \n\nWhat we need is a mediating notion: objectivity produces a standing to be trusted\u2014a warrant or entitlement. Whether the public actually extends trust depends on sociopolitical factors; the entitlement, however, is grounded in how the result was produced. The job of philosophy is to specify that ground.\n\n4. A Functional Unity: Objectivity as Management of Epistemic Dependence\n\nScientists must rely on each other\u2019s specialized labor, on instruments they did not build, on statistical packages they did not code. This unavoidable epistemic dependence is the soil in which worries about bias and error take root. Procedures of objectivity are, I propose, *technologies of dependence management*. They aim to ensure that when A relies on B\u2019s output, B\u2019s idiosyncrasies have been filtered out or their impact is canceled in aggregate.\n\n4.1 Procedural Objectivity    \n\nDouble\u2010blind trials, calibration protocols, and standardized operating procedures reduce the influence of any one experimenter\u2019s expectations or errors. They create *impersonality*: any competent practitioner following the recipe would arrive at the same data. The dependence of downstream users on the original experimenter is thus rendered benign.\n\n4.2 Convergent Objectivity    \n\nIndependent replications, meta\u2010analyses, and consilience across data streams deliver *inter\u2010subjective invariance*: multiple, loosely coupled pathways yield the same signal. Here the mechanism is statistical: uncorrelated idiosyncratic errors cancel out, making the remaining pattern resilient. Dependence is spread across agents; no single participant need be saintly.\n\n4.3 Interactive Objectivity    \n\nHeterogeneous research communities engage in critical scrutiny (Longino). By bringing diverse value perspectives into organized contestation, they expose background assumptions that would otherwise remain invisible to in\u2010group members. Objectivity arises from the *structured friction* among perspectives, which renders collective results insensitive to any one vantage point. Again, dependence is tamed by diversification.\n\nThese forms look dissimilar in surface grammar (recipes vs. consensus vs. critique), but each realizes the same underlying design principle: mitigate the epistemic risk introduced by asymmetric dependence.\n\n5. A Positive Definition: Robustness under a Reference Class of Variations\n\nTo sharpen the unifying core, import a notion from statistical physics and model theory: *invariance*. Let an epistemic product P (measurement, model, inference) be objective relative to a reference class R of potential perturbations if and only if P remains stable under every transformation in R. The precise choice of R depends on context:\n\n\u2022 For procedural objectivity, R = admissible variations in experimenter expectations and local conditions.  \n\u2022 For convergent objectivity, R = admissible variations in investigators, laboratories, and instrumentation.  \n\u2022 For interactive objectivity, R = admissible variations in background value\u2010orientations.\n\nOn this view, scientific objectivity is not monolithic but parameterized by which perturbations are being neutralized. The function is unified; the methods diverge in the instantiation of R. The link to trustworthiness now tightens: if a consumer judges that the relevant perturbations are indeed neutralized, she is rationally entitled to trust the output, even if, sociologically, she withholds trust.\n\n6. Objections and Replies\n\nObjection 1 (Value\u2010free ideal). Some hold that objectivity requires eliminating all nonepistemic values. Yet interactive conceptions explicitly *invite* moral or social values into the critical process. Does the functional account dissolve into relativism?  \n\nReply. The reference\u2010class framework subsumes value\u2010free and value\u2010laden ideals as special cases. If one thinks *all* social values threaten epistemic reliability, one sets R accordingly. If, like Douglas, one thinks certain values improve reliability by highlighting neglected risks, one assigns those values outside R. The question becomes empirical: which transformations destabilize results? Objectivity is not relativized to partisan preference but to demonstrable impact on reliability.\n\nObjection 2 (Standpoint epistemology). Feminist and postcolonial theorists argue that marginalized standpoints can reveal phenomena opaque to dominant groups. Isn\u2019t the neutrality ideal therefore self\u2010defeating?  \n\nReply. Standpoint theory fits naturally under interactive objectivity. Incorporating marginalized perspectives expands the space of potential critiques, enlarging R and thereby increasing robustness. The functional account vindicates the epistemic salience of diversity without abandoning the aspiration to trustworthiness.\n\nObjection 3 (Circularity). If objectivity is defined in terms of what we may rationally trust, and trust is licensed by objectivity, do we not have a circle?  \n\nReply. The circle is illusory once we distinguish attitude and property. Objectivity is specified by robustness under perturbations; whether that robustness suffices for rational trust is a further normative thesis, but not a definitional identity. One could grant the robustness and still refuse to trust for pragmatic reasons (e.g., high stakes). No circular dependency arises.\n\n7. Illustrative Cases\n\n7.1 The Polio Vaccine Trials (1954)    \n\nJonas Salk\u2019s vaccine was tested in a randomized, double\u2010blind, placebo\u2010controlled field trial involving 1.8 million children. Procedural objectivity lay in blinding and randomization; convergent objectivity came later through replications worldwide. The public was entitled to trust the efficacy results because the design eliminated experimenter expectations (procedural R) and because later studies exhibited cross\u2010site robustness (convergent R). The strategy succeeded: uptake was rapid, and polio incidence plummeted.\n\n7.2 Gravitational Wave Detection (LIGO)    \n\nThe 2015 LIGO detection used two geographically separated interferometers. Each served as an independent replication; sophisticated data\u2010analysis pipelines ensured that spurious local vibrations were filtered. Strict protocols prevented analysts from seeing whether a candidate event was real or injected as a \u201cblind\u201d test signal. Here robustness under R included variations in geographic location, instrumental noise, and analyst expectations\u2014simultaneously invoking all three senses of objectivity. Trust in the signal grew proportional to the layered neutralization of perturbations.\n\n7.3 COVID\u201019 Policy Models    \n\nDuring the pandemic, epidemiological models displayed wide variance. Critics charged \u201clack of objectivity,\u201d but the deeper problem was misalignment on R. Modelers treated certain parameters (e.g., human compliance) as exogenous and uncontrolled; policymakers implicitly assumed invariance across them. Once the mismatch was diagnosed, interactive objectivity improved: social scientists integrated behavioral data, reducing the class of uncontrolled perturbations and thereby increasing warranted trust.\n\n8. Broader Payoff: From Method Talk to Epistemic Engineering\n\nThe functional account treats objectivity as a design parameter in the construction of epistemic machinery. Just as engineers identify load cases and ensure structural integrity across them, scientists identify perturbation classes and build methods that confer robustness. Two consequences follow:\n\n(1) Pluralism without relativism. Because R is context\u2010dependent, talk of *the* method guaranteeing objectivity is misguided. Yet not all R\u2019s are equally good; they can be evaluated by how well they track actual destabilizing factors. Thus pluralism is disciplined by empirical feedback.\n\n(2) Prospect for better science communication. Public mistrust often stems from opacity about which perturbations have been neutralized. Explaining objectivity functionally\u2014\u201cHere are the variations in perspective, laboratory conditions, and value assumptions we controlled for\u201d\u2014translates arcane methodological details into a narrative about dependence management that lay audiences can appraise.\n\n9. Comparisons with Fine and Douglas\n\nArthur Fine\u2019s \u201cNOA\u201d (Natural Ontological Attitude) urges us to accept successful science at face value without further metaphysics; objectivity is bundled with that success and so merits trust. Heather Douglas emphasizes moral responsibility in policy\u2010relevant science and locates objectivity partly in transparent value judgments. Both see trust as central, but their accounts sometimes slide from warrant to sociology. The present proposal retains Douglas\u2019s insight that values can enhance reliability and Fine\u2019s emphasis on lived scientific practice, yet it identifies a precise epistemic function\u2014robustness under variant perturbations\u2014that clarifies how trust can be justified even in contentious contexts.\n\n10. Conclusion\n\nObjectivity and trust are intimately related, but not by identity. Objectivity is best understood functionally: it is the engineered robustness of an epistemic product under a relevant class of perturbations, thereby entitling epistemic agents to rely on it. Procedural, convergent, and interactive forms of objectivity are distinct implementations of the same design principle\u2014managing dependence by neutralizing the idiosyncratic. Recognizing this unity preserves the plurality of scientific methods while providing a clear criterion for when the label \u201cobjective\u201d is warranted. Consequently, debates about objectivity should focus less on policing metaphysical purity and more on the concrete engineering question: Have we controlled for the perturbations that matter? If the answer is yes, trust is rational\u2014even if, sociologically, it still needs to be earned.", "output_tokens": 3149, "reasoning_tokens": 512}

Introduction: Why Trust Is Too Thin a Glue\n\nFor more than a century, pleas for \u201cobjectivity\u201d have functioned as the highest compliment that can be paid to a scientific result.  In recent decades, however, philosophers have insisted that there is no single property called Objectivity.  Instead we speak of \u201cprocedural objectivity\u201d (following strict protocols), \u201cmeasurement objectivity\u201d (instrument\u2010based stability), \u201cconvergent objectivity\u201d (agreement across methods), \u201cinteractive objectivity\u201d (structured critical dialogue), and so on.  Faced with this motley, Arthur Fine, Heather Douglas, and others have proposed an attractive slogan: all these notions earn the honorific \u201cobjective\u201d because they license trust.  When we say a measurement is objective, we are really saying \u201cyou can trust it.\u201d\n\nThe slogan is on the right track; objectivity does, in some sense, underwrite trust.  But the linkage is too imprecise to do explanatory work, because \u201ctrust\u201d itself is equivocal and because not every ground for trust confers objectivity (we may trust a friend\u2019s promise or a benevolent God).  What is needed is an account of:\n\na) the specific kind of trust at stake in scientific practice;  \nb) why the quite different senses of objectivity all promote that trust; and  \nc) whether any deeper unity makes \u201cobjectivity\u201d more than a mere honorific for whatever scientists value.\n\nMy thesis is this: the disparate senses of scientific objectivity are unified not by generic trust but by their shared function of managing epistemic risk in a distributed social setting.  \u201cObjective\u201d marks those practices that insulate the product of inquiry from the idiosyncratic cognitive, moral, and material vulnerabilities of the inquirers, thereby making it rational for a plural audience to place impersonal\u2014and defeasible\u2014epistemic trust in the product.  The best way to sharpen the slogan, then, is to understand objectivity as a family of \u201cepistemic\u2010risk\u2010mitigation architectures\u201d that warrant a very specific species of trust: resilient, impersonal, and publicly transferable reliance on a claim.\n\nI proceed as follows.  (\u00a72) I clarify the notion of trust relevant to science.  (\u00a73) I articulate an account of objectivity as epistemic risk management and show how it fits the main historical senses.  (\u00a74) I consider four objections.  (\u00a75) I conclude by indicating how this framework illuminates current debates about reproducibility and value\u2010laden inquiry.\n\n2. What Kind of Trust?\n\n2.1 Trust versus Mere Reliance  \nTo rely on an alarm clock is simply to expect that it will ring.  To trust the alarm clock, by contrast, is to see its dependability as norm\u2010governed: if it fails, something went wrong and an explanation is owed.  Philosophers capture this by saying that trust is \u201cnormative\u2010expectational reliance\u201d involving a background of entitlement and accountability.\n\n2.2 Personal versus Impersonal Trust  \nWhen I trust my co\u2010author to finish a draft, my confidence is grounded partly in her good will toward me.  Impersonal or institutional trust, however, attaches to roles, rules, or systems (\u201cI trust the peer\u2010review process\u201d).  Scientific objectivity, I will argue, aims at impersonal trust.\n\n2.3 The Epistemic Dimension  \nFinally, epistemic trust is trust specifically in someone\u2019s (or something\u2019s) reliability as a source of knowledge or evidence.  It presupposes a recognized risk of error.  Eliminating error is impossible; the point is to reduce risk to a level that makes reliance rational for a broad community.\n\n3. Objectivity as Epistemic-Risk Mitigation\n\nBegin with an obvious but overlooked fact: doing science is risky.  Instruments drift, samples degrade, human observers cherry\u2010pick, funders exert pressure, and powerful theories lure us into wishful thinking.  Any consumer of scientific claims\u2014the climatologist reading a paleoclimate study, the physician reading a drug trial, the legislator reading an IPCC report\u2014must decide whether to trust the result without replicating it personally.  Which features of a study license that leap of faith?  My proposal is that the label \u201cobjective\u201d functions as a quick pointer to the presence of risk\u2010mitigating structures.\n\nI will call these structures Epistemic Risk-Mitigation Architectures (ERMAs).  An ERMA is a suite of material, procedural, and social devices the function of which is to make the truth of a claim relatively insensitive to factors we have reason to distrust: individual bias, local error, or undue influence.\n\nThe major senses of objectivity familiar from the literature can be re\u2010described as distinct ERMAs:\n\nA. Procedural Objectivity  \nHere we adopt precisely defined, openly available protocols (e.g., double\u2010blind randomization, calibration standards) so that personal judgment plays no discretionary role.  The risk mitigated is idiosyncratic bias.\n\nB. Measurement or Instrumental Objectivity  \nInstruments substitute for subjective observation (e.g., spectrometers replacing naked\u2010eye color matching).  The risk mitigated is the volatility and opacity of perceptual judgment.\n\nC. Convergent Objectivity  \nIndependent lines of evidence (e.g., tree rings, ice cores, and sediment data) converge on the same parameter.  The risk mitigated is theory\u2010mediated error and the underdetermination of conclusions by any single data set.\n\nD. Interactive or Critical Objectivity  \nStructured critical dialogue\u2014peer review, seminars, adversarial collaboration, public datasets\u2014 subjects claims to searching scrutiny.  The risk mitigated is the entrenchment of groupthink or disciplinary myopia.\n\nE. Structural or Values Objectivity (Douglas)  \nDistinct from the prior four, this concerns devices like conflict\u2010of\u2010interest disclosure and statistical power analysis that dampen the effects of social, political, or moral values on evidential standards.  The risk mitigated is wishful influence by extra\u2010epistemic interests.\n\nOnce these risk\u2010mitigation devices are in place, a third party gains a defeasible warrant to trust the output without firsthand acquaintance with the process.  Conversely, the absence or malfunction of an ERMA is regularly invoked to charge that a result is \u201cnot objective\u201d (sample sizes too small; blinding inadequate; conflict of interest undisclosed).  The unity of \u201cobjectivity,\u201d then, is functional: what counts as objective is whatever device or practice serves to make epistemic risk sufficiently low, relative to salient failure modes, that impersonal trust becomes rational.\n\n4. How the Unified Account Fits the Historical Senses\n\n4.1 Classical Laboratory Practice  \nConsider 19th-century precision metrology.  The French Bureau des Longitudes defined protocols for weighing the standard kilogram: instruments were placed under glass bell jars, operators wore gloves, procedures for controlling temperature and humidity were minutely detailed.  The point was not merely to standardize; it was to insulate the reading from the physiologic shakiness or national pride of any one operator.  That is exactly an ERMA.\n\n4.2 Convergence in Modern Cosmology  \nMeasurements of the Hubble constant come from Type-Ia supernovae, cosmic microwave background anisotropy, baryon acoustic oscillations, and strong lensing time delays.  Each method has distinct systematics.  When two or more agree, we trust the value in a way we would not if it were fixed by any single method.  Convergence here is a second\u2010order risk dampener: the probability that all methods err in the same direction becomes tiny, justifying trust by a heterogeneous audience of physicists with contentious priors.\n\n4.3 Interactive Objectivity in Climate Science  \nClimate\u2010model intercomparison projects (CMIP) publicly release code and data; teams run \u201cblind prediction\u201d experiments; hostile skeptics audit every line.  The community counts the resulting estimates objective precisely because the architecture forces confrontation with diverse objections and detects \u201cunknown unknowns.\u201d  Notice how this differs from procedural objectivity: what counts is not conformity to rules but the provision of fora for critical uptake by potentially unfriendly experts.\n\n4.4 Negative Test Case: The Reproducibility Crisis  \nA psychology study with p = .048, no pre\u2010registration, undisclosed exclusions, and researcher degrees of freedom galore lacks several risk attenuators.  Deeming its finding \u201cnon-objective\u201d is tantamount to saying: absent those ERMAs, epistemic trust would be reckless.  This diagnosis explains why reforms (pre\u2010registration, Registered Reports, larger samples) target precisely those deficits.\n\n5. Objections and Replies\n\nObjection 1: Reductionism.  You have reduced objectivity to \u201crisk reduction.\u201d  But truth matters too; a procedure could minimize some risks while still systematically missing reality.\n\nReply: The account is teleological, not reductionist.  An ERMA must be truth\u2010conducive relative to the identified failure mode; if it is not, it fails in its risk\u2010mitigating function and will not earn the \u201cobjective\u201d label in practice.  For instance, a measurement protocol insensitive to instrument drift will eventually be rejected as \u201cnot objective.\u201d  Risk mitigation is truth-directed, albeit indirectly.\n\nObjection 2: Value-Ladenness.  Douglas argues that some value judgments, especially about inductive risk, properly enter evidential standards.  Does this not undermine your \u201cimpersonal\u201d trust ideal?\n\nReply: Not at all.  Managing inductive risk involves specifying acceptable error rates under different social stakes.  Transparency about those value judgments can itself be an ERMA, allowing downstream users to calibrate their trust.  The framework predicts that when the value judgments are hidden, trust erodes (\u201cthat study was funded by Big Oil\u201d).  Impersonal trust is compatible with known, explicit value choices; it is secrecy or unexamined bias that raises epistemic risk.\n\nObjection 3: Unity Overstated.  Perhaps objectivity is simply an honorific; thinkers have retrofitted distinct merits under a single banner without real unity.\n\nReply: While the historical meanings did grow piecemeal, their convergence on the single function of epistemic\u2010risk mitigation is not accidental.  Hacking\u2019s \u201claboratory science,\u201d Shapin and Schaffer\u2019s \u201cvirtual witnessing,\u201d Longino\u2019s \u201ccritical discourse\u201d\u2014all emphasize control of error sources in communities.  The risk framework renders this shared tendency explicit and predicts future elaborations (e.g., algorithmic interpretability standards in machine learning).\n\nObjection 4: Circularity.  We identify ERMAs by seeing which practices scientists already call \u201cobjective,\u201d and then explain objectivity in terms of ERMAs.  Isn\u2019t that circular?\n\nReply: The charge confuses empirical classification with normative explanation.  We start by observing that certain practices are consistently labeled \u201cobjective.\u201d  We then ask what functional property makes them worth that label and find: they mitigate epistemic risk.  That explanatory property is not defined in terms of \u201cobjectivity\u201d and so no circle is traced.\n\n6. Advantages of the Risk-Mitigation Account\n\n1. Unification: It replaces a disjunctive list with a single functional genus.  \n2. Gradation: Because risk comes in degrees, objectivity becomes scalar rather than binary, matching scientific rhetoric (\u201cmore objective,\u201d \u201chighly objective\u201d).  \n3. Normative Guidance: It directs reform efforts.  If trust has eroded (e.g., in nutrition epidemiology), diagnose which risks are insufficiently damped and upgrade the architecture.  \n4. Compatibility with Social Epistemology: The account naturally incorporates the collective character of modern science; individual virtue is insufficient, systemic design is essential.  \n\n7. A Quick Application: Machine Learning and \u201cSynthetic Objectivity\u201d\n\nContemporary talk of \u201calgorithmic objectivity\u201d revives many confusions.  A hiring algorithm is sometimes advertised as objective because it applies a fixed scoring rule.  On my view, that counts as procedural objectivity but fails interactive objectivity (no scrutiny) and convergent objectivity (no independent lines).  Thus downstream users should modulate trust accordingly.  The framework yields actionable advice: open source the code, create adversarial audits, test against multiple datasets\u2014each an ERMA for novel risks like data drift and embedded bias.\n\n8. Conclusion\n\nScientific objectivity and trust are intimately connected, but the connection is mediated by the systematic management of epistemic risk in a social context.  The practices honored with the label \u201cobjective\u201d\u2014whether they involve standardized protocols, robust instruments, converging signals, or institutionalized criticism\u2014are those that render a claim resilient to the vagaries of individual psychology, local error, and corrupting interests.  That resilience warrants a distinctive, impersonal form of epistemic trust: the readiness of diverse audiences to rely on a result sight unseen, while holding the enterprise accountable should the architecture fail.\n\nIn short:\n\nObjective = possessing an epistemic-risk-mitigation architecture sufficient to justify resilient, impersonal trust.\n\nThis precisifies the Fine\u2013Douglas slogan and unifies the fractured landscape of objectivity concepts.  It also furnishes a practical tool: when trust in science wavers, the repair strategy is not to demand faith but to fortify the architectures that earn trust in the first place.", "output_tokens": 3369, "reasoning_tokens": 576}

When we say that a result is \u201cobjective,\u201d we license reliance on it; when we call a procedure \u201cobjective,\u201d we invite others to lean on it instead of re-doing the work themselves.  But slogans like \u201cobjectivity is just what can be trusted\u201d leave two large philosophical tasks undone.  First, they elide the nature of trust, which is a relation between people (or institutions) and propositions, underwritten by expectations about competence and integrity.  Second, they obscure what the several entrenched senses of objectivity\u2014procedural, convergent, interactive, and others\u2014share, if anything, beyond a vague air of reliability.\n\nI will argue that the right way to relate the two notions is not definitional but hierarchical: scientific objectivity is a property of epistemic products or practices that makes certain kinds of trust in them reasonable.  The various senses of objectivity are unified, I claim, by a single structural feature: each is a species of error-blocking independence.  Objective results are those whose epistemic standing does not depend sensitively on any single idiosyncratic factor\u2014an individual\u2019s biases, a peculiarity of an instrument, a parochial background assumption, or a social pressure.  Because they enjoy this independence, they are apt for warranted trust.  Trust is the attitude; objectivity is the ground of warrant.\n\nThe dialectical pay-off is twofold.  First, we get a sharper picture of objectivity that distinguishes it from nearby virtues such as mere transparency or procedural regularity.  Second, we can explain why some kinds of trust (for example, trust in a charismatic but un-replicated experiment) are epistemically defective: they are not anchored in the right sort of independence.\n\nI.  What Kind of Thing Is Trust?\n\n\u201cTrust\u201d is often used promiscuously in philosophy of science.  But the literature on social epistemology and moral psychology converges on a three-part model.\n\n1.  Reliance: A trusts B with respect to p if A is disposed to act on p because B says (or has produced evidence that) p.  \n2.  Positivity of expectation: A expects B to be competent and benevolent enough not to mislead regarding p.  \n3.  Self-attribution of vulnerability: A recognises that if B is mistaken or deceptive, A will incur a loss\u2014practical, epistemic, or moral.\n\nTrust is therefore an attitude held by agents; it is relational and normative.  What objectivity might supply is the epistemic justification for this attitude.  That already hints that Fine\u2019s or Douglas\u2019s suggestion should be reversed: objectivity is not defined by trust, but trust is rationally grounded (when it is) by objectivity.\n\nII.  The Familiar Families of Objectivity\n\nPhilosophers catalogue several senses:\n\na.  Procedural (sometimes \u201cmechanical\u201d) objectivity: results obtained by following formalised, publicly specified methods\u2014think of blood-alcohol readings from a calibrated breathalyser.\n\nb.  Convergent objectivity: results that independent investigators reach despite employing diverse routes\u2014e.g., Avogadro\u2019s number derived from gas laws, electrochemistry, and crystal lattice spacings.\n\nc.  Interactive (or critical) objectivity: robustness gained through organised critical interaction within a community, \u00e0 la Helen Longino\u2019s \u201ctransformative criticism.\u201d\n\nd.  Ontic or invariance objectivity: the world itself exhibits the same structural features from multiple frames of reference (e.g., the rest-mass of the electron), making ascriptions standpoint-independent.\n\nWhat is the common denominator?  Critics complain that the list is a mere family resemblance cluster, united only by the honorific tag \u201cobjective.\u201d  My proposal is that each member of the cluster deploys one or another strategy for ensuring that the outcome is insensitive to parochial perturbations.\n\nIII.  From Error-Blocking to Warranted Trust\n\n1.  The independence principle.  \n   Call a factor F idiosyncratic relative to a question Q when F\u2019s influence on answers to Q is epistemically extraneous\u2014e.g., the particular mechanic\u2019s personal bias when measuring engine emissions.  A process delivers an objective answer to Q when, for all relevant idiosyncratic factors Fi in a specified reference class, removing or varying Fi does not alter (within tolerances) the answer produced.  \u201cRelevant\u201d and \u201creference class\u201d depend, of course, on background scientific aims; but the guiding idea is that objectivity is achieved by building error-blocking redundancy or neutralisation into the epistemic machinery.\n\n2.  How the principle structures the four senses.  \n   a.  Procedural objectivity explicitly neutralises the idiosyncrasy of human judgment by routinising the steps.  If a technician\u2019s mood cannot sway the breathalyser\u2019s algorithm, the result is independent of that human factor.  \n   b.  Convergent objectivity recruits diversity of evidential pathways; any single pathway\u2019s hidden assumption may be wrong, but independent convergence indicates that the shared conclusion is insensitive to each pathway\u2019s idiosyncrasies.  \n   c.  Interactive objectivity treats disciplinary, cultural, and theoretical commitments themselves as potential Fi\u2019s.  Open criticism forces claims to survive exposure to rival perspectives, thereby filtering out parochial presuppositions.  \n   d.  Ontic objectivity is the limiting case where what is asserted is invariant under relevant transformations of perspective, coordinate system, or gauge\u2014again, an independence condition this time guaranteed by the structure of physical law.\n\n3.  Trust piggy-backs on the same independence.  \n   A test result we are entitled to trust is one we need not re-examine for every hidden Fi; the institution that generated it has already insulated the answer from those factors.  Where that insulation is missing (a replication crisis lab, a single failed peer-review), we are epistemically unjustified in trusting.\n\nIV.  Why \u201cObjectivity = Trust\u201d Is Too Imprecise\n\nConsider four counter-examples.\n\na.  Misplaced but psychologically compelling trust.  Early 20th-century investors trusted phrenology charts.  Trust was present, objectivity absent.\n\nb.  Epistemic opacity plus objectivity.  LIGO\u2019s gravitational-wave detections rely on code inscrutable to most physicists.  Few end-users could say why the pipeline neutralises biases, but the result is nonetheless objective by my criterion.  We often have justified trust without understanding; the ground is independent robustness, not psychological assurance.\n\nc.  Conditional trust.  We might trust a temperature reading only within a certain range because we know the sensor drifts above 600 K.  Objectivity is range-relative; so is rational trust.  That refinement is lost if we identify the two notions.\n\nd.  Non-epistemic trust.  A friend can be trusted to keep a secret; this has nothing to do with objectivity.  Trust is the broader genus; objectivity a specific epistemic warrant within it.\n\nTogether these considerations push us toward a hierarchical, not definitional, link.\n\nV.  Objections and Replies\n\nObjection 1: The independence account collapses into mere reliability; why not say an objective method is just a reliable one?  \n\nReply: Reliability is a statistical outcome measure; independence explains why reliability is robust under variation of Fi.  A method may be modally fragile\u2014reliable only in a narrow run of circumstances\u2014and hence not objective.  A bathroom scale that reads correctly only at sea level is reliable in Seattle today but not independent of barometric variations; hence not objective for scientific mass determinations.\n\nObjection 2: Independence is too weak.  A conspiratorial group can produce results agreed upon by multiple independent-looking pathways, yet all tailored to mislead.  \n\nReply: The reference class of idiosyncratic factors must include coordinated deception.  Interactive objectivity explicitly counters this via transparency and critical scrutiny.  If deception is perfectly hidden from every possible critical vantage, then even idealised rational agents cannot detect it\u2014at which point the epistemic situation is symmetric with truth, and nothing stronger could be reasonably required.\n\nObjection 3: Some sciences (e.g., climate modelling) rely on complex simulation.  Independence from idiosyncratic factors is inevitably partial: modellers share core parameterisations.  Does your account deny their objectivity?\n\nReply: No.  Independence comes in degrees.  What counts as an idiosyncratic factor is indexed to the research context.  For climate science, acceptable independence is gained by running multi-model ensembles constructed by independently motivated groups.  The resulting spread of outcomes (the \u201censemble envelope\u201d) quantifies remaining dependence.  Objectivity is therefore scalar, not binary.\n\nVI.  Two Illustrative Cases\n\nCase 1: The kilogram redefinition.  \nUntil 2019, the international kilogram prototype in Paris slowly lost mass.  Procedural objectivity was compromised: reliance on a single artefact allowed Fi = contaminants and surface erosion to bias all calibrations.  Metrologists moved to a definition in terms of Planck\u2019s constant via the Kibble balance, along with silicon-sphere Avogadro experiments.  The convergent agreement of two physically independent technologies plus public traceability of the error budgets restored robustness.  Trust in mass standards is now warranted not merely because scientists tell us so but because multiple built-in independences block single-factor distortions.\n\nCase 2: The social psychology replication crisis.  \nMany canonical findings failed to replicate when independent labs tried new protocols.  Here, convergence and interactive objectivity exposed sensitivity to Fi\u2019s such as experimenter demand characteristics and small-sample statistics.  Trust appropriately declined once we learned that the original results lacked the requisite independence.  Subsequent reforms (pre-registration, multi-lab replications) aim explicitly at reinstating the error-blocking structure.\n\nVII.  From Independence to a More Precise Unifier\n\nWe can now propose a unifying definition:\n\nScientific objectivity is the property of an epistemic product or practice whereby its truth-value is (to a specified degree) invariant under the removal, substitution, or counterfactual variation of factors that are epistemically extraneous to the phenomenon under study.\n\nTrust, by contrast, is the doxastic and practical stance of relying on that product or practice, grounded (when justified) in one\u2019s belief that it possesses the above independence.  This formulation clarifies three points often blurred:\n\n1.  Normative direction: Objectivity \u2192 warrants \u2192 Trust, not vice versa.  \n2.  Pluralism explained: different senses of objectivity enumerate the institutional, procedural, and metaphysical strategies for securing invariance.  \n3.  Scalability: because invariance admits of degree, both objectivity and rational trust are matters of more or less, not all or nothing.\n\nVIII.  Implications and Further Research\n\n1.  Metrics for objectivity.  If objectivity is invariance, then statistical tools that quantify robustness across model specifications, instrumental calibrations, and social viewpoints can serve as objectivity indices.  Econometrics\u2019 sensitivity analyses or computer science\u2019s adversarial testing become philosophically salient.\n\n2.  Ethics of expertise.  Because trust is attitude-relative, the same measure of objectivity may warrant different practical reliances for different audiences depending on their vulnerability profiles.  A drought-stricken nation needs higher confidence in rainfall projections than a casual weather hobbyist.  Objectivity grounds trust, but how much trust to give remains a context-sensitive ethical decision.\n\n3.  Teaching science literacy.  Public controversies (vaccines, climate) often turn on whom to trust.  The independence account suggests pedagogical emphasis on explaining the community mechanisms\u2014peer review diversity, meta-analysis, double-blind protocols\u2014that constitute independence, rather than on re-deriving technical results.\n\n4.  Limits of objectivity.  Some claims\u2014first-person phenomenological reports, historical singular events\u2014may be forever hostage to unique perspectives.  Objectivity then asymptotes to transparency about sources of dependence rather than elimination of same.  A philosophy of \u201csituated objectivity\u201d can be articulated from the present framework.\n\nIX.  Conclusion\n\nThe impulse to equate objectivity with trust contains a core insight: objective science is science we can, and often must, rely on.  But a conceptual conflation threatens to trivialise both notions.  Trust is an interpersonal, vulnerability-laden attitude that may be epistemically justified or not.  Objectivity is one, notably powerful, condition that justifies it.  What unifies the disparate senses of objectivity is not psychological reassurance but a common architecture of error-blocking independence\u2014achieved through mechanical procedure, evidential convergence, critical interaction, or invariance of the target system itself.  When that architecture is sound, trust is rational; when it is faulty, trust is betrayed.  Distinguishing the two clarifies both our epistemology and our politics of expertise, showing how serious philosophical analysis can illuminate the everyday but consequential question: whom, and what, should we trust?", "output_tokens": 3316, "reasoning_tokens": 576}

Introduction and Thesis  \n\u201cObjective\u201d and \u201ctrustworthy\u201d are terms so often uttered in the same breath that it is tempting to identify them. Arthur Fine tells us that to call a result objective is just to say \u201cwe can trust it.\u201d Heather Douglas likewise claims that scientific objectivity is \u201cthat which warrants trust.\u201d Such proposals are attractive, yet they leave something important unsaid. Trust is an attitude a person adopts toward another person, product, or institution; objectivity is a property we ascribe to the research process or its deliverances. They sit at different logical levels. What we need, therefore, is an account of how the property (objectivity) grounds the attitude (trust), and of what, exactly, unifies the diverse kinds of objectivity philosophers of science have catalogued\u2014procedural, convergent, interactive, and others.\n\nMy thesis is two-fold.\n\n1. Scientific objectivity, in all its recognized varieties, is best understood as resilience of epistemic outputs under a specified range of perspective changes\u2014what I shall call invariance under relevant transformations.  \n2. Trust is a rational response to (perceived) invariance: when we see that a claim survives the substitution of methods, observers, values, and theoretical frameworks, we acquire good reason to rely on it. Thus objectivity justifies but does not constitute trust.\n\nThis invariance-based account explains why the usual taxonomic species of objectivity belong in the same genus: each species protects invariance in a different way. It also reveals in what sense Fine and Douglas are right\u2014objectivity licenses trust\u2014while correcting the impression that \u201cobjective\u201d simply means \u201ctrusted.\u201d\n\nThe argument proceeds as follows. Section 2 clarifies the varieties of objectivity and shows how each embodies a strategy for securing invariance. Section 3 analyzes the concept of trust and distinguishes it from the property that warrants it. Section 4 articulates the invariance account and demonstrates its unifying power. Section 5 responds to objections; Section 6 sketches implications for science and society; Section 7 concludes.\n\n2. The Varieties of Objectivity Revisited  \nPhilosophers have identified at least three families of objectivity.\n\n2.1 Procedural objectivity (Hacking, Porter)  \nA result is procedurally objective when it flows from a standardized, rule-governed method that minimizes the need for individual judgment: think of double-blind trials, calibrated instruments, or computer-generated statistics. The guiding idea is impersonality. By replacing idiosyncratic choices with algorithms or protocols, we seek results that would be the same whoever ran the experiment.\n\n2.2 Convergent or robust objectivity (Nagel, Wimsatt)  \nHere the hallmark is agreement among multiple, independent lines of evidence. Gravitation-wave detections were accepted because laser interferometry, radio-pulsar timing, and numerical relativity all pointed to the same parameters. The claim\u2019s resilience across techniques and laboratories provides the warrant.\n\n2.3 Interactive (or social) objectivity (Longino, Douglas)  \nAccording to Helen Longino, knowledge is objective when it emerges from a critical dialogue among differently situated observers who expose one another\u2019s background assumptions. For Douglas, objectivity requires the explicit management of value judgments through transparent community deliberation. In each case, the discipline\u2019s social structure serves as a check on any single standpoint.\n\nThese families can proliferate. Ian Hacking speaks of \u201contological objectivity\u201d (mind-independent reality), Jim Woodward of \u201cmanipulability,\u201d and so forth. The challenge is to find a concept capacious enough to embrace them all without collapsing into vacuity.\n\n3. What Trust Is\u2014and Is Not  \nTrust is not mere reliability belief. I may rely on the sunrise without trusting the sun. Philosophical accounts (Baier, Hardin, Jones) converge on two features:\n\n1. Voluntary vulnerability: by trusting, I place myself at risk should the trusted object fail.  \n2. Normative expectation: I take there to be grounds (moral, epistemic, or practical) for that reliance and for potential reproach if the grounds are betrayed.\n\nTrust thus presupposes a background of reasons. If objectivity is to ground trust, it must supply such reasons.\n\nImportantly, the relation is asymmetrical. We can have objective results that are not trusted (climate models among skeptics), and we can have trust where objectivity is low (ritual healing within a community). Objectivity therefore cannot be identical with trust; rather, it provides an epistemic basis for a certain subset of justified trust relationships.\n\n4. Invariance Under Relevant Transformations: A Unifying Core  \n4.1 The guiding metaphor  \nConsider a map. We call it \u201cobjective\u201d insofar as the distances it portrays remain accurate whether measured with a ruler, a piece of string, or digital software. Analogously, a scientific statement is objective to the degree that its epistemic status\u2014its probability or evidential support\u2014remains stable under a family of transformations: changes in observers, instruments, theoretical background, and social values that would reasonably be expected to perturb a merely subjective belief.\n\nFormally (loosely adapting robustness analysis), let p be a scientific claim and T a set of transformations representing perspective-changes deemed relevant in the context. Claim p is objectively warranted to degree d just in case for each \u03c4 in T, the evidential support function E satisfies |E(p) \u2013 E\u03c4(p)| \u2264 d. When d is small, one has high objectivity.\n\n4.2 How the varieties fit  \n\na. Procedural objectivity constrains the transformation \u201cswap observer A for observer B.\u201d Standardized protocols and mechanical substitutes are devices for ensuring E and E\u03c4 coincide regardless of who runs the experiment.\n\nb. Convergent objectivity targets the transformation \u201creplace evidential route r1 with r2.\u201d Multiple independent lines of support create invariance across investigative methods.\n\nc. Interactive objectivity addresses the transformation \u201creplace one perspective-laden background assumption set with another.\u201d By subjecting claims to a plurivocal critical community, the discipline ensures that E remains robust across value or standpoint shifts.\n\nWhat unites these is not impersonality per se, nor consensus, nor social deliberation; each is merely a strategy for safeguarding invariance.\n\n4.3 Why invariance grounds trust  \nIf I see that a claim is insensitive to who measured, how it was measured, and what background attitudes prevailed, I have reason to believe it will also hold in the further contexts where I plan to use it. This expectation of cross-context stability is precisely what rationalizes my willingness to stake practical or theoretical projects on it: in short, to trust.\n\nThe relation is explanatory, not constitutive:\n\nObjectivity (invariance) \u27f9 Rational warrant \u27f9 Justified trust.\n\nFine and Douglas focus on the rightmost arrow. The middle arrow, however, is where philosophical work is needed, and invariance supplies the missing link.\n\n5. Objections and Replies  \n\nObjection 1: Invariance collapses into mere reliability; why introduce new jargon?  \nReply: Reliability is global frequency of truth; invariance is modal stability across specified perspective-shifts. A thermometer may be reliable in stable lab conditions yet vary wildly with humidity; it lacks objectivity in the present sense. The distinction matters for experimental design.\n\nObjection 2: Some genuine objective claims are perspectival\u2014e.g., gauge choices in physics. Transformation invariance over-states neutrality.  \nReply: The set T must be contextually delimited. Choices known to be merely conventional (gauges, coordinate systems) are excluded because scientists possess transformation rules translating between representations. Objectivity requires invariance with respect to epistemically significant differences, not arbitrary differences.\n\nObjection 3: Interactive objectivity emphasizes values and moral considerations, not just perspective variability. Can such \u201cnorm-laden\u201d aspects be reduced to invariance?  \nReply: Values enter as potential sources of bias\u2014forms of perspective. Managing them openly expands the set T to include value-profiles. If claims survive those variations, they count as objective. The account honors Douglas\u2019s insight without equating objectivity with moral acceptability.\n\nObjection 4: Lay distrust of vaccines persists despite high invariance. So objectivity cannot be what justifies trust in practice.  \nReply: The thesis concerns rational warrant, not sociological uptake. When uptake fails, the culprit is misinformation, not a deficit in objectivity. The account still predicts that, were agents accurately apprised of the invariance, trust would be justified.\n\n6. Implications  \n\n6.1 Diagnosing the replication crisis  \nSome psychological findings failed replication because their evidential support was fragile under method and lab change\u2014exactly a breakdown of invariance. The remedy aligns with our account: pre-registration, multi-lab replications, and open data increase invariance and thereby restore warrant for trust.\n\n6.2 Expertise and public policy  \nWhen agencies like the IPCC craft consensus reports, they layer convergent, procedural, and interactive strategies: climate reconstructions draw on satellite, ground, and proxy data; the process is transparent and multi-disciplinary. The resulting high-invariance output justifies governmental trust even under divergent political value-sets.\n\n6.3 Rethinking peer review  \nTraditional peer review emphasizes procedural competence but not necessarily cross-method robustness. Incorporating replication badges or triangulation requirements would align publication standards with an invariance conception of objectivity, hence modulate which findings earn society\u2019s trust.\n\n7. Conclusion  \nObjectivity and trust are entwined but distinct. Objectivity is a property of scientific claims, processes, or institutions\u2014specifically, the resilience of their epistemic support under relevant transformations of perspective. Trust is a rational attitude we adopt in light of recognized resilience. Procedural, convergent, and interactive objectivity are not rival theories but complementary strategies for securing invariance along different dimensions. Fine and Douglas are therefore half-right: objectivity is what makes trust appropriate. What unifies the senses of objectivity, however, is not the attitude it occasions but the stability that occasions the attitude. Recognizing this helps us understand both how scientific knowledge earns its authority and how that authority can be lost or regained.", "output_tokens": 2872, "reasoning_tokens": 704}

Introduction: why \u201cobjectivity = trust\u201d will not do  \n\nWhen philosophers such as Arthur Fine say that calling a result \u2018objective\u2019 amounts to \u201csaying that we can trust it,\u201d the claim is attractive but slippery. It is attractive because the motivational force behind objectivity-talk is indeed the desire to sort those scientific deliverances on which we may rely from those we must treat with suspicion. It is slippery because \u201ctrust\u201d is itself a rich, multi-place relation (A trusts B to do C in virtue of D) that mixes epistemic, pragmatic, and moral dimensions. If we treat objectivity as simply \u201cthat which can be trusted,\u201d we threaten to lose sight of what is distinctive about the several historically important senses of objectivity\u2014\u200bprocedural, convergent, interactive, and so on.  \n\nThe task, then, is two-fold: (i) clarify how objectivity and trust are related, and (ii) show what, if anything, unifies the disparate senses of objectivity once that relation is rendered more precise. My thesis will be:\n\nThesis. \u2018Objective\u2019 is best understood as marking a special kind of epistemic robustness: a belief, datum, or method is objective to the extent that it remains stable across legitimate variations in perspective. Epistemic trust is warranted precisely when such robustness obtains. Hence objectivity is not identical with trust; rather, it is the property in virtue of which trust\u2014specifically, voluntary epistemic reliance\u2014is rationally permitted. The unity of the diverse senses of objectivity lies in the way each manages perspective-dependence: procedural objectivity neutralizes individual perspective via standardized method; convergent objectivity neutralizes it via independent replication; interactive objectivity does so via critical uptake within a pluralistic community. All are species of the genus \u201cperspective-robustness.\u201d\n\nI proceed as follows. \u00a72 disambiguates \u201ctrust.\u201d \u00a73 develops the perspective-robustness account and shows how it undergirds rational epistemic trust. \u00a74 applies the account to procedural, convergent, and interactive objectivity. \u00a75 engages objections. \u00a76 offers illustrative cases; \u00a77 concludes.\n\n\u20282. What kind of trust is at issue?  \n\n2.1 Reliance vs. normative expectation  \nMost analytic work on trust (e.g., Hardin, Jones, Hawley) distinguishes mere reliance\u2014predicting that someone or something will behave in a certain way\u2014from richer forms of trust that involve normative expectations and vulnerability. One can rely on gravity without thinking gravity owes one anything; one trusts a colleague to keep a confidence partly because one would blame her if she did not. Scientific objectivity is invoked chiefly to license reliance, but the community also imposes accountability: fraudulent data do not merely disappoint expectations, they violate norms. Hence the target notion is a mixed one: epistemic-normative trust.  \n\n2.2 Two-place or three-place?  \nFine\u2019s slogan \u201cobjective = trustworthy\u201d masks the fact that trust is triadic: A (the truster) trusts B (the trustee) to do C. Who or what is B in the scientific case? Sometimes it is a person (the laboratory technician), sometimes an instrument or a process (the PCR machine), sometimes a claim (that cortisol levels rise under stress). Talk of \u201cobjective data\u201d therefore contracts the triadic relation: the data are what we trust for the epistemic task of accurate representation. But the ground of that trust often lies in a network that includes people, instruments, and procedures. Any adequate account must make room for this complexity.\n\n\u20283. Perspective-robustness: the missing link between objectivity and trust  \n\n3.1 The core idea  \nScientific inquiry is conducted by situated agents with limited cognitive resources, interests, and biases. A result is objective, on my proposal, when its epistemic status is robust under those dimensions of situatedness that the relevant scientific community currently regards as \u201cmerely perspectival.\u201d Formally:\n\nObjectivity-as-robustness: A claim p exhibits degree-d objectivity relative to a domain of legitimate perspectives P when, for a high proportion of p* \u2208 P (counterfactual variants of vantage, method, background assumption, etc.), agents occupying p* would, after proper inquiry, still accept p.\n\nThis renders objectivity a modal property: it concerns what would remain stable across counterfactual perspective-shifts. The more perspectives under which p survives, and the fewer defeating conditions needed, the higher the degree of objectivity.\n\n3.2 Why robustness warrants trust  \nTrust is a practical stance: we commit cognitive and practical resources on the assumption that what we trust will not betray us. Robustness under perspective-variation supplies the dominant epistemic rationale for that commitment. If p would be accepted by any competent inquirer whatever her particular standpoint (within the domain of legitimacy), then relying on p is a safe cognitive bet. Objectivity therefore functions as an epistemic warrant for trust, not as trust itself.\n\n3.3 Relation to existing accounts  \nThe robustness idea echoes Kantian \u201cinvariance under transformations,\u201d Reichenbach\u2019s \u201cconvergence of procedures,\u201d and more recently Wimsatt\u2019s \u201crobustness analysis.\u201d What the perspective-robustness account adds is:\n\na. Unification. It shows how standardized procedure, convergence of results, and critical interaction are all devices for inducing robustness.  \nb. Normative link. It explains why robustness, rather than some other property (say, beauty), properly grounds epistemic trust.\n\n\u20284. How the three main senses of objectivity fit the robustness template  \n\n4.1 Procedural objectivity  \nThink of 19th-century chemists weighing substances on a balance. The protocol: use standard weights, eliminate drafts, adjust for buoyancy. Why do standardized procedures matter? Because they ensure that idiosyncratic skill or bias of the operator becomes irrelevant: whoever follows the procedure will obtain (within tolerance) the same mass. In the formal schema, the domain P of legitimate perspectives includes different competent operators; robustness is achieved via method-invariance. Hence the result is trustworthy not because we have blind faith in polite behaviour, but because operator-specific features cancel out.\n\n4.2 Convergent objectivity  \nMicrometeorology supplies an example. Independent teams measuring surface fluxes of CO\u2082 with different instruments (eddy-covariance towers, chamber methods, satellite proxies) arrive at the same seasonal patterns. Here robustness is generated across instrument-types and research groups. The conjunction of independent lines of evidence drastically shrinks the set of perspectives under which the claim could fail, thereby warranting stronger trust.\n\n4.3 Interactive objectivity  \nLongino and Douglas emphasize the role of critique, uptake of diverse viewpoints, and social constraint. Suppose a pharmacology paper claims a new drug is safe. Peer reviewers, statisticians, and advocacy groups test the claim against their own background assumptions (statistical models, gender-specific side effects, etc.). If the claim withstands scrutiny, its acceptance becomes robust across the relevant critical perspectives. Again, objectivity is achieved by making the claim resilient under systematic challenge, thereby legitimizing reliance.\n\n\u20285. Objections and replies  \n\nObjection 1: Some sciences (e.g., climatology) never attain complete robustness; models remain heavily parameter-dependent. Does the account deny objectivity to them?  \nReply: Degrees matter. Objectivity is not binary. Even if ENSO projections vary across models, certain qualitative claims (global mean surface temperature increase) are robust across legitimate modelling perspectives and thus earn trust, whereas precise regional precipitation estimates do not.\n\nObjection 2: Robustness can be manufactured\u2014scientists might converge because of shared bias (e.g., methodological conservatism). How, then, can robustness be a touchstone of objectivity?  \nReply: The domain P of \u201clegitimate perspectives\u201d must be articulated reflexively. If all modelers share an unquestioned assumption, robustness across them is spurious. The perspective-robustness account is therefore iterated: objectivity claims invite ongoing efforts to broaden P. Interactive objectivity, which institutionalizes dissent, serves precisely this meta-function.\n\nObjection 3: Trust often depends on moral features\u2014honesty, good intentions\u2014not captured by robustness of claims.  \nReply: True, but note the direction of dependence. Our willingness to treat a result as perspective-robust presupposes that the social processes meant to induce robustness (replication, peer review) have not been corrupted. Thus moral trust in agents underwrites the institutional machinery that in turn yields objective products. The concepts are mutually supporting but not identical.\n\n\u20286. Examples that earn their keep  \n\n6.1 Gravitational-wave detection (LIGO)  \nLIGO\u2019s discovery of GW150914 involved (i) automated data pipelines (procedural objectivity), (ii) twin detectors 3,000 km apart plus Virgo as independent replicator (convergent objectivity), and (iii) an international collaboration with skeptics inside and outside the team (interactive objectivity). Each layer targeted a distinct category of perspective: operator error, instrument noise, and interpretive bias, respectively. The upshot was a claim whose falsity would require a conspiratorial coincidence across those categories\u2014hence high robustness, hence rational trust.  \n\n6.2 Forensic DNA labs  \nEarly \u201cwet-gel\u201d DNA typing suffered from analyst discretion. Procedural objectivity improved with fully automated capillary electrophoresis; convergent objectivity grew as different labs applied blind proficiency tests; interactive objectivity rose once defense experts were granted access to raw electropherograms. Courts increasingly admit DNA evidence precisely when these three dimensions align, demonstrating the practical import of the hierarchy.\n\n\u20287. Conclusion: toward a more precise slogan  \n\nWhat unifies the many senses of scientific objectivity is not the unanalyzed notion of trust, but the way each sense secures robustness against the perspectival contingencies of finite investigators. Objectivity earns trust by making standards of belief resilient under perspective-variation. Once this link is recognized, Fine\u2019s slogan can be recast more rigorously:\n\nObjectivity is that complex, socially situated property of scientific deliverances in virtue of which voluntary epistemic reliance on them is rationally warranted, because they remain stable across the legitimate perspectives recognized (and continually renegotiated) by the relevant community.\n\nThis formulation preserves the insight that objectivity matters because we want trustworthy science, while explaining, with greater precision, how the variegated strategies for achieving objectivity converge on a single functional goal.", "output_tokens": 2761, "reasoning_tokens": 576}

Introduction: the puzzle about \u201cobjectivity\u201d  \n\nEven among philosophers of science who agree that objectivity is more than a myth, disagreement persists about what, exactly, unifies its many advertised species. Procedural objectivity (the elimination of individual judgment by routinized protocols), convergent objectivity (cross\u2010method and cross\u2010observer agreement), interactive objectivity (the success of critical dialogue inside a research community), epistemic objectivity (judgment that is answerable to facts rather than wishes), ontic objectivity (mind\u2010independent reality), and so on, are often treated as if they shared a family resemblance without a single essence. Several writers\u2014including Arthur Fine, Heather Douglas, Lorraine Daston, and Naomi Oreskes\u2014have proposed that the common thread is trust: when we brand a result \u201cobjective,\u201d we are effectively saying: \u201cYou may trust this; it is not hostage to idiosyncrasy or bias.\u201d That claim is suggestive but thin. \u201cTrust\u201d is itself multivalent, and equating objectivity with trust risks collapsing distinct normative notions. My aim is to replace the promissory slogan with a sharper thesis:\n\nThesis.  All forms of scientific objectivity are unified by their role in underwriting second-order epistemic trust\u2014trust that is grounded not in goodwill or authority but in a publicly accessible capacity to detect and correct error.  Objectivity is thus best understood not as trust itself, nor even as a mere invitation to trust, but as a property of practices that make them trust-worthy by embedding robust, socially distributed error\u2010management mechanisms.  \n\nI develop this thesis in five steps. (i) I clarify the concept of trust and distinguish the species relevant to science. (ii) I analyze why the extant senses of objectivity cannot be reduced to trust yet nonetheless converge on securing it. (iii) I identify the unifying characteristic of objectivity as socially distributed error management. (iv) I show how the main recognized forms of objectivity instantiate that characteristic. (v) I respond to objections and draw implications for contemporary worries about reproducibility and politicization.\n\n2. Trust: what kind, directed at whom, on what basis?  \n\nPhilosophers of trust (Hardin, Holton, Jones) converge on three core elements: A trusts B to do C when (a) A is vulnerable to B\u2019s failure, (b) A expects B will do C, and (c) the expectation is grounded in some perceived competence, reliability, or goodwill. Translating to science, the object of trust is typically an epistemic deliverance (a measurement, inference, or explanation); the trustee is either the person or, more commonly, the practice that produced that deliverance; and the truster is a nonspecialist, another scientist, or society at large who wishes to rely on the result for further reasoning or action.\n\nTwo clarifications are crucial.\n\nFirst, epistemic trust is distinct from deference to authority. One can trust a climate model without understanding its code, provided one has grounds (transparently documented tests, rigorous peer review, open data) for believing errors would likely have been caught and corrected. Second, trust need not presuppose the goodwill of individual scientists. What matters is not whether researchers are saints, but whether the system of checks, incentives, and procedures is such that individual temptations to error or dishonesty are likely to be exposed. In this sense \u201ctrust\u201d shades into \u201cconfidence in institutional reliability.\u201d\n\n3. Why \u201cobjectivity = trust\u201d is too simple  \n\nWith these distinctions in place, we can see why the identity thesis (\u201cobjective\u201d just means \u201ctrusted\u201d) fails. Consider:\n\na. Diagnostic asymmetry. People often trust what is not objective (e.g., a charismatic guru\u2019s medical advice) and distrust what is (e.g., vaccines), so trust and objectivity come apart extensionally.\n\nb. Normative mismatch. Trust is a relation between agents; objectivity is a property of methods, claims, or facts. When I say \u201cthe half-life of uranium-238 is objective,\u201d I am not predicating trust but mind-independence.\n\nc. Explanatory direction. Objectivity explains why trust is warranted, not vice versa. To conflate them reverses the order of justification.\n\nHence, if trust is involved, it is because objectivity furnishes grounds for rational trust, not because it is identical to trust. The task is to specify those grounds.\n\n4. The unifying core: socially distributed error management  \n\nKarl Popper famously highlighted the role of criticism; feminist epistemologists such as Longino and Anderson stressed the need for diverse perspectives to expose idiosyncratic bias; historians like Shapin and Schaffer traced the Royal Society\u2019s experimental rhetoric to securing credibility at a distance. Across these lines runs a common idea: objectivity inheres in practices designed to make error detection and correction resilient against the limitations of any single investigator.\n\nCall this capacity SDEM: socially distributed error management. SDEM has three dimensions.\n\n(i) Accessibility: the materials needed to check a claim (data, protocols, instruments) are, in principle, available to any competent inquirer.\n\n(ii) Contestability: the procedures supply venues (peer review, replication, critique) where challenges can be voiced without penalty.\n\n(iii) Correctability: there exist standardized mechanisms (independent replication, statistical error metrics, calibration routines) for incorporating feedback and updating results.\n\nAn objective practice, on this view, is one that achieves a high SDEM score. Trust is warranted because the practice embeds an architecture that makes persistent error unlikely and exposes fraud or bias over time.\n\n5. How the recognized senses embed SDEM  \n\nProcedural objectivity (Daston & Galison). Lab manuals, automation, double-blind scoring, and standardized techniques attempt to purge personal judgment. These devices amplify SDEM\u2019s correctability by lowering the noise introduced by tacit skill and by making steps transparent and repeatable\u2014hence accessible and contestable. But because no protocol is fool-proof, procedural objectivity is only a partial realization.\n\nConvergent objectivity (Oreskes). Independent lines of evidence (palaeoclimate proxies, satellite readings, model ensembles) converge on the same quantitative estimate. Convergence demonstrates that different error sources cancel or are minimized. The epistemic work is done not by mere agreement but by agreements reached through independent pathways, thus raising SDEM\u2019s resilience against system-specific biases.\n\nInteractive objectivity (Douglas). Decisions about data inclusion, statistical thresholds, or model choices remain value-laden but can be made objective if they are exposed to critical interaction\u2014reviewers ask why this threshold, not that; model intercomparison projects publish performance metrics. Interaction supplies contestability and correctability in contexts where algorithmic routines would otherwise hide value judgments.\n\nStructural or ontological objectivity (Searle, Putnam). Claims are answerable to mind-independent structures. But in practice our warrant for that answerability is again SDEM: the fact that independent investigators probing the same system with different instruments obtain coinciding results is what tells us that we are latching onto something not idiosyncratic to any one apparatus.\n\nThus, each sub-species of objectivity can be seen as a strategy for boosting one or more dimensions of socially distributed error management. Their differences reflect historically contingent solutions to common vulnerabilities\u2014individual bias, methodological idiosyncrasy, hidden value judgments, underdetermination.\n\n6. Illustrative examples  \n\nExample 1: Double-blind randomized controlled trials (RCTs). In drug testing, neither patients nor clinicians know who receives the treatment or placebo. This erases expectation effects (procedural objectivity), mandates pre-registered protocols (accessibility), requires statistical analysis plans subject to peer review (contestability), and allows meta-analysis across independent labs (correctability). The architecture as a whole explains why regulatory agencies and physicians justifiably trust RCT conclusions even while acknowledging limitations (external validity, subgroup effects).\n\nExample 2: Climate model ensembles. Hundreds of models from distinct centers simulate past climate and project futures. Agreement across models that implement different numerical schemes and parameterizations functions as convergent objectivity. Coupled with open data repositories and intercomparison projects, this portfolio provides a transparent target for criticism, thereby securing public trust (when politics allows).\n\nExample 3: Forensic DNA databases. Matching algorithms are algorithmically opaque, but chain-of-custody protocols, error rate studies, and adversarial court proceedings supply interactive objectivity. Defense experts can challenge lab procedures; proficiency testing yields error statistics. Trust in convictions based on DNA evidence depends on this multilayered SDEM structure.\n\n7. Objections and replies  \n\nObjection 1: Replication crisis. Psychology, medicine, and economics face replicability failures despite procedural controls. Does that not falsify the SDEM thesis?  \n\nReply: The crisis is precisely a revelation that certain fields lacked adequate SDEM safeguards (e.g., undisclosed analytic flexibility, publication bias). The community\u2019s corrective actions\u2014registered reports, open data badges, larger collaborative replications\u2014are explicit moves to raise SDEM scores. Far from undermining the account, this history illustrates its diagnostic power.\n\nObjection 2: Values and politics. Critics (Harding, Kitcher) argue that entrenched social values shape what questions are asked and which results are accepted, so objectivity is an ideological veneer.  \n\nReply: SDEM is compatible with value permeation; indeed interactive objectivity demands value transparency so that stakeholders can contest assumptions. By embedding diverse perspectives, SDEM transforms political disagreement into epistemic scrutiny, improving rather than degrading objectivity.\n\nObjection 3: Excessive idealization. Actual practices fall short; data may be proprietary, junior critics may fear retaliation. The account is utopian.  \n\nReply: The point is normative: objectivity is a regulative ideal tied to SDEM. Practices warrant trust to the degree they instantiate that architecture. Recognition of gaps directs reform\u2014open access mandates, anonymized peer review, whistle-blower protections. A standard can guide improvement without presupposing perfection.\n\n8. Comparison with fine-grained alternatives  \n\nFine\u2019s \u201cNOA\u201d (Natural Ontological Attitude) asks us simply to accept successful scientific results as true without metaphysical inflation. Douglas\u2019 value-laden ideal highlights decision points. My proposal synthesizes these by locating the source of warranted acceptance in the public, corrigible structure of inquiry. It shares with Longino the emphasis on social interaction but adds a precise criterion\u2014robust error management\u2014that explains why some interactions (diverse peer review) matter more than others (mere collegial chit-chat). It also maps onto statistical notions of robustness and sensitivity analysis, forging a bridge between philosophy and applied methodology.\n\n9. Practical payoffs  \n\na. Policy advice. Agencies can appraise objectivity by auditing the SDEM features of research rather than by fetishizing \u201cpurity from values.\u201d  \n\nb. Science communication. Communicators should highlight procedural safeguards (\u201cthe trial was preregistered, data are open, independent labs replicated\u201d) to convey trustworthiness.  \n\nc. Technology assessment. Machine-learning applications in medicine or policing ought to be evaluated for SDEM properties: interpretability tools, external validation datasets, red-team hacking, post-deployment monitoring. The concept travels beyond classical science.\n\n10. Conclusion  \n\n\u201cObjectivity\u201d is not a mystical guarantee nor reducible to an attitude of trust. Its many faces reflect a single functional core: the installation of socially distributed error-management mechanisms that make epistemic deliverances worthy of trust by any competent inquirer, regardless of personal proximity or allegiance. By sharpening the notion in this way we rescue the legitimate aspirations behind procedural, convergent, and interactive objectivity and furnish both scholars and citizens with a concrete metric\u2014SDEM\u2014that can guide critique and reform. In an era when scientific authority is simultaneously indispensable and embattled, understanding objectivity as engineered trustworthiness rather than assumed virtue offers a path beyond both na\u00efve faith and cynical dismissal.", "output_tokens": 2882, "reasoning_tokens": 384}

Introduction and Thesis\n\nWhen philosophers of science speak of *objectivity*\u2014whether in its \u201cprocedural,\u201d \u201cconvergent,\u201d \u201cinteractive,\u201d or still other varieties\u2014they frequently add a promissory note: objective claims and methods are the ones we can *trust*. Arthur Fine once quipped that \u201cobjectivity is what you call the results when you want the audience to relax.\u201d Heather Douglas, from a different angle, has argued that objectivity matters chiefly because it underwrites the social trust on which modern, policy\u2010laden science depends. These remarks capture an important insight, but they also threaten to collapse a genuine epistemic property (objectivity) into a reactive attitude (trust). That conflation leaves at least three questions insufficiently addressed:\n\n(i) How exactly are the various \u201csenses\u201d of objectivity related to trust?  \n(ii) What, if anything, unifies those senses\u2014mechanical rigor, consensus, and critical interaction seem quite different.  \n(iii) Why is it rational (as opposed to merely habitual or politically expedient) to trust \u201cobjective\u201d science?\n\nI shall defend the following thesis. \n\nThesis: The multiple senses of scientific objectivity are unified by a single underlying property, *public reproducibility through impersonal accountability*. A claim, method, or dataset is objective to the extent that (a) it is open to reproduction, replication, or critical reconstruction by any competent inquirer and (b) every stage of its production is traceably accountable to agreed\u2010upon epistemic norms rather than to idiosyncratic interests. Trust is not itself objectivity; instead, objectivity *licenses* a distinctive form of *rationally grounded, non-personalistic trust*\u2014call it epistemic reliance. This dependence explains why invocations of objectivity function as invitations to public trust, yet it avoids identifying the two concepts.\n\nThe structure of the paper is as follows. \u00a72 explicates the three main senses of objectivity that dominate contemporary discussions and shows why they initially appear disunified. \u00a73 analyzes the concept of trust, distinguishing between generic social trust and the more specific epistemic reliance relevant to science. \u00a74 develops the proposed unifying account\u2014public reproducibility through impersonal accountability\u2014and shows how it subsumes procedural, convergent, and interactive objectivity. \u00a75 addresses three major objections. \u00a76 illustrates the account with two concrete cases: high-precision mass measurement and climate model inter-comparison. \u00a77 concludes by clarifying what is gained by disentangling objectivity from trust while elucidating their relation.\n\n2. The Many Faces of Objectivity\n\n2.1 Procedural Objectivity  \nOriginating in nineteenth-century lab practice (\u201clet the apparatus do the talking\u201d), procedural objectivity demands that the route from phenomenon to datum be as automatic, mechanized, and person-independent as possible. Photography supplants hand\u2010drawing; double-blinding removes experimenter bias; pre-registration locks analytic choices. Here, objectivity is a property of *methods*.\n\n2.2 Convergent Objectivity  \nOther writers, drawing on the \u201cmiracle\u201d of widespread agreement among diverse investigators, propose that objectivity inheres in the *robustness of results*: independent labs, via different techniques, arrive at the same numerical constant; particle energies converge across detectors; climate trajectories align across models. Objectivity is attributed to the *products* of inquiry when convergence is achieved.\n\n2.3 Interactive Objectivity  \nA third strand, emphasized by Longino and later Douglas, locates objectivity in the *social* process of criticism. Science is objective when claims survive vigorous interrogation from investigators with varied background assumptions. Here transparency, norm-governed debate, and responsiveness to criticism are central. Objectivity is essentially *dialogical*.\n\nAt first glance, these three notions seem to point in different directions: mechanical technique, empirical convergence, social critique.\n\n3. What Is Trust, and Which Kind Matters?\n\nBefore relating objectivity to trust, we must specify the type of trust at stake.\n\n3.1 Generic Trust vs. Epistemic Reliance  \n\u201cTrust,\u201d in ordinary language, is a three-place relation: A trusts B with respect to \u03c6. It involves an expectation of competence and goodwill, plus a vulnerability to betrayal. Scientists routinely trust suppliers to ship uncontaminated reagents, students to record data honestly, and co-authors to keep deadlines. These are examples of *personal* or *social\u2010relational* trust.\n\nYet when we say, \u201cThe half-life of cobalt-60 is objectively 5.27 years; you can trust that number,\u201d the object of trust is not a *person* but a *claim or method*. Moreover, it is not something we must personalize; anyone, regardless of social intimacy, is entitled to rely on that datum. Let us call this special attitude *epistemic reliance*. It is still trust-like (we bet action on its correctness), but it is:\n\n(a) Non\u2010personalistic: the reliance is not on particular agents\u2019 goodwill.  \n(b) Public: entitlement is symmetric among inquirers.  \n(c) Normatively warranted: grounded in reasons rather than in habit or authority alone.\n\n3.2 The Rationality Condition  \nFor such reliance to be rational, the target of reliance must bear certain properties (reliability, repeatability, impartiality). Objectivity, whatever else it is, must be a cluster of those properties. Thus trust is *derivative*; objectivity is the *ground*.\n\n4. Public Reproducibility through Impersonal Accountability\n\nThe guiding idea is deceptively simple: an objective result is one that is *stably available to any competent inquirer, irrespective of their individual perspectives, because the processes that generate and certify it are both reproducible and accountable*. Let me unpack the two components.\n\n4.1 Public Reproducibility  \nA claim is publicly reproducible when the route from raw phenomenon to final statement can, in principle and with reasonable resources, be retraced by others. Reproducibility can be literal (redo the experiment and get the same result) or reconstructive (follow the data pipeline and verify each transformation). The key is *accessibility of method*.\n\n4.2 Impersonal Accountability  \nReproducing a procedure is useless without assurance that each step adhered to shared epistemic norms (instrument calibration, statistical integrity, disclosure of uncertainty, conflict-of-interest transparency). Traceability\u2014leaving an audit trail\u2014makes it feasible for third parties to assign responsibility for deviations and to demand corrections. The process is \u201cimpersonal\u201d because the norms are not tailored to any one actor; they are mutually recognized constraints.\n\n4.3 Subsuming the Three Senses\n\na. Procedural Objectivity: Mechanization is one path to impersonal accountability; machines leave less room for idiosyncratic discretion and create an audit trail (instrument logs, raw files). Thus procedural techniques aim to maximize component (b) given inevitable limits on (a).\n\nb. Convergent Objectivity: Independent convergence is simply the empirical manifestation that public reproducibility has been achieved across diverse routes. If multiple, epistemically independent chains all yield the same number, the claim has passed both reproducibility (many can do it) and accountability (each chain is open to check).\n\nc. Interactive Objectivity: Social criticism is the mechanism that *enforces* accountability. Without a community empowered to question choices, audit trails are moot. Participatory critique ensures that the traceable steps are actually inspected and that hidden subjective influences are exposed.\n\nThus, the three varieties mark different *emphases* or *heuristics* for securing the same underlying property.\n\n4.4 Why This Unification Matters  \nFirst, it clarifies why the rhetoric of objectivity invites trust: if a result is reproducible in this stringent, accountable sense, then any agent who meets the competence threshold can *verify* it rather than merely *believe* it. Second, it sidesteps sterile debates\u2014e.g., whether mechanical procedures are outdated or whether consensus suffices\u2014by showing that each strategy captures only part of the picture.\n\n5. Addressing Objections\n\nObjection 1: \u201cReproducibility Is Neither Necessary nor Sufficient.\u201d  \nComplex simulations (e.g., global climate models) are notoriously difficult to reproduce in the strict sense; yet we still regard their projections as objective. Response: The account allows for *reconstructive* reproducibility\u2014access to code, parameters, and validation suites so that independent teams can *audit* sensitivity and benchmark outputs. Perfect repetition is not required; what matters is that potential discrepancies have traceable sources.\n\nObjection 2: \u201cAccountability Relies on Social Trust in Institutions; You Have Moved the Bump.\u201d  \nIndeed, labs, journals, and funding agencies must enforce norms. Does this not reintroduce personal trust? Partly, yes; but epistemic reliance in the sense defined remains distinct. We rely on the *system* because we have evidence of its norm-enforcing capacities\u2014error corrections, retractions, replication studies. The trust is *conditional* on ongoing accountability; when that erodes (e.g., pharmaceutical conflicts), reliance is withdrawn.\n\nObjection 3: \u201cStandpoint Epistemology Shows that Total Impersonality Is Impossible.\u201d  \nThe account does not deny the influence of perspective; instead, it embeds diversity into the interactive component. Because pathways are public and accountable, *differently situated* observers can locate latent biases and insist on adjustments. Impersonal accountability is therefore achieved *through* pluralistic scrutiny, not by pretending to a \u201cview from nowhere.\u201d\n\n6. Illustrative Cases\n\n6.1 The Kibble Balance and Avogadro Project  \nRedefining the kilogram in terms of Planck\u2019s constant required independent Kibble balances to converge on a value within parts-per-billion. Each lab\u2019s procedure was exhaustively documented (coil windings, vacuum pressures, gravitational gradients). Teams published calibration data and uncertainty budgets, enabling outside physicists to reconstruct error propagation. The final CODATA value had procedural transparency, replicative convergence, and years of critical workshops. The public adoption of the new SI definition exemplifies rational epistemic reliance: industry, medicine, and basic science now \u201ctrust\u201d kilogram realizations worldwide, not because they trust the Paris BIPM officials personally, but because the result is reproducible-and-accountable in the specified sense.\n\n6.2 Climate Model Inter-Comparison (CMIP)  \nClimate projections influence trillions in economic planning, so the stakes for trustworthiness are high. CMIP\u2019s protocol requires each modeling center to submit not only outputs but also code descriptions, forcing functions, and ensemble configurations. Independent statisticians perform detection\u2010and\u2010attribution tests across models, identifying compensating errors. While no single simulation is fully reproducible (they depend on HPC architectures), the multi-model ensemble achieves *reconstructive reproducibility*: diverse implementations subject to uniform diagnostics. The rigorous archive, plus transparent debate in IPCC assessment rounds, instantiate impersonal accountability. Public reproducibility through these mechanisms is the epistemic foundation for policy trust in the resulting temperature ranges.\n\n7. Conclusion\n\nFine and Douglas are right that objectivity and public trust in science are intimately linked, but the relationship is asymmetrical. Objectivity is not reducible to trust; rather, it is a *joint property of methods, results, and communal practices*\u2014public reproducibility through impersonal accountability\u2014that (and only that) *warrants* a specific, non-personalistic form of epistemic trust. Procedural, convergent, and interactive senses each illuminate a facet of this property, and together they provide complementary paths to its realization.\n\nClarifying this relationship has several payoffs. Philosophically, it unifies disparate strands of discussion under a single conceptual umbrella. Practically, it helps scientific institutions prioritize investments: enhancing data archiving, open methodology, and participatory critique all serve the same goal. Politically, it offers the public a clearer criterion for distinguishing trustworthy science from mere authority claims: demand reproducibility plus accountability.\n\nDisentangled yet interdependent, objectivity and trust emerge not as fuzzy honorifics but as components in a rational architecture of inquiry\u2014an architecture open to anyone willing to inspect, reproduce, and hold accountable.", "output_tokens": 2952, "reasoning_tokens": 384}

Introduction and Thesis\n\nWhen we praise a measurement, a model, or an entire research programme as \u201cobjective,\u201d we often mean that it can be relied upon\u2014that, in Arthur Fine\u2019s phrase, it is \u201cworthy of our trust.\u201d  Yet \u201ctrust\u201d is too undifferentiated to explain why a double-blind clinical trial, the historical convergence of rival spectroscopic techniques on the same atomic constants, and the organised antagonism of peer review all earn the same honorific.  My claim is that the common core of scientific objectivity is not trust per se but a distinctive form of warranted reliance grounded in impersonally accessible, symmetry-preserving and systematically error-correcting constraints.  Call this core feature public warrant.  Procedural, convergent, and interactive objectivity are best understood as three families of strategies for securing public warrant: they remove idiosyncratic influences (symmetry), expose results to independent checks (accessibility) and incorporate built-in mechanisms for detecting and correcting error (systematic revision).  Trust is the downstream social attitude licensed by public warrant, not its constitutive essence.  \n\nI defend this thesis in six steps.  Section 2 disentangles three kinds of trust and shows why none can unify the senses of objectivity.  Section 3 develops the notion of public warrant and explains how it differs analytically from trust.  Sections 4\u20136 examine in turn procedural, convergent and interactive objectivity, showing how each implements public warrant in a distinctive way.  Section 7 replies to two objections: that my account collapses objectivity into mere consensus, and that it ignores the value-laden character of many research contexts.  Section 8 draws out implications for the sociology of expertise and for science communication.\n\n2. Why \u201ctrust\u201d Is Too Blunt an Instrument\n\nPhilosophers since Baier have distinguished three main kinds of trust:\n\n(a) Personal trust: A trusts B with regard to \u03c6 because A believes B is benevolent or at least non-malevolent toward A\u2019s interests.\n\n(b) Reliance: A relies on B\u2019s doing \u03c6 while recognising that B may have no special concern for A.\n\n(c) Systemic trust: A trusts a complex practice or institution (e.g. the banking system or the journal refereeing system) because of perceived structural safeguards.\n\nAll three notions appear in the rhetoric surrounding objectivity, but they come apart in ways that make any simple identification of objectivity with trust misleading.\n\nExample 1 (personal): Astronomers may personally trust a senior colleague\u2019s unpublished redshift measurements owing to long acquaintance.  Yet if those data were produced without calibration records, journals refuse to treat them as objective.  Personal trust alone is insufficient.\n\nExample 2 (mere reliance): A hospital administrator may rely on rapid antigen tests during a shortage, not because the tests are objective but because they are the only feasible option.  Reliance can occur without the epistemic imprimatur we call objectivity.\n\nExample 3 (systemic): The same administrator may trust the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s approval process.  This is closer to the mark, but even here trust is an attitude we adopt toward an antecedently warranted system; it does not itself confer warrant.\n\nBecause \u201ctrust\u201d slides across these senses, the suggestion that objectivity is \u201cwhat we may trust\u201d threatens to collapse into a tautology: we trust what is trustworthy.  To avoid circularity we need a prior account of what makes a result trustworthy.  That is where public warrant enters.\n\n3. From Trust to Public Warrant\n\nCall a claim \u201cpublicly warranted\u201d when any competent inquirer, irrespective of local loyalties or social position, can in principle:\n\n(i) inspect the evidential grounding of the claim via shared standards and instrumentation (accessibility);\n\n(ii) see that influences tied to particular persons, places or perspectives have been neutralised or symmetrically balanced (impersonality);\n\n(iii) trace a path along which adverse evidence or alternative explanations would trigger correction, withdrawal or refinement (error-responsiveness).\n\nPublic warrant is therefore a property of an epistemic product or practice, whereas trust is a relation between persons (or collectives) and that product or practice.  The relationship is asymmetric: public warrant is designed to justify trust; trust is rational (though not compelled) in light of public warrant.\n\n4. Procedural Objectivity as Mechanical Impersonality\n\nDaston and Galison\u2019s \u201cmechanical objectivity\u201d paradigmatically exemplifies procedural objectivity: follow the protocol, and the observer\u2019s idiosyncrasies drop out.  Early photographic atlases of nebulae were celebrated precisely because they displaced the subjective hand of the draughtsman.\n\nHow does this instantiate public warrant?\n\nAccessibility: The protocol is explicit and can be replicated elsewhere.\n\nImpersonality: By rigidly constraining judgment\u2014through double blinding, randomisation, predetermined statistical thresholds\u2014the procedure aims to erase personal discretion.\n\nError-responsiveness: Deviations from protocol leave an audit trail; replication can expose them.\n\nHence procedural objectivity secures public warrant by front-loading impersonality into algorithmic or mechanical steps.  But this strategy is limited: no finite protocol can anticipate every error mode.  Here convergent and interactive objectivity pick up the slack.\n\n5. Convergent Objectivity as Robustness Through Independence\n\nConvergent objectivity, emphasised by W.E. Johnson and later by Fine, appeals to a pattern: independent lines of evidence converge on the same parameter or phenomenon.  Think of Avogadro\u2019s number derived from gas laws, electrochemistry and Brownian motion; or the age of the Earth triangulated by radiometric dating, astrophysical models and ice-core stratigraphy.\n\nPublic warrant is secured because:\n\nAccessibility: Multiple datasets, methods and theories are openly available for scrutiny.\n\nImpersonality: The independence of evidential pathways reduces the probability that the same idiosyncratic bias would infect all.\n\nError-responsiveness: Divergence among lines immediately flags problems, enforcing self-correction.\n\nOn a Bayesian reading, convergence increases posterior confidence by multiplying conditional independences; on a frequentist reading, it enhances robustness.  Either way, convergent objectivity operationalises public warrant not by eliminating discretionary judgment (as procedural objectivity tries to) but by making any residual judgment cancel out through independence.\n\n6. Interactive Objectivity as Regulated Contestation\n\nHelen Longino and Heather Douglas draw attention to the social dimension: objectivity arises when hypotheses are subjected to organised, open criticism across a diversity of perspectives\u2014peer review, adversarial collaboration, meta-analysis.  Biases are exposed not by suppressing judgment but by placing judgments in view of differently located others.\n\nPublic warrant here is realised thus:\n\nAccessibility: Critiques, data and methods circulate through publications, conferences, repositories.\n\nImpersonality: No single perspective enjoys final authority; recognition of plurality is built in.\n\nError-responsiveness: Norms of response\u2014citation, replication, rebuttal\u2014make it costly to ignore disconfirming arguments.\n\nWhere procedural objectivity minimises judgment and convergent objectivity spreads bets across independent channels, interactive objectivity harnesses contestation itself as an engine of reliability.\n\n7. Two Objections Answered\n\nObjection 1: \u201cYou have reduced objectivity to public consensus or popularity.\u201d  \n\nReply: Public warrant differs from consensus in two ways.  First, consensus can arise through imitation or social pressure, whereas public warrant requires symmetry-preserving mechanisms that remain available even to dissenters.  Second, public warrant is forward-looking: it encodes how the community would likely react were disconfirming evidence to emerge.  A temporary consensus lacking such sensitivity (e.g. early 20th-century eugenics) is not objectively warranted.\n\nObjection 2: \u201cValue-laden science undermines the impersonality condition; policy-relevant modelling inevitably embeds social values.\u201d  \n\nReply: Values enter in two distinct roles\u2014directive (framing research questions) and evidential (bearing on what counts as adequate confirmation).  Public warrant does not exclude values; it requires that their operative role be transparent and contestable.  Climate-economy integrated assessment models, for instance, become more objective when their discount rates, damage functions and equity weights are explicitly documented and exposed to critique.  The same triad\u2014accessibility, impersonality via symmetry of standpoint, and error-responsiveness\u2014shows how even value-rich reasoning can achieve objectivity.\n\n8. Implications\n\n(1) Sociology of expertise: Public warrant clarifies why laypersons may rationally distrust expert consensus when accessibility or error-responsiveness is perceived as weak, even if procedural safeguards exist.  Increasing transparency in data and code directly fortifies objectivity.\n\n(2) Science communication: Framing scientific claims as \u201ctrust us, we\u2019re the experts\u201d neglects the architectural grounds of warranted trust.  Communicating the error-correcting paths (replication efforts, audit trails, rival models) can bolster public confidence more effectively than appeals to credentialism.\n\n(3) Interdisciplinary research: Conflicts between quantitative and qualitative methods often revolve around which dimensions of public warrant are salient.  Quantitative traditions lean on procedural and convergent strategies; qualitative traditions rely heavier on interactive strategies (e.g. participant validation).  Recognising these as complementary rather than competing forms of warrant can defuse methodological turf wars.\n\n9. Conclusion\n\nScientific objectivity is unified not by the attitude of trust but by the structural property of public warrant: impersonally accessible, symmetry-respecting and self-correcting epistemic scaffolding.  Trust is an attitudinal response licensed\u2014though never guaranteed\u2014by that scaffolding.  Procedural, convergent and interactive objectivity operationalise public warrant through distinct but mutually reinforcing strategies: algorithmic discipline, evidential triangulation and regulated contestation.  Seeing the relationship in this order avoids the circularity of defining objectivity by trust while explaining why practices that earn the title \u201cobjective\u201d are precisely those on which informed agents may rationally, though always revisably, place their trust.", "output_tokens": 2457, "reasoning_tokens": 384}

Suppose a physician\u2019s best evidence says that a novel drug has a 60 % chance of curing her patient, yet the slightest possibility of a fatal side\u2010effect will devastate the family.  Her epistemic reasons (E-reasons) favor believing the drug is more likely helpful than harmful; her practical reasons (P-reasons) favor withholding that belief so she will order further tests.  The general puzzle is this:\n\n1. E-reasons track truth\u2010conduciveness.  \n2. P-reasons track value\u2014moral, prudential, or otherwise.  \n3. Truth and value appear incommensurable.  \n4.

Must one sort of reason always trump the other?  Must we restrict \u201cought to believe\u201d to a purely epistemic reading, relegating practical considerations to some other attitude (acceptance, assumption)?  Or can the two be compared after all?\n\nTHESIS.  The apparent incommensurability dissolves once we see that \u201cought to believe\u201d is systematically ambiguous.  There is (i) a domain-specific epistemic ought, governed solely by E-reasons, and (ii) an all-things-considered ought, governed by a weighted aggregation of both E- and P-reasons.  Aggregation is possible because E-reasons and P-reasons share a higher-order currency: expected value with respect to the agent\u2019s doxastic aim.  For ordinary belief the constitutive aim is holding true propositions, but that aim can be lexically subordinated or amplified by practical stakes.  The resulting two-tier model explains interaction without treating truth and value as directly comparable magnitudes.  It also predicts when practical stakes legitimately \u201cencroach\u201d on epistemic justification and when they do not.\n\nI proceed in five steps:\n\n1. Clarify the types of reason and the varieties of \u201cought.\u201d  \n2. Diagnose the illusion of incommensurability.  \n3. Present the two-tier aggregation model.  \n4. Defend the model against four major objections.  \n5. Show how the model illuminates disputed cases such as Pascal\u2019s Wager, high-stakes error avoidance, and friendship\u2010based doxastic partiality.\n\n1. TWO KINDS OF REASON, TWO OUGHTS\n\nCall a consideration a reason for S to believe p insofar as it counts in favor of S\u2019s adopting the doxastic state Bel(p).  Reasons come in families.  Two salient ones:\n\nE-reasons: evidence of p\u2019s truth (test results, testimony, perception).  \nP-reasons: expected practical consequences of believing p (utility, moral duty, personal welfare).\n\nThe same item can count as both: learning that a bridge is safe both evidentially supports the proposition and practically facilitates crossing.  Nevertheless, the normative standards differ.  Epistemic rationality aims at accuracy; practical rationality aims at valuable outcomes.  That bifurcation motivates separate \u201coughts\u201d:\n\nEpistemic Ought (O_e): S epistemically ought to believe p iff believing p best promotes accuracy given S\u2019s evidence.  \n\nPractical Ought (O_p): S practically ought to believe p iff believing p best promotes her relevant values.  \n\nAll-Things-Considered Ought (O_a): the final verdict that action\u2010guides the agent.\n\nA great deal of confusion arises from sliding between O_e and O_a.  Critics who insist practical factors are \u201cirrelevant to belief\u201d implicitly restrict \u201cought\u201d to O_e.  But ordinary discourse treats \u201cYou really shouldn\u2019t believe that\u2014if you\u2019re wrong it will ruin you\u201d as coherent.  So philosophy needs an account of O_a that adjudicates across domains.\n\n2. THE ILLUSION OF INCOMMENSURABILITY\n\nWhy think E- and P-reasons cannot be weighed together?  Two arguments dominate.\n\nThe Different-Kind Argument\n(A1) E-reasons are about truth; P-reasons are about value.  \n(A2) Truth and value lack a common scale.  \nTherefore E- and P-reasons are incommensurable.\n\nThe Constitutive Aim Argument\n(B1) The constitutive aim of belief is truth.  \n(B2) Whatever is constitutive is lexically overriding.  \nTherefore only truth\u2010conducive reasons can determine belief.\n\nBoth lines overstate.  Regarding (A1)\u2013(A2), even if their direct objects differ, nothing prevents a higher-order metric from mediating them.  Decision theory routinely treats utilities (values) and probabilities (truth estimates) jointly via expected utility.  Regarding (B1)\u2013(B2), the constitutive aim sets the default norm but does not automatically trump every other consideration.  That Bel aims at Truth still leaves room for comparative assessment: how much accuracy must be sacrificed to avoid catastrophic loss?  The possibility of justified acceptance without belief in high-stakes science (defensive medicine) testifies that belief\u2019s aim is defeasible in extreme circumstances.\n\n3. THE TWO-TIER AGGREGATION MODEL\n\n3.1  A Shared Currency: Expected Doxastic Value\n\nLet U be the utility function representing the agent\u2019s stakes.  Let Pr(p | e) be her credence in p given evidence e.  The value of adopting Bel(p) is a function of two variables:\n\nDV(Bel(p)) = Pr(p|e) \u00b7 U(TrueBelief) + (1 \u2212 Pr(p|e)) \u00b7 U(FalseBelief).\n\nTruth enters via Pr; practical value enters via U.  The function yields an expected doxastic value (DV) that allows comparison across alternatives: believe, withhold, or disbelieve.\n\nThe crucial point: DV is not crassly \u201ctrading truth for dollars.\u201d  Rather, it operationalises the idea that the rational agent wants accurate beliefs but is not indifferent to the costs of error.  The weights implicit in U encode her practical priorities.  Importantly, nothing in this formalism requires cardinalizing truth or value per se; it suffices that the agent have ordinal preferences over belief states conditional on outcomes\u2014a mild assumption shared by virtually all decision-theoretic models of action.\n\n3.2  Lexical Default with Override\n\nTier-1: Epistemic Justification.  The agent first assesses whether Pr(p|e) crosses an evidential threshold T appropriate to the context (say, 0.9 for \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d).  If it does not, Bel(p) is epistemically impermissible, settling the matter.  Tier-1 thus gives E-reasons lexical priority up to a point.\n\nTier-2: Practical Stakes.  When Pr(p|e) hovers near enough to T that the error utilities dominate the accuracy margin, P-reasons can justify deviating from the epistemic default.  Formally, if |Pr(p|e) \u2212 T| < \u03b4 and |U(FalseBelief) \u2212 U(TrueBelief)| is large, then maximizing DV may require believing, disbelieving, or withholding contrary to Tier-1.  \u03b4 marks a \u201czone of parity\u201d where E-reasons alone underdetermine belief.\n\nThe result is domain interaction without brute commensuration.  Epistemic reasons move first and set boundaries; practical reasons speak only when the epistemic margin is small enough that ignoring stakes would be gratuitous.  The model thus vindicates our ordinary sense that in low-stakes contexts (\u201cWhich exit do I take?\u201d) only evidence matters, whereas in high-stakes contexts (\u201cIs the gun loaded?\u201d) caution legitimately raises the bar.\n\n3.3  The All-Things-Considered Ought\n\nS ought_a to believe p iff Bel(p) maximizes DV subject to the Tier-1 constraint.  Notice: sometimes O_e = O_a, sometimes not.  Divergence is not paradoxical; it mirrors morality\u2019s own structure, where (say) legality and morality can conflict, requiring an all-things-considered verdict.\n\n4. DEFENDING THE MODEL\n\nOBJECTION 1: No Doxastic Voluntarism, No Aggregation\n\nBeliefs are not actions; we cannot choose them on DV grounds.\n\nReply.  The model is normative, not psychological.  It specifies the standards belief should meet, not the mechanisms by which we adopt it.  Even if belief is involuntary in the moment, reflection on stakes can shift one\u2019s evidence threshold or motivate evidence-gathering measures that indirectly determine belief.  Physicians ordering new tests adjust credences precisely because practical risks loom large.\n\nOBJECTION 2: The Aim of Belief is Constitutive and Overriding\n\nIf truth constitutes belief, permitting practical override cancels belief\u2019s identity.\n\nReply.  The constitutive claim is usually cashed out teleologically: belief aims at truth.  But aims admit satisficing and exceptions.  Aiming at health does not forbid occasional indulgence in dessert.  What would cancel belief\u2019s identity is indifference to truth.  Our model never counsels that; it weighs tiny truth-gains against catastrophic practical loss when the evidence margin is slim.  Moreover, many epistemologists already allow pragmatic encroachment on knowledge via stakes-sensitive standards (Stanley, Hawthorne).  The two-tier model simply systematizes that insight.\n\nOBJECTION 3: Commensurability by DV is Ad Hoc\n\nWhy privilege expected value over other aggregation schemes?  Utility functions are controversial.\n\nReply.  Any rational reconciliation needs some structure capturing (a) degrees of evidential support and (b) comparative stakes.  Expected\u2010value frameworks are the minimal, most general tool we possess that does both while preserving dominance and sure-thing principles.  Alternative pluralist or lexically ordered schemes secretly import equivalent trade-offs.  Furthermore, DV operates over belief states, not monetary payoffs, sidestepping standard objections to interpersonal or cardinal utility.\n\nOBJECTION 4: The Model Blurs Belief and Acceptance\n\nPerhaps practicality should influence acceptance (for policy) but not belief proper.\n\nReply.  Distinguishing belief from acceptance is valuable, but the physician case shows practical override can penetrate genuine belief.  Facing massive malpractice liability, doctors often come to believe \u201cI don\u2019t know whether the drug is safe\u201d even while evidence favours safety, because the epistemic threshold is pragmatically raised.  Our model explains how such threshold modulation yields honest belief change, not mere pretense.\n\n5. CASE STUDIES\n\n5.1  Pascal\u2019s Wager\n\nE-reasons for God\u2019s existence are\u2014let us grant\u2014weak.  P-reasons (eternal bliss or damnation) are astronomically weighty.  Does DV insist we believe?  Tier-1 blocks the move: if Pr(God) is well below the evidential threshold, belief is epistemically impermissible.  Practical stakes cannot force belief when evidence is severely deficient.  The Wager thus fails not because stakes are irrelevant but because Tier-1 erects a lexical barrier.\n\n5.2  High-Stakes Error Avoidance\n\nSuppose an engineer\u2019s instruments indicate a bridge can take the load with 99 % probability.  Ordinarily that surpasses any threshold.  Yet human lives are at stake.  Error utility is enormous, DV may favour double-checking.  Tier-1 is satisfied, but the zone of parity \u03b4 is small; here practical override occurs.  The engineer ought_a to withhold belief until further tests confirm.\n\n5.3  Doxastic Partiality to Friends\n\nYou have evidence that your friend plagiarized.  Loyalty (a P-reason) pulls in the opposite direction.  If the evidence is middling (in the \u03b4 zone), you may suspend judgment pending private inquiry without epistemic blame.  Tier-2 legitimates charity toward friends when it does not require ignoring overwhelming evidence.\n\n6. IMPLICATIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS\n\na. Normative Pluralism.  The account vindicates a moderate pluralism: there are distinct epistemic and practical norms, but they are not sealed silos.  \n\nb. Pragmatic Encroachment as Threshold Shift.  Stakes affect knowledge or justified belief not by altering evidence but by adjusting the permissible threshold T.  This yields a precise encroachment mechanism.  \n\nc. Epistemic Risk Management.  The model supplies a framework for fields like medicine, finance, and engineering, where belief management under risk is routine.  \n\nd. Research Program.  Open questions include calibrating \u03b4 across contexts, integrating collective epistemic agents, and exploring how moral vs prudential utilities interact.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe claim that E-reasons and P-reasons are incommensurable rests on a false dilemma: either truth outranks value absolutely or any trade-off betrays the nature of belief.  A two-tier model shows a middle path.  Epistemic norms set the default and draw hard constraints; practical stakes legitimately intervene within a evidential neighborhood of doubt.  Aggregation occurs through expected doxastic value, a higher-order metric combining credence and utility without reducing one to the other.  Thus, what one all-things-considered ought to believe emerges from principled interaction, not brute compromise.  The result reconciles our intuitions about high-stakes caution and low-stakes credulity, rescues ordinary talk of \u201cshould believe\u201d from paradox, and opens fresh avenues for interdisciplinary work on rational belief management.", "output_tokens": 3322, "reasoning_tokens": 448}

I can be staring at excellent statistical evidence that my child\u2019s late-night call almost certainly signals mere homesickness at camp (epistemic reason to be calm) while also knowing that if I do not rush to pick her up she will experience acute panic with lasting psychological harm (practical reason to believe she needs me). Both reasons bear, somehow, on what I ought to believe, yet they seem to speak different languages\u2014truth versus value. How, if at all, can they interact?  \n\nI defend a two-level, lexical-priority model. Very roughly: \n\n1. Epistemic reasons determine a threshold of permissibility: one must not believe p unless the epistemic case for p is at least good enough.  \n\n2. Within the set of beliefs that clear that threshold\u2014often there will be several, because evidence underdetermines belief\u2014practical reasons legitimately select among them, providing tie-breakers or guidance.  \n\nCrucially, this is not an ad hoc compromise but flows from a background picture of doxastic agency. Our fundamental aim in belief formation is to get at the truth; but we also inevitably form beliefs while embedded in practical projects. The upshot is a division of labor, governed by a lexical ordering: epistemic adequacy first, pragmatic choice second.  \n\nThe rest of the essay proceeds as follows. Section I sharpens the puzzle. Section II motivates the two-level model by drawing a distinction between *epistemic authorization* and *doxastic discretion*. Section III shows how the model handles four vexing cases. Section IV engages three leading objections. Section V compares alternative proposals and explains why lexical priority is superior. Section VI concludes with implications for permissivism, encroachment, and the ethics of belief.  \n\nI. The Puzzle Revisited  \nCall a reason epistemic when its favoring strength tracks the likelihood that p is true; call a reason practical when its favoring strength tracks the value of believing p (or disbelieving, or suspending). Because \u201cbeing true\u201d and \u201cbeing valuable to believe\u201d are on the face of it distinct properties, it is natural to worry that the favoring relations they ground are incomparable: we seem to be asked to weigh electric charge against musical pitch.  \n\nA standard way to dramatize incommensurability is *James\u2019s shipwreck case*: an exhausted sailor adrift on debris must decide whether to believe a rescuing ship is coming. Evidence is paltry; hope sustains life. Should she believe? If epistemic reasons alone govern, clearly no. If practical reasons dominate (hope is literally life-saving), clearly yes. But if both matter, what adjudicates? Without a currency that measures both truth and value, the decision rule appears under-determined.  \n\nSome philosophers draw a hard line: \u201cThe aim of belief is truth, full stop; practical reasons are irrelevant.\u201d Others embrace pragmatic encroachment: \u201cPractical stakes modulate epistemic justification itself.\u201d Both moves avoid the weighing problem by collapsing one domain into the other. I argue they give us the wrong phenomenology. We do feel epistemically *unmoved* by practical stakes (\u201cYes, I know the odds are still low, but\u2026\u201d) yet also feel their rational pull. Something more discriminating is needed.  \n\nII. Epistemic Authorization vs. Doxastic Discretion  \nStart from a non-ideal observation: at any time, an agent\u2019s total evidence typically underdetermines a unique doxastic attitude. Even granting evidentialism, one may permissibly believe, disbelieve, or suspend whenever the evidence is balanced or ambiguous. This phenomenon\u2014epistemic *permissivism*\u2014creates room for choice. The crucial question is: who or what chooses?  \n\nHere is my proposal.  \n\nStage 1. Epistemic Authorization  \nThere is a threshold *T* such that believing p without evidence that passes T is impermissible *period*. Below T, no amount of practical benefit can license belief, because such belief would exchange the constitutive aim of believing\u2014tracking truth\u2014for foreign ends. James himself calls this *Will to Believe* permissible only where evidence is \u201cinsufficient but not wholly lacking\u201d; he tacitly assumes a threshold.  \n\nStage 2. Doxastic Discretion  \nAbove T, the agent confronts a *selection space* S of attitudes each of which is \u201cepistemically OK\u201d (they all satisfy the truth-aim minimally). Within S, practical reasons may legitimately tip the scales. What one epistemically **may** believe, one then practically **should** believe if doing so promotes rational ends (well-being, moral duty, etc.) better than its competitors.  \n\nLexical priority follows: epistemic defeat is absolute; practical considerations enter only after epistemic permission is secured. This structure parallels Rawls\u2019s priority of liberty over utility: certain constraints are non-negotiable, but within them, aggregation is permissible.  \n\nIII. Testing the Model  \n\n1. The Life-Sustaining Hope (Shipwreck)  \nEvidence that rescue is coming is, say, 30 %. Whether that crosses T depends on how stringent we set it. Suppose not. Then believing rescue is coming is epistemically off-limits. The sailor must seek alternative practical strategies (perhaps cultivating *imagination* rather than outright belief). The model explains why epistemic integrity stands firm in the face of overwhelming stakes\u2014yet leaves space for pragmatic acts short of belief.  \n\n2. Religious Faith in Dire Circumstances  \nIn a war prison, trusting that a comrade will return (despite middling evidence) sustains morale. Suppose evidence is ambiguous: 50 % dispersed reports, no disconfirming signals. If that meets T, then both belief and suspension are epistemically available. Practical reason\u2014bolstering morale\u2014makes belief rationally required. Notice the model yields a positive answer in a way that respects, rather than recasts, epistemic standards.  \n\n3. Placebo Belief by a Physician  \nCan a doctor *believe* an inert pill is effective to harness placebo effects? Evidence says otherwise; T is nowhere near met. Result: epistemically forbidden. The doctor may nonetheless *intend* the patient to believe, or strategically *say* she believes, but genuine belief is ruled out\u2014a verdict intuitive to most.  \n\n4. High-Stakes Error Avoidance  \nAn engineer checking a bridge has 99 % evidence of safety. Should she believe \u201cThe bridge will not collapse\u201d? If the cost of error is catastrophic, practical reason counsels caution. But the belief\u2019s negation\u2014\u201cIt might collapse\u201d\u2014also clears T (the evidence hardly precludes remote failure). Permissivism supplies two epistemically available attitudes: confidence in safety, or a guarded agnosticism. Practical reason selects the latter. We thereby explain how high practical stakes *appropriately* influence belief without undermining the value of evidence.  \n\nIV. Objections and Replies  \n\nObjection 1: Threshold Arbitrariness.  \nWhere is T set? Any fixed line risks being ad hoc, and a variable line risks collapsing into pragmatic encroachment.  \n\nReply: T is fixed by the constitutive aim of belief plus general features of our cognitive ecology. As mandated by truth-aim, T must be high enough to make true belief statistically likely; cognitive limitations dictate it cannot be so high that virtually no empirical belief ever qualifies. This leaves a moderate but not arbitrary placement, roughly aligning with what we call \u201cjustified belief.\u201d Crucially, practical stakes never *move* T; they only operate after T is crossed, escaping encroachment.  \n\nObjection 2: Evidential Purism.  \nSome claim any appeal to practical reasons in belief is a category mistake: belief aims at truth, so only epistemic reasons weigh.  \n\nReply: The purist is right about *ground-level* aim but wrong about second-order governance. Consider that epistemic justification is often permissive; ties must be broken somehow. If purism forbids practical input, then arbitrary factors (temperament, salience) will decide, which is less rational. Practical reasons provide rational, agent-centered guidance precisely where truth-aim alone is indeterminate.  \n\nObjection 3: Excessive Stringency.  \nLexical priority seems harsh; it implies that in life-or-death cases where evidence is poor, belief is still wrong. But isn\u2019t doxastic courage admirable?  \n\nReply: What is admirable may not be belief but hope, commitment, or imaginative rehearsal\u2014attitudes not subject to the same epistemic norms. Our framework preserves room for non-doxastic attitudes that perform the practical function without violating the epistemic norm. This demarcation actually enhances, rather than hampers, our normative repertoire.  \n\nV. Why Not the Rivals?  \n\n1. Pragmatic Encroachment  \nThis view holds that practical stakes *alter* epistemic justification conditions. But then epistemology loses autonomy; whether your evidence suffices to know that the bank is open depends on how much money you risk. Our two-level model preserves the intuition that evidence alone fixes epistemic warrant while still letting prudence matter downstream.  \n\n2. Hybrid Weighing Accounts  \nOn a \u201cconjunctive\u201d view, we simply sum epistemic and practical weights on one scale. But absent a commensurating metric, such summation is mystifying. Worse, it predicts that enough practical benefit can offset virtually certain falsity, licensing wishful belief. Lexical priority blocks that slide by making epistemic adequacy a non-negotiable constraint.  \n\n3. Pure Dualism (\u201cTwo Oughts, No Integration\u201d)  \nSome philosophers retreat to saying: \u201cWe have an epistemic ought and a practical ought; sometimes they conflict, and that\u2019s that.\u201d Yet real agents must act under a single, integrated deliberation. My model offers that integration without erasing the domains, by embedding them sequentially.  \n\nVI. Implications and Closing Thoughts  \n\nA. Doxastic Permissivism  \nThe account relies on epistemic permissivism: evidence often underdetermines unique rational belief. Some reject permissivism, but denying it renders the interaction problem moot\u2014for if evidence always fixes belief uniquely, practical reasons have no foothold. Given the ubiquity of underdetermination, permissivism is the more realistic backdrop.  \n\nB. Higher-Order Evidence  \nWhat if I acquire evidence that my cognitive processes are biased? That is epistemic evidence\u2014and thus enters at Stage 1\u2014possibly shrinking the permissive set S. Practical reasons never outrank higher-order epistemic reasons, preserving lexical prioritization.  \n\nC. Ethics of Belief and Social Epistemology  \nIn domains like climate science or public health, practical stakes are enormous. Yet our model forbids adjusting belief in defiance of evidence. It does, however, support emphasis on precautionary beliefs whenever evidence leaves room for several attitudes. This clarifies how policymakers can both \u201cfollow the science\u201d and responsibly account for social welfare.  \n\nD. Faith, Hope, and Non-Doxastic Attitudes  \nRecognizing the boundary where belief is impermissible but hope is rational helps rehabilitate Jamesian insights without sacrificing epistemic integrity. We may permissibly *hope* beyond the evidence even when we may not *believe*.  \n\nE. Future Research  \nThe lexical model invites formalization. One can treat epistemic reasons as constraints generating a feasible set, with practical reasons ranking elements. Decision-theoretic tools (e.g., constrained optimization) then apply. This suggests a productive bridge between epistemology and decision theory: instead of collapsing belief into credence, we treat belief as a binary choice under constraints.  \n\nConclusion  \nEpistemic and practical reasons need not be incommensurable rivals battling on a single scale. They occupy different normative levels. Epistemic reasons speak first, setting the boundaries of rational belief; practical reasons speak second, guiding us within those boundaries. The structure is lexical, not aggregative. Once this division of labor is recognized, familiar puzzles\u2014James\u2019s stranded sailor, placebo beliefs, high-stakes engineering\u2014fall into place. We honor the constitutive aim of belief while acknowledging the practical texture of human agency. In an imperfect world where our evidence is rarely decisive, that two-level, priority-respecting harmony is the best rational ideal we can hope for.", "output_tokens": 2996, "reasoning_tokens": 384}

Epistemic reasons (ERs) concern the truth or probability of p, whereas practical reasons (PRs) concern the goodness of your being in a doxastic state with respect to p. If ERs point one way and PRs the other, how could an \u201call-things-considered\u201d (ATC) verdict be anything but mystically arbitrary? We do not have a common currency: truth-likeness is not a more or less valuable form of utility, and moral value is not a shadowy species of evidence. Call this the incommensurability worry.\n\nThesis.  \nThe worry rests on a conflation. ERs and PRs do not compete at the same normative level. Epistemic reasons bear directly on the correctness of a *belief state*, while practical reasons bear primarily on the *management of one\u2019s doxastic life*\u2014that is, on actions (broadly construed) such as inquiring, keeping an open mind, or even deciding to enter contexts that predictably trigger certain beliefs. When they seem to interact, what is really happening is that (i) practical reasons operate at a higher, policy-like level that can permissibly constrain which ERs come to bear, and (ii) within the envelope of epistemic permissibility\u2014when ERs do not uniquely settle the matter\u2014PRs can legitimately \u201cbreak ties.\u201d Thus the two kinds of reasons are *hierarchically integrated* rather than *weighed on a scale*. The appearance of incommensurability dissolves once we distinguish the levels.\n\nRoad Map.  \n1. Clarify the kinds of reasons and the \u201coughts\u201d they address.  \n2. Introduce the two-level framework and show how it handles paradigm cases.  \n3. Defend the framework against three families of objection: Evidentialist, Pragmatist, and Encroachment objections.  \n4. Draw three further theoretical payoffs: a principled account of Jamesian faith, guidance for suspension of judgment, and a reconciliation of moral encroachment debates.  \n5. Conclude with dialectical implications.\n\n1. Taxonomy of Reasons and Oughts  \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n1.1 First-Order Epistemic Ought (Oe).  \nOe(p) concerns *the correctness of believing p*. The relevant reasons are ERs: indications that p is true or likely.\n\n1.2 Higher-Order Practical Ought (Op).  \nOp concerns *what to do in managing one\u2019s doxastic economy*. That includes whether to seek more evidence, avoid temptation, adopt a policy of credal conservatism, etc. PRs bear here.\n\n1.3 All-Things-Considered Rational Ought (O*).  \nWhat the agent, *qua practical agent*, ought to do or be, taking account of every reason whatsoever. O* is the norm invoked in ordinary deliberation (\u201cWhat should I do now?\u201d). Importantly, O* always concerns an action or policy; it never directly mandates a propositional attitude in violation of Oe.\n\n1.4 Key Distinction: State vs. Act Reasons.  \n\u2022 ERs are *state-directed*: they speak to whether a state correctly represents the world.  \n\u2022 PRs are *act-directed*: they speak to whether entering, retaining, or preventing a state advances legitimate aims.  \nBecause adopting a belief is not a basic intentional act under typical human cognitive architecture\u2014we cannot believe \u201cat will\u201d\u2014it is already plausible that PRs latch onto upstream acts (looking away from misleading evidence) or downstream ones (placing a bet), not the bare believing.\n\n2. The Two-Level Framework  \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nLevel-1 Normativity: ERs Fix Epistemic Permissibility.  \nGiven your total evidence E, some doxastic states toward p are ruled out as epistemically impermissible (e.g., high confidence in \u00acp when E strongly supports p). Others are ruled in. Call the ruled-in set Perm(E).\n\nLevel-2 Normativity: PRs Guide Selection Within Perm(E) and Choice of Epistemic Policies.  \nSuppose Perm(E) includes believing p to degree .6, suspending, or believing \u00acp to degree .45. Now PRs can favor one of these permissible states. If believing p would spare a life-shattering harm at negligible moral or prudential cost, Op might favor adopting the .6 credence rather than suspending. Conversely, if the stakes are symmetric or favor caution, Op might direct suspension.\n\nInteraction Principle (IP).  \n(1) Lexical Priority: If ERs uniquely require attitude A (i.e., Perm(E) is singleton {A}), then O* entails A irrespective of PRs. PRs cannot make a non-truth-conducive attitude correct.  \n(2) Permissive Tie-Breaking: If Perm(E) contains multiple permissible attitudes, PRs may select among them.  \n(3) Policy Mediation: PRs may also direct which evidence to gather, which heuristics or epistemic standards to adopt, and which situations to enter, thereby indirectly shaping future Perm(E).\n\nThis architecture allows \u201cinteraction\u201d without commensuration. We never weigh ERs against PRs at point-blank range; rather, we treat ERs as generating constraints and PRs as operating inside (or on the boundaries of) those constraints.\n\n2.1 Paradigm Cases  \n\nCase 1: The Medical Test.  \nDana\u2019s evidence makes it 70% probable she has disease D; treatment is onerous but harmless if taken unnecessarily, catastrophic if omitted when D is present. Perm(E) allows belief to degree .7 or suspension. PRs (avoid catastrophic outcome) favor the doxastic state \u201cbehave as if D\u201d or form the tentative belief that D. IP says this is permissible because ERs did not uniquely require suspension.\n\nCase 2: The Wishful Believer.  \nEvan faces overwhelming evidence that his partner is unfaithful. Believing otherwise would spare him anguish. Here Perm(E) is singleton {believe up to high credence in infidelity}. PRs that favor comfort cannot override, so Evan ought not believe innocence even ATC.\n\nCase 3: Religious Faith \u00e0 la James.  \nEvidence for God\u2019s existence is ambiguous; both belief and disbelief are ER-permissible. The \u201cforced, live, momentous option\u201d constitutes a strong PR for belief (e.g., transformative value). Under IP, Jamesian faith is rationally permissible; it is not epistemically compelled, but nor is it rationally forbidden.\n\n3. Answering Objections  \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n3.1 Evidentialist Objection (\u201cCliffordian Purity\u201d)  \nClaim: Even in tie cases, belief must not outrun evidence; suspension is the only epistemically proper attitude.\n\nReply: Clifford\u2019s purity is a substantive thesis about Perm(E), not about interaction. If one adopts a non-permissive evidentialism, then Perm(E) is almost always singleton {suspend}. IP still holds; PRs cannot override. The dispute is over the size of Perm(E), not the architecture itself. Moreover, overly stringent Perm(E) undermines inquiry: scientists routinely accept working hypotheses on thin evidence to run experiments; that practice would be epistemically verboten, an unacceptable reductio.\n\n3.2 Pragmatist Objection  \nPragmatists (e.g., Quine, Rorty) deny any sui generis epistemic norm: all justification ultimately appeals to utility within a language game.\n\nReply: The two-level view can absorb the grain of truth\u2014belief aims at successful coping\u2014without collapsing ERs into PRs. Even the most instrumentalist account must acknowledge that success-conducive beliefs are those that *accurately* represent the environment. Truth is the mediating variable; that\u2019s why the pragmatic calculus defers to evidence in low-stake situations. The lexical priority of truth in non-permissive cases is thus vindicated even on pragmatist motivations.\n\n3.3 Encroachment Objection  \nRecent work on \u201cpragmatic encroachment\u201d holds that PRs can affect the *threshold* of knowledge or justification, making epistemic norms themselves stake-sensitive.\n\nReply: IP is compatible with a modest encroachment thesis. PRs can legitimately alter which error-cost profile you ought to adopt, and that in turn affects the evidence-required threshold. But that is precisely the Policy Mediation clause: PRs shape the standard of evidence you should set for yourself, not the weighing of concrete ERs against PRs. Once the standard is adopted, ERs decide the matter. Thus the framework can accommodate encroachment phenomena without surrendering the state/act distinction.\n\n4. Theoretical Payoffs  \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n4.1 Formalizing Jamesian Faith  \nWe can model Perm(E) as a credal interval [L, U]. PRs supply a utility function over attitude-action pairs. Maximizing expected utility subject to the constraint that credence c \u2208 [L, U] yields determinate guidance. This captures why faith can be both epistemically permissible and practically rational, defusing the verdict that James\u2019s \u201cwill to believe\u201d smuggles in wishful thinking.\n\n4.2 Guidance for Rational Suspension  \nSuspension often seems epistemically safe but practically costly (e.g., vaccine hesitancy). IP directs us: if evidence is good enough that belief is permissible, and PRs strongly favor decisive action, suspension is irrational\u2014even though it is never strictly ruled out by Oe. This refines \u201cClifford\u2019s evidentialism\u201d by showing why it can be overcautious.\n\n4.3 Reconciling Moral Encroachment  \nMoral encroachers argue that morally significant error profiles raise the epistemic bar (e.g., believing a stereotype on statistical evidence). Under Policy Mediation, morality can raise the bar by mandating a \u201cdo-no-harm\u201d epistemic policy. But once the higher standard is fixed, ERs alone adjudicate whether the belief meets it. Thus moral encroachment is explained without positing queer hybrid reasons.\n\n5. Dialectical Implications  \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n1. Against Collapse Theories. Hybrid or monistic theories that try to reduce PRs to ERs (or vice-versa) mislocate the site of interaction and either (a) trivialize truth-aiming normativity (if everything is ultimately utility) or (b) mystify moral stakes as evidence (if everything is ultimately truth). The two-level view respects both domains.\n\n2. Against Incommensurability. The alleged inability to weigh ERs and PRs arises only if we insist on a single, flat decision space. Once we adopt IP, the seeming need for commensuration evaporates. Constraints plus tie-breaking is a familiar decision-theoretic structure.\n\n3. For Doxastic Agency. The picture vindicates a modest doxastic voluntarism: while one cannot simply \u201cbelieve at will,\u201d one can control the upstream acts (seeking evidence) and downstream acts (avowing, acting on) that constitute doxastic management. Practical reasons rationally bear on those acts, solving puzzles about moral blameworthiness for belief.\n\nConclusion.  \nThere is no mysterious weighing of truth against utility. Instead, epistemic reasons constrain; practical reasons select within the unconstrained space and guide the policies that determine future constraints. The hierarchical architecture dissolves the incommensurability worry while preserving what is compelling in both evidentialist and pragmatist insights. We thereby obtain an integrated, non-mysterious account of what we ought, all things considered, to believe\u2014and, crucially, of how we ought to *manage* our believing.", "output_tokens": 2906, "reasoning_tokens": 448}

Introduction and Thesis  \n\nDeliberators sometimes find themselves pulled in two directions. The evidence says p is probably false, yet believing p would spare someone grievous harm; or the evidence says q is extremely likely, yet believing it would be cruel or self-destructive. Many philosophers react by splitting the normative landscape: on the one hand, epistemic reasons that derive from truth-conduciveness; on the other, practical reasons that derive from value, welfare, or morality. The puzzle is then: if epistemic reasons point one way and practical reasons another, and if they are different not only in direction but in kind, how could they ever add up to one \u201call-things-considered\u201d verdict about what one ought to believe? Aren\u2019t they incommensurable in principle?\n\nMy thesis is three-part.  \n\nA. There is indeed a single, genuinely all-things-considered normative \u201cought\u201d that can apply to belief. We are sometimes obligated\u2014full stop\u2014to believe or refrain from believing.  \n\nB. Epistemic and practical reasons can interact because they do share a common normative property: they are considerations that bear on whether adopting the belief would make one\u2019s overall doxastic state better to have, given one\u2019s evaluative standards. While their *content* differs (truth-value vs. welfare value), their *normative role* is identical.  \n\nC. Once we see that, we can model their interaction by a two-tier system. At the first tier, a lexical priority is accorded to epistemic reasons: barring ties in evidential weight, truth tends to trump; but when evidential reasons leave a wide interval of rationally permissible credences, practical reasons legitimately break the tie. At the second tier, when the gap between what the evidence supports and what one is asked to believe is great, the epistemic cost must be correspondingly counterbalanced by exceptional practical stakes\u2014an idea formalizable by multi-attribute decision theory. The union of these two tiers yields a principled, rather than ad hoc, method for combining unlike reasons without forcing them onto a single crude scale.\n\nI defend this view in five stages: (2) clarifying the taxonomy of \u201coughts\u201d; (3) diagnosing the appearance of incommensurability; (4) surveying extant strategies and their limits; (5) introducing the two-tier proposal; and (6) meeting three leading objections. Along the way I use concrete cases\u2014Pascal\u2019s Wager, the cancer patient\u2019s comforting falsehood, and \u201cmoral encroachment\u201d scenarios\u2014to show how the model works in practice.\n\n2. Two Kinds of \u201cOught\u201d and Why One Is Not Enough  \n\nA tempting dissolution of the puzzle says that there is no single question \u201cWhat ought I to believe?\u201d but two separate ones. \u201cEpistemically, ought I believe p?\u201d is answered solely by evidence; \u201cPractically, ought I (in the deliberative sense of deciding whether to adopt) the belief that p?\u201d is answered by consequences. On this *bifurcation* view, there is no need to weigh unlike reasons; we simply respect two autonomous domains.\n\nYet we do not live in two domains. The scientist asked in court to commit perjury must decide what to do *simpliciter*, not only \u201cepistemically\u201d or \u201cpractically.\u201d There is a standpoint from which we criticize the conspiracy theorist even if her beliefs bring her comfort, and from which we blame the bystander who clings to agnostic hope that the drowning child might survive without help. Everyday practice presupposes an all-in assessment: the reasons, whatever their type, speak to *one deliberative question*: What should I believe, period? A normative theory that cannot deliver that verdict is incomplete.\n\n3. Why the Reasons Look Incommensurable  \n\nThe sense that epistemic and practical reasons cannot be weighed together arises from two features:\n\na) Different objectives. Epistemic reasons aim at accuracy; practical reasons at value. Unless we reduce value to accuracy or vice versa, there seems no common metric.\n\nb) Different basing relations. Epistemic reasons support belief when the belief is *caused* in the right way by the evidence; practical reasons seem to support belief by *motivating* its adoption. Mixing causes looks like a category mistake.\n\nBoth points are potent. However, noting them does not entail that the reasons are incomparable. Consider dietary reasons: health reasons (nutrient content) and hedonic reasons (taste) have different objectives and different causal roles, yet we routinely integrate them when deciding what to eat. Normative conflict across value dimensions is ubiquitous; philosophy\u2019s task is not to deny integration but to make it coherent.\n\n4. Existing Strategies  \n\n(i) Pure Evidentialism. Pure evidentialists (e.g., Clifford) deny that practical reasons ever bear on belief. Belief falls under an epistemic \u201cought\u201d only; practical reasons bear only on actions derivatively connected to belief (seeking evidence, avoiding temptations to self-deception). This view solves the weighting problem by sidestepping it, but at the cost of clashing with deeply held moral judgments. Consider \u201cBeneficial Delusion\u201d: a doctor can instill a placebo belief that dramatically improves a child\u2019s survival odds. Pure evidentialism condemns the doctor\u2019s act as strictly irrational, yet many judge it permissible, even obligatory.\n\n(ii) Pragmatism. William James famously held that practical stakes can *license* believing beyond the evidence when the hypothesis is a genuine option. Contemporary pragmatists (e.g., pragmatic encroachment theorists) add that the evidence threshold for knowledge itself shifts with stakes. They thus collapse the two domains by letting practical considerations alter what counts as sufficient evidence. The worry is arbitrariness: if every practical benefit can tweak evidential thresholds, we risk undermining the distinction between believing for truth and believing for comfort.\n\n(iii) Separate Spheres Plus Defeasibility. A more nuanced view (e.g., Reisner; Lord) keeps the domains distinct but lets practical reasons sometimes defeat or silence epistemic reasons in an \u201call-things-considered\u201d calculus. Yet without saying how defeat is determined, the theory re-invokes incommensurability under another name.\n\nEach strategy captures something important\u2014truth\u2019s priority, the influence of stakes, the unity of normative verdicts\u2014but none simultaneously honors all three.\n\n5. The Two-Tier Model  \n\nTo integrate the insights and avoid the pitfalls, I propose a two-tier model:\n\nTier 1. Lexical Priority of Evidential Reasons.  \n\u2022 Epistemic reasons generate a *default requirement* to match one\u2019s credence to the evidential probability of p (subject to practical constraints like cognitive capacity).  \n\u2022 When the evidence yields a sharp credal recommendation (e.g., probability 0.95), no amount of ordinary practical benefit can rationalize a sharply opposed belief. Call this the \u201cevidential floor.\u201d\n\nTier 2. Practical Tie-Breaking within the Epistemic Permissibility Interval.  \n\u2022 Often the evidence is indeterminate or equivocal, permitting a range of rational credences\u2014for instance, between .4 and .6. Within that interval, practical reasons may legitimately resolve which precise point, or whether to move from suspension to outright belief.  \n\u2022 When practical stakes are extraordinary, they can license *stretching* the interval, but only up to the point where the expected epistemic disutility (probability \u00d7 distance from truth) is compensated by the practical utility. The higher the epistemic cost, the higher the practical threshold.\n\nHow does this avoid commensurability worries? By not forcing truth and practical value onto a single linear scale. Instead, we recognize a *lexical* structure: truth matters first; only when truth-orientation underdetermines belief do other values enter. Yet because underdetermination is common, practical reasons frequently have real, but bounded, influence. Multi-attribute decision theory formalizes this by positing a lexicographic ordering: attribute A (accuracy) dominates attribute B (practical payoff) except where A-difference is below a just-noticeable threshold d; within that zone, B decides. This parallels well-studied decision models in environmental policy that give lexical precedence to safety but allow cost-benefit reasoning once a safety standard is met.\n\n6. Case Studies  \n\nCase 1. Pascal\u2019s Wager.  \nPascal\u2019s evidence for God\u2019s existence is weak, but the practical payoff (eternal salvation) is astronomically high. On the two-tier model, Tier 1 says the epistemic floor is agnosticism. However, the potential payoff is not merely ordinary\u2014it is infinite. The practical reason thus meets the exceptional-stakes clause, overriding the floor. Believing is rationally permissible (subject to voluntariness issues, discussed below). Notice that the model predicts Pascalian wagering is much harder to justify for finite but large goods (say, avoiding mild embarrassment), thereby vindicating common-sense gradations.\n\nCase 2. Placebo for a Dying Child.  \nEvidence that the placebo works via belief alone is strong; evidence for the proposition \u201cthe new drug will cure you\u201d is slim. Here, Tier 1 sets the floor at low credence. The practical benefit\u2014saving a life\u2014is extraordinary, but the epistemic cost\u2014believing an outright falsehood\u2014may also be high. Whether the cost is outweighed depends on details: alternative treatments, risk of later disillusionment, and so on. The model does not deliver an a priori mandate but gives a framework for making the stakes explicit, allowing moral reasoning to proceed without dismissing truth concerns.\n\nCase 3. Moral Encroachment.  \nSuppose a hiring committee sees statistical evidence that members of group G have slightly lower average productivity. Epistemically, a small credence adjustment is warranted; practically and morally, relying on the base rate risks wrongful discrimination. The evidential gap between rational credence .55 and belief that an individual candidate is unfit is large. Lexical priority blocks the leap. Within the credal band, however, moral reasons can require *ignoring* tiny differences and treating candidates as equal. The model thus respects both anti-discrimination norms and evidential rationality.\n\n7. Objections and Replies  \n\nObjection 1: Doxastic Involuntarism.  \nWe cannot directly choose beliefs, so practical reasons cannot be reasons to believe.  \n\nReply. Even if belief is not directly under volitional control, we influence it by attending, seeking or avoiding evidence, rehearsing considerations, joining communities, and so on. Reasons that guide those control-points are reasons *about* what to believe, in the sense relevant to normativity. Moreover, the objection proves too much\u2014if lack of direct control eliminated reasons, we would have no epistemic reasons either, yet clearly we do.\n\nObjection 2: Contamination of Evidence.  \nAllowing practical reasons to weigh at all risks polluting doxastic deliberation; we will subconsciously distort evidence to suit our interests.  \n\nReply. The danger is real but manageable. The two-tier model insulates core belief-forming processes (Tier 1) from practical intrusion; only after evidential processing sets the permissible credal interval do practical stakes come in. We thereby preserve the *epistemic basing* relation while still permitting the agent to note, consciously, whether the difference between credence .49 and .51 matters for action.\n\nObjection 3: Lexical Priority Is Ad Hoc.  \nWhy should epistemic reasons take precedence rather than, say, moral reasons?  \n\nReply. The priority mirrors the constitutive aim of belief. To count as the state it is, belief must aim at truth. Just as promises constitutively aim at being kept, beliefs constitutively aim at accuracy. This gives truth a default weight no other consideration shares. Yet constitutive aim need not be absolute; even promises can be overridden (e.g., to prevent great harm). Lexical-with-escape-clause captures that structure\u2014truth first, but not at all costs.\n\n8. Relation to Broader Normative Theory  \n\nThe two-tier model fits a general picture of *hybrid value pragmatism*: different value dimensions interact through structured aggregation rather than brute commensuration. Parallel cases arise in medical ethics (patient autonomy vs. beneficence), environmental law (safety vs. cost), and legal evidence (truth vs. fairness). There too we often find lexical or threshold arrangements. The proposal thus situates doxastic normativity within a well-explored family of plural-value decision frameworks.\n\n9. Substantive Payoffs  \n\nA. It explains why \u201cwishful thinking\u201d remains culpable even if comforting: the epistemic floor is violated.  \nB. It dignifies Jamesian insights about stakes without letting them run amok.  \nC. It clarifies contemporary debates on moral encroachment, showing why some but not all practical considerations reshape evidential standards.  \nD. It furnishes empirical researchers with testable predictions: belief change should track practical stakes only when evidence is ambiguous; where evidence is decisive, stakes should have minimal impact.\n\n10. Conclusion  \n\nThe initial worry\u2014that epistemic and practical reasons are incommensurable\u2014rests on conflating difference in *content* with difference in *normative currency*. Reasons of both kinds count because each is a consideration in favor of occupying a certain cognitive stance given one\u2019s standards for how a life\u2014including its doxastic component\u2014should go. By giving epistemic reasons lexical priority yet allowing practical reasons regulated space to operate, we combine respect for belief\u2019s constitutive link to truth with sensitivity to the fact that believing is something done by flesh-and-blood agents whose lives, projects, and morals matter. In so doing, we secure a unified, non-arbitary \u201cought-to-believe\u201d that reflects, rather than evades, the rich plurality of reasons that move rational creatures like us.", "output_tokens": 3540, "reasoning_tokens": 576}

The tug-of-war between \u201cbelieve what the evidence indicates\u201d and \u201cbelieve what would be best for me (or for others)\u201d looks at first like a clash between two currencies that cannot be exchanged.  Gold cannot be added to temperatures, and epistemic probability cannot be added to moral value.  Yet ordinary language encourages precisely that fusion: we say both \u201cyou ought to believe the doctor\u201d (because of the medical evidence) and \u201cyou ought not to believe that hateful rumour\u201d (because it would harm an innocent person).  How, if at all, can these \u2018oughts\u2019 be combined into a single, all-things-considered directive?\n\nI shall argue for a two-level solution.\n\n1.  There is a constitutive epistemic norm of belief: qua belief, a state is correct just in case its content is true.  Epistemic reasons track that constitutive aim by indicating truth-conduciveness.  They therefore enjoy lexical priority in assessments of the correctness or rationality of a belief.\n\n2.  Practical reasons do not bear on the correctness of a belief but on what we ought to do with respect to believing\u2014e.g. whether to seek, avoid, or maintain a given belief, or to adopt doxastic surrogates such as acceptance in inquiry.  Conflicts between the two kinds of reasons thus occur not within a single dimension but across two distinct \u2018oughts\u2019: an epistemic ought directed at the content of belief itself and a practical ought directed at our management of believing.\n\nOnce the distinction between \u201cwhat is it correct to believe?\u201d and \u201cwhat should I try (or refrain from trying) to believe?\u201d is kept in view, the spectre of incommensurability dissolves.  There is indeed no common scale for truth and welfare; but they were never competing for the same slot on the scale in the first place.  Below I spell out the view, defend it against prominent rivals, and show how it handles the hardest cases of apparent conflict.\n\nI.  The Conceptual Priority of Epistemic Reasons\n\nA.  The Aim of Belief  \nBelief is not merely a disposition to act as though p; it is a state that is assessable for truth.  As philosophers from Bernard Williams to Nishi Shah have pressed, the very concept of belief is \u201ctransparent\u201d: once one sees that the evidence favours p, belief automatically commends itself, and pretending otherwise feels like self-betrayal.  In slogan form: belief aims at truth.\n\nThat constitutive aim yields what one might call the \u2018fittingness norm\u2019:\n\n(F) A belief that p is fitting (correct) iff p is true.\n\nEpistemic reasons, then, are simply considerations that indicate truth or raise the probability of truth.  They are internally linked to what belief is.\n\nB.  Lexical Priority for Correctness Judgments  \nIf epistemic reasons track the constitutive aim of belief, then in judgments about whether a belief is rational or correct, nothing can override them.  Compare: in judging whether an act of promise-keeping is honest, practical reasons about utility cannot change the verdict; honesty is internally fixed by fidelity to one\u2019s word.  Likewise, practical considerations about happiness or harm cannot make a false belief correct.  \n\nSo: epistemic reasons are not merely one contributory factor among others in evaluations of a belief\u2019s epistemic status; they fully determine that status.\n\nII.  What Work Is Left for Practical Reasons?\n\nPractical considerations do bear on doxastic matters, but not at the first-order level of correctness.  They matter for agency concerning belief: whether it is worth trying to get into or to stay out of a given doxastic state.  Call these managerial questions doxastic choice problems.  They are structurally akin to medical decisions: a doctor\u2019s reason for performing risky surgery does not alter whether the patient will in fact recover, but it does bear on whether the doctor should operate.\n\nTwo species of practical reasons for (or against) believing are especially salient:\n\n1.  Instrumental reasons: Believing p would bring about desirable consequences\u2014peace of mind, social cohesion, therapeutic benefit.\n\n2.  Moral reasons: Believing (or refusing to believe) p honours or violates moral duties\u2014avoiding doxastic wronging, refusing hateful stereotypes, sustaining hope that enables collective resistance.\n\nThese are genuine reasons in the practical domain, but they are aimed at what we should do vis-\u00e0-vis belief, not at what it is correct to believe.\n\nIII.  Distinguishing Two Questions, Two \u2018Oughts\u2019\n\nMany apparent collisions between truth and utility arise from sliding between two different normatively loaded questions:\n\n(Q1) Epistemic: Is it rational (fitting, correct) to believe p?\n\n(Q2) Practical: Should I undertake, continue, or refrain from bringing about belief that p?\n\nBecause these questions target different objects\u2014the content of belief in one case, the action of managing belief in the other\u2014answers to them come from different normative domains.  The upshot:\n\n\u2022 Only epistemic reasons bear on (Q1).  \n\u2022 Practical reasons can bear on (Q2), sometimes jointly with epistemic reasons, because whether to try for belief may depend both on its truth-likelihood and on its utility.\n\nIV.  Three Rival Strategies and Their Troubles\n\nA.  Simple Weighing (Pragmatic Encroachment)  \nOn pragmatic encroachment views, epistemic and practical reasons contribute to a single threshold for knowledge or justified belief.  If the stakes are high, practical reasons can raise the evidential bar.  Critics have objected that this undermines the transparency of belief; the evidential situation could be unchanged while the agent both sees that her evidence suffices and sees that the stakes forbid belief\u2014a schizophrenic attitude.\n\nMoreover, the view mislocates practical import: the danger of a false belief may be a reason not to rely on that belief in action, but it does not affect whether the belief fits the evidence.\n\nB.  Exclusive Evidentialism  \nOther philosophers deny that practical reasons have any doxastic relevance.  On strict evidentialism, only epistemic reasons matter, full stop.  That position leaves us unable to explain familiar normative talk\u2014e.g. that one should not believe the malignant rumour even if the evidence slightly favours it, at least until after checking, because of the probable harm.  Such advice is intelligible and action-guiding; the evidentialist must treat it as mere advice to gather more evidence, which feels ad hoc.\n\nC.  Dilemma Pluralism (No Fact of the Matter)  \nA third response concedes both types of reasons but claims they generate incommensurable oughts that never consolidate into an all-things-considered verdict.  Sometimes, then, there is just no fact about whether one ought simpliciter to believe.  While normative indeterminacy is possible, treating every hard case as indeterminate empties normative guidance of its practical point.\n\nV.  The Two-Level Account in Action\n\nA.  Comforting Falsehood  \nSuppose a physician lies to a terminal patient, \u201cYou will recover,\u201d to bolster hope.  Epistemically, the belief is unfounded; the patient oughtep to disbelieve it.  Practically, because hope may extend life or at least ease suffering, the physician has weighty reasons to induce that very belief.  There is no contradiction: the patient\u2019s belief is epistemically irrational, yet the doctor\u2019s action is (arguably) morally justified.  \n\nB.  High-Stakes Safety  \nA climber checks her gear.  Evidence that the rope is sound is 90%.  Epistemically that supports belief it is safe.  Practically, if failure is fatal, she has strong reason not to rely on that belief and instead to test again.  She therefore oughtpr to suspend or at least to double-check.  Again, the two verdicts coexist without conflict once their targets are kept apart.\n\nC.  Doxastic Wronging  \nRecent work on \u201cdoxastic wronging\u201d (Basu, Schroeder) claims that certain beliefs, even if well-evidenced, wrong their objects\u2014e.g. believing a friend cheated on an exam.  The present framework translates the intuition: epistemically the suspicion is justified; morally one ought not voice or act on it until seeking confirmation, because the act of believing threatens the friendship.  What matters morally is the way one manages the belief, not its internal correctness.\n\nVI.  Objections and Replies\n\n1.  Objection: The managerial/practical distinction is a dodge; we can have direct practical reason to believe itself, not merely to produce belief.\n\nReply: The \u2018transparency\u2019 of belief makes direct voluntary control over its adoption dubious.  One cannot believe at will for the sake of benefit unless self-deception intervenes.  Where voluntary control is absent, practical reasons apply most naturally to the actions\u2014seeking or avoiding evidence, placing oneself in certain environments\u2014that predictably result in belief, rather than to the believing as such.\n\n2.  Objection: Moral encroachment research shows that moral stakes affect whether evidence suffices for knowledge (e.g., that a witness is trustworthy).\n\nReply: The data show that we often retract attributions of \u2018knows\u2019 when stakes rise, but that linguistic phenomenon can be explained through conversational pragmatics: high stakes trigger stricter practical requirements on assertion, not new epistemic standards.  The belief remains justified; what shifts is whether it is prudent to act on.\n\n3.  Objection: The view multiplies oughts to the point of confusion.  Ordinary speakers rarely distinguish \u2018epistemic ought\u2019 from \u2018practical ought\u2019.\n\nReply: Ordinary talk is replete with domain-specific oughts\u2014legal, prudential, aesthetic\u2014without chaos.  \u201cYou really ought not violate the noise ordinance\u201d can coexist with \u201cArtistically you ought to go big.\u201d  Our ear for context sorts them.  Philosophical analysis merely makes the implicit background explicit.\n\nVII.  Why No Weighing Is Needed\n\nThe root of the original puzzle was the assumption that, if two considerations are both termed \u2018reasons for belief,\u2019 they must compete within a single register.  But the shape of belief\u2019s normativity blocks that move.\n\n\u2022 Epistemic reasons answer a constitutive correctness question.  \n\u2022 Practical reasons answer agency questions about managing doxastic life.\n\nConsequently, there is nothing for them to weigh against each other.  The seeming incommensurability is an artefact of collapsing two normative roles into one.\n\nVIII.  Residual Unity: Higher-Order Synthesis\n\nMust we forever keep two ledgers?  Sometimes practical and epistemic deliberations do converge in higher-order reasoning.  An inquirer who values truth instrumentally as well as intrinsically will often find that following the evidence also optimises practical outcomes; science, medicine, and policy thrive on that harmony.  Where they diverge, the agent\u2019s practical judgment\u2014guided by her total set of values\u2014decides whether to embark on actions that increase or decrease the likelihood of coming to believe.  What the agent may not do, on pain of conceptual incoherence, is announce that a consideration of utility renders a falsehood epistemically correct.\n\nIX.  Advantages of the Two-Level Picture\n\n1.  Preserves the internal connection between belief and truth, respecting the transparency phenomenon.  \n2.  Makes room for the widespread intuition that there are moral and prudential constraints on doxastic life.  \n3.  Explains why the same body of evidence can leave different agents with different all-things-considered directives, depending on their risk profiles and moral commitments, without making epistemic warrant relative.  \n4.  Avoids the need for a \u201ccommon currency\u201d among heterogeneous values, because the values operate in non-competing spheres.\n\nX.  Conclusion\n\nEpistemic and practical reasons do not form a single scale because they are not aimed at the same normative target.  Epistemic reasons answer the question of correctness that is built into the very nature of belief.  Practical reasons guide our agency with respect to believing\u2014when to inquire, when to postpone judgment, when to insulate ourselves from tempting falsehoods, and (rarely) when even to risk self-deception for a higher moral end.  Recognising these two levels both defuses the charge of incommensurability and yields an integrated, though non-monolithic, normative landscape: truth governs the internal standard of belief; value governs the external management of our doxastic lives.  The result is not a cacophony of incompatible oughts but a duet in which each voice occupies its own register, harmonising only where the music calls for it and never forced into unison where the score demands counterpoint.", "output_tokens": 3730, "reasoning_tokens": 1024}

Unlike intending, promising, or hoping, it is aimed at the truth: to believe that p is, at least in part, to take p to be how things are.  Yet, as William Clifford already worried in the nineteenth century, believing can help or harm, comfort or endanger, respect or wrong other people.  That dual aspect has inspired contemporary debates over \u201cepistemic\u201d versus \u201cpractical\u201d reasons for belief.  Epistemic reasons are paradigmatically evidence-based: a reliable thermometer\u2019s reading is a reason to believe the room is 22 \u00b0C because it indicates that the proposition is true.  Practical reasons are value-based: the proposition\u2019s being comforting, identity-affirming, or conducive to social trust may also be cited as a reason to believe it.  The puzzle is how these reasons, apparently incommensurable, could jointly determine what one *ought* to believe.  If truth-conduciveness and welfare pull in opposite directions, how could they be weighed on a single scale?\n\nI shall defend a *Conditional Priority Model* that preserves the distinctness of the two kinds of reasons while explaining their interaction.  The model has three theses.\n\n1.  Epistemic and practical reasons answer to different constitutive aims of belief\u2014accuracy and value\u2014but they are nonetheless commensurable at the level of *agency* rather than at the level of *content*.\n\n2.  Because belief\u2019s *constitutive* aim is accuracy, epistemic reasons enjoy *default lexical priority*: where the practical stakes are ordinary, what one epistemically ought to believe is what one all-things-considered ought to believe.\n\n3.  Practical reasons can override that default when the pragmatic stakes exceed a context-sensitive threshold fixed by the value we (qua agents) place on truth in comparison with the particular practical goods at issue.  The threshold can be modelled decision-theoretically and vindicates the intuitive judgments that (i) some high-stakes cases license non-evidential belief, yet (ii) Clifford-style worries remain forceful in most daily contexts.\n\nThis account, I shall argue, respects the phenomenology of deliberation, avoids sceptical costs, and answers the incommensurability worry by relocating commensurability from the level of *reasons as such* to the level of *the agent\u2019s higher-order normative standpoint*.\n\nI.  Situating the Problem\n\nFour standard responses dominate the literature.\n\nA.  Strong Evidentialism (SEP).  Only epistemic reasons bear on belief.  If it is practically useful to believe that the stock market will rise, that \u201creason\u201d is at best a reason to *want* the belief, not to *hold* it.  SEP avoids incommensurability by eliminating one pole.\n\nB.  Distinct-Ought Pluralism.  There is an epistemic \u201cought\u201d and a practical \u201cought\u201d, each univocal within its domain but not aggregable.  The racer who ought*practically* to believe her brakes work (to calm her nerves) may concurrently ought*epistemically* to suspend judgment given her faulty gauge.  There is no single all-things-considered verdict.\n\nC.  Common-Currency Pragmatism.  All reasons for belief are ultimately practical: even evidence matters only because accurate beliefs serve our goals (e.g., knowledge is instrumentally valuable).  On this picture commensurability is secured, but at the cost of deflating epistemic normativity.\n\nD.  Hybrid Weighing.  Some philosophers (Weatherson, Rinard, Fantl & McGrath) propose to weigh accuracy and practical value directly, using expected-utility machinery familiar from decision theory.  But they owe an account of the cardinal scale that permits such addition without violating the distinctive authority of truth.\n\nEach of these solutions faces serious objections.  SEP struggles with apparent moral encroachment (\u201cdoxastic wronging\u201d) and with prudential cases such as Pascal\u2019s wager or self-efficacy beliefs that genuinely seem rational.  Distinct-Ought Pluralism leaves agents normatively fractured.  Pragmatism threatens to obliterate the sense in which believing falsely is a deficit even when no harm ensues.  Hybrid Weighing, finally, risks a crude utilitarianism about belief.\n\nThe Conditional Priority Model I advance borrows insights from each view while softening their weaknesses.\n\nII.  Constitutive Aims and Normative Sources\n\nBegin with a distinction between *object-level* and *agency-level* description of reasons.\n\nObject-level: A piece of evidence E indicates that p; its normative force is fixed wholly by that relation.  \nAgency-level: We deliberate about whether to adopt belief p given our total set of goals, some epistemic (accuracy, understanding), some practical (safety, solidarity, flourishing).\n\nTraditional epistemic normativity is object-level.  But in deliberation we occupy the agency-level standpoint: we must decide what doxastic attitude to take, all things considered.  Incommensurability arises only if we try to aggregate epistemic and practical reasons at the object-level, treating them as homogeneous tokens.  If instead we let epistemic and practical reasons remain categorically distinct yet recognise that the agent has *higher-order* reasons to care both about truth and about welfare, we have a vector space with two orthogonal dimensions.  A higher-order norm can assign default weightings to those dimensions without reducing one to the other.\n\nConsider the constitutive aim thesis: to be in the belief business at all is to be governed by a norm of accuracy.  (One may reject constitutivism; the model can be restated without it, but the thesis clarifies the source of lexical priority.)  Call the value of accuracy *Truth-Value* (TV).  Yet humans are not mere credal calculators; they are practical agents for whom beliefs are inputs to action, emotion, and relationship.  Hence there is also what Philip Kitcher (2021) calls a *pragmatic aim* of belief: to contribute to human flourishing.  Call that value *Practical-Value* (PV).  TV and PV are not reducible, but they can be ordered by a *default priority rule* embedded in our practice of responsible believing:\n\n(Priority) When PV considerations are ordinary (i.e., involving no catastrophic stakes), TV takes lexical priority.\n\nThe priority rule is justified in two complementary ways:\n\n1. Epistemic Autonomy: Recognising a belief as such requires seeing it as answerable to evidence (Lynch, 2009).  A person whose beliefs float free of evidence does not count as a believer but as a fantasist or fiction-maker.\n\n2. Social Division of Epistemic Labour: Communities need reliable transmitters of truth; if practical value routinely overrode evidence, testimonial trust would collapse (a point already implicit in Clifford).\n\nHowever, lexical priority cannot be absolute.  Suppose an oncologist has weak evidence (60% confidence) that an experimental drug will help her patient but also knows that the patient\u2019s only hope is to believe strongly that recovery is possible\u2014the placebo effect may increase survival odds dramatically.  The oncologist\u2019s *practical* reason to believe (and convey her belief) that the drug will work might, in this exceptional case, override the epistemic deficit.  That seems rational, not merely excusable.  So we need a mechanism by which PV can outweigh TV when the stakes are high enough.\n\nIII.  Modelling Override: The Threshold Strategy\n\nLet us model belief choice via an *Epistemic-Pragmatic Utility (EPU)* function:\n\nEPU(b) = w \u00b7 TV(b) + PV(b),\n\nwhere TV(b) is the expected truth accuracy of belief b, PV(b) its expected practical value, and w > 0 a weight capturing the agent\u2019s intrinsic valuation of truth.\n\nTo honour lexical priority we set w normally at a very large value compared with the scale on which PV is measured; but w is not infinite.  The bigger the practical stakes, the more PV can rise to offset even a moderate loss in TV.  In ordinary contexts (buying milk, reading the news) PV differentials are trivial: the cost of a false belief about last week\u2019s football score is negligible.  TV thus dominates.  In extraordinary contexts (life-or-death morale, incorrigible prejudice, the afterlife wager) PV skyrockets; TV may be outweighed.\n\nThis threshold picture avoids crude cardinal commensuration.  We do not require a single natural unit for truth and value; we need only a comparative relation expressing \u201cworth sacrificing this increment of accuracy for that increment of welfare.\u201d  Agents possess such comparative preferences, evidenced by their readiness to rely on quick heuristics in emergencies (sacrificing accuracy for speed) or to pay high costs for painstaking investigation when the margin for error is tiny (aircraft design).\n\nOne might object that the model collapses into Common-Currency Pragmatism.  The reply is that TV remains *non-instrumental* in the utility function\u2014it is valued for its own sake, not merely for causal contributions to PV.  That is why w enters multiplicatively rather than deriving from PV.  A second objection is that the function is ad hoc unless we say how w is fixed.  Two answers: (i) *Constitutive*: Being an epistemic agent sets a normative floor such that w must exceed a minimum value if one\u2019s cognitive life is to count as belief-governed.  (ii) *Contextual*: Social roles (scientist, friend, parent) encode variable w\u2019s; a scientist\u2019s professional w is higher, which is why wishful belief is more culpable in the lab than at a child\u2019s bedside.\n\nIV.  Objections and Replies\n\n1. Deontic Disunity:  The Threshold Strategy still delivers conflicting prescriptions: \u201cepistemically, believe not-p; all-things-considered, believe p.\u201d  Is that stable?  Yes.  Consider moral cases: legally you may speak hateful speech, but morally you ought not.  Agents navigate layered normativities constantly without confusion.  What matters is transparent ordering: we know which norm trumps when they conflict.\n\n2.  Clifford\u2019s Accusation:  Clifford argued that any departure from evidence is culpable because it encourages bad epistemic habits.  The model answers that Clifford correctly notes a *systemic* PV of truth-responsiveness.  That systemic PV is built into w; hence only huge additional PV can outweigh it.  The oncologist case clears the bar; everyday superstitions do not.\n\n3.  Suspension Cases:  What about cases where evidence is ambiguous and practical stakes urge belief?  The model does not license wishful belief because suspension has the highest TV when confidence is low, and PV may often be served equally by adopting certain actions without adopting the belief (acting *as if*).  That option subtracts from PV(believe) the cost of potential embarrassment or self-deception, raising the threshold still further.\n\n4.  Doxastic Involuntarism:  \u201cWe cannot believe at will; talk of \u2018ought\u2019 is pointless.\u201d  Even granting involuntarism, we can ask what attitudes we *ought* to cultivate, what evidence to seek, what testimony to expose ourselves to, etc.  Furthermore, partial control (e.g., attention, imaginative framing) suffices for normativity\u2014as with emotions, which are also partly involuntary but subject to rational evaluation.\n\nV.  Examples Doing Work\n\nA.  The Bridge Engineer.  An engineer inspects an old bridge.  Evidence of corrosion suggests a 5% chance of collapse.  A busload of children must cross.  If the engineer believes the bridge is safe, she may let them cross; if she believes it unsafe, she blocks the route, delaying vital medical supplies.  The practical cost of a false *safe* belief is catastrophic; the cost of a false *unsafe* belief is a minor delay.  TV pulls towards suspension (insufficient evidence either way), PV strongly favours the cautious belief (unsafe).  Since PV is high and lines up with TV\u2019s uncertainty, the model endorses believing \u201cthe bridge is unsafe.\u201d  No paradox arises.\n\nB.  Religious Consolation.  A grieving parent finds profound solace in believing she will see her child again.  Epistemic evidence is ambiguous; PV is immense.  Is belief rational?  The model asks how high w is for the parent in the given context.  Suppose w is high (she values truth deeply) and the social cost of delusion is medium.  PV may not suffice to cross the threshold; suspension or hope, rather than outright belief, remains rational.  The upshot vindicates many people\u2019s ambivalence about religious faith: they may *hope* rather than *believe*.\n\nC.  Stereotype Correction.  You suspect, on slim evidence, that a promising student might underperform.  Historical injustice gives a powerful practical reason *not* to believe the stereotype.  Because false negative expectations can sabotage performance (stereotype threat), the PV of suspending belief is high.  Importantly, TV does not clearly lean the other way\u2014your evidence is weak.  The model therefore supports suspension, aligning with recent work on \u201cmoral encroachment\u201d without granting that morality directly changes evidential thresholds.  It is the *all-things-considered* inquiry that favours suspension.\n\nVI.  Advantages over Rivals\n\n1.  Over SEP: Explains rational permissibility of some pragmatic beliefs without denying reality of epistemic normativity.\n\n2.  Over Distinct-Ought: Provides a single deliberative verdict when needed for action; preserves agents\u2019 integrity.\n\n3.  Over Common-Currency: Retains the sui generis value of accuracy, thus accommodating the intuition that *even harmless falsehoods* are epistemically defective.\n\n4.  Over Crude Hybrid Weighing: Avoids proliferation of arbitrary utility tradeoffs by embedding a default lexical priority and context-sensitive threshold.\n\nVII.  Metanormative Payoff\n\nThe Conditional Priority Model suggests a broader lesson: apparent incommensurability often stems from category mistakes about *where* commensuration must occur.  Truth-conduciveness and welfare are heterogeneous properties of propositions, but deliberation happens at the level of agency, where reasons of different kinds become comparable because the agent must adopt a single course\u2014believe, disbelieve, or suspend.  Practical rationality is the crucible in which distinct normative metals can be alloyed, not by reducing them to a common essence but by fixing a practical order of authority.\n\nThis resonates with John Broome\u2019s \u201cnormative requirement\u201d view, on which rationality consists in conforming one\u2019s attitudes to higher-order relations among them.  It also echoes Aristotle\u2019s phronesis: the virtuous agent discerns the *right* mean, sensitive to the salience of goods in each situation.  What modern decision theory adds is simply a formal language for thresholds.\n\nVIII.  Concluding Synthesis\n\nWe began with a worry: epistemic and practical reasons seem incommensurable, so how could they jointly determine what one ought to believe?  The Conditional Priority Model answers:\n\n1.  They need not be weighed as homogeneous tokens; they are evaluated via the agent\u2019s higher-order standard that accords default lexical priority to truth.\n\n2.  Practical reasons override only when the pragmatic stakes exceed a robust but finite threshold, fixed by the constitutive and social importance we place on accuracy.\n\n3.  Decision-theoretic representation clarifies, but does not reduce, the distinctive authority of epistemic reasons.\n\nFar from being an impossible marriage, epistemic and practical reasons form a hierarchical partnership: truth normally leads, but value can take the wheel on rare, momentous occasions.  Such a division of normative labour fits both our reflective intuitions and our lived practices.  And it resolves the spectre of incommensurability by showing that the locus of comparison is not the reasons themselves but the agent who must shoulder them.", "output_tokens": 3942, "reasoning_tokens": 512}

Introduction and Statement of Thesis  \n\nThe question presupposes three claims many philosophers accept yet find hard to reconcile.  \n\n(i) Epistemic reasons\u2014features such as evidential support, explanatory power, and reliability\u2014bear on what one ought to believe because they track the aim of belief: truth.  \n(ii) Practical reasons\u2014features such as moral stakes, prudential usefulness, or social harm\u2014also appear to bear on what one ought to believe; William James\u2019s \u201cwill to believe,\u201d Pascalian wager cases, or high-stakes pragmatic encroachment all suggest that sometimes usefulness matters.  \n(iii) Epistemic and practical reasons differ in kind, so there seems to be no common currency for balancing them.  \n\nI shall defend the following thesis:  \n\nA person\u2019s all-things-considered (ATO) doxastic \u2018ought\u2019 is governed by a two-tier normative structure. Epistemic reasons have lexical priority, in that practical considerations are normatively inert until a sufficiently high epistemic threshold has been met\u2014roughly, until the evidential state makes the relevant proposition doxastically permissible. Once that threshold is reached, practical reasons may tilt the balance among the epistemically permissible options. Where the threshold is unmet, practical reasons can influence only indirect policies (e.g., inquiry management) but cannot directly justify belief.  \n\nThis threshold-lexical model yields interaction without commensuration: practical reasons never compete head-to-head with evidential support; they speak only after the evidential bar of permissibility is cleared. The picture combines insights from James, Clifford, Raz\u2019s exclusionary-reasons framework, and recent work on epistemic permissivism and pragmatic encroachment, yet it departs from each by introducing a specific threshold mechanism that explains and limits practical influence.\n\nThe argument proceeds in six stages: (2) clarifying the varieties of \u2018ought\u2019; (3) diagnosing the incommensurability worry; (4) developing the threshold-lexical model; (5) replying to four major objections; (6) showing how the model illuminates familiar cases; and (7) briefly indicating implications for epistemic norms and social epistemology.\n\n2. Two Senses of \u2018Ought\u2019 Governing Belief  \n\nPhilosophers routinely conflate three distinct uses of \u2018ought\u2019:\n\nEpistemic ought (E-ought): the standard of truth-conduciveness. One E-ought to believe p just in case p is sufficiently supported by her evidence.  \nPractical or pragmatic ought (P-ought): the standard of value or utility. One P-ought to believe p if believing p maximizes expected practical value (prudential, moral, or otherwise).  \nAll-things-considered doxastic ought (ATO-ought): the unique normative verdict that integrates all pro-belief reasons, whatever their source.\n\nStatements of the form \u201cyou ought to believe climate change is anthropogenic\u201d are often ambiguous between E-ought (what your evidence says) and P-ought (because acting on that belief averts catastrophe). The explanatory challenge concerns ATO-ought: how do E-reasons and P-reasons combine to yield one net directive?\n\n3. Why Incommensurability Looks Inevitable  \n\nThree arguments for incommensurability seem especially forceful.\n\n3.1 Different Aims Argument. Belief aims at truth; practical rationality aims (inter alia) at welfare. Because the constitutive aim of belief is truth, the standards governing it must be exclusively epistemic; to weigh usefulness against truth is to replace the activity with something else (acceptance, make-believe).  \n\n3.2 Value-Type Argument. Epistemic reasons are alethic goods, practical reasons are prudential/moral goods, and there is no single scale relating the two. You cannot sensibly add \u20183 units of probability\u2019 to \u20185 units of expected utility\u2019.  \n\n3.3 Doxastic Deliberation Argument. When one asks oneself whether p, one can respond only to considerations bearing on p\u2019s truth. A pragmatic consideration like \u201cbelieving p will keep me healthy\u201d is motivationally inert within the distinctive phenomenology of belief-formation.\n\nThe upshot appears to be stalemate: either practical reasons are screened off (purism) or they swamp epistemic ones (radical pragmatism); no stable mixed view seems coherent.\n\n4. The Threshold-Lexical Model  \n\n4.1 Two Normatively Distinct Phases  \n\nThe key move is to notice that \u2018what to believe\u2019 is decided in two temporally and normatively distinct phases:\n\nPhase 1 \u2013 Permissibility determination. What beliefs are epistemically permissible given my evidence? Here only E-reasons have normative force.\n\nPhase 2 \u2013 Optionality resolution. Among the permissible options (believe p, suspend, believe \u00acp), which should I adopt? Here, if multiple options remain permissible, practical reasons can legitimately tip the scale.\n\nThus practical considerations never trade off against evidential support; they operate only when the evidential hurdle is cleared. We thereby secure a form of interaction (practical reasons can indeed matter) without commensuration (they never go toe-to-toe with evidence).\n\n4.2 The Threshold  \n\nHow strong must evidence be to make a doxastic attitude epistemically permissible? The model allows context-sensitive thresholds, but a natural default is the \u201cpreponderance\u201d level: credence > .5 for belief, < .5 for disbelief, and = .5 for suspension. More sophisticated versions could appeal to safety or knowledge thresholds. Crucially, the threshold must be fixed independently of practical stakes, or lexical priority collapses.\n\n4.3 Why Lexical, Not Merely Weighted  \n\nCould we instead assign cardinal values to truth and welfare and maximize the sum? That returns us to incommensurability worries. By giving epistemic reasons lexical priority, we honor the constitutive aim of belief: one cannot, within the practice of belief, settle for a claim one takes to be under-evidenced merely because it is convenient. Practical reasons then play only a tie-breaking or option-selecting role.\n\n4.4 Razian Exclusionary Structure  \n\nThe model can be recast in the idiom of exclusionary reasons. Epistemic reasons generate first-order reasons for belief and, at the same time, a second-order exclusionary reason disabling the consideration of practical factors unless the first-order balance yields permissibility. Once the exclusionary reason is lifted (threshold met), practical reasons regain normative force.\n\n5. Replies to Four Objections  \n\nObjection 1: High-stakes pragmatic encroachment shows that practical stakes raise the evidential bar itself (e.g., you need more evidence to know the bank will be open if the payoff of error is high).  \n\nReply: Pragmatic encroachment concerns knowledge, not permissibility of outright belief. Even if knowledge is stake-sensitive, belief permissibility can remain stake-insensitive. Alternatively, one might fold encroachment into the model by allowing the threshold to vary with stakes\u2014but then lexical priority is lost. I argue that keeping belief permissibility stake-insensitive better preserves the distinctive nature of doxastic attitudes.\n\nObjection 2: The model still permits morally disastrous beliefs, provided minimal evidence supports them. Suppose a racist has weak but non-negligible evidence for a repugnant claim; if believing would cause harm, shouldn\u2019t practical reasons forbid belief?  \n\nReply: Two answers. First, \u2018weak but non-negligible\u2019 evidence will seldom cross even a modest threshold once contrary public evidence is counted. Second, the model leaves room for a higher-order moral requirement governing inquiry: the racist ought to seek further evidence, precisely because acting on a barely permissible belief would risk harm. Failure of epistemic due diligence, not the lexical order, is the culprit.\n\nObjection 3: The phenomenology of doxastic deliberation excludes practical considerations entirely; they cannot function even as tie-breakers because belief just is the attitude you take when evidence persuades you.  \n\nReply: Cases of evidential equipoise show otherwise. Imagine two rival scientific theories equally supported by current data. A researcher may adopt one rather than suspend, perhaps because funding agencies require a commitment to secure a grant. Phenomenologically, she is aware that either option is epistemically fine, yet practical utility selects one. So tie-breaking does occur in genuine doxastic settings.\n\nObjection 4: The view collapses into evidentialism because practical reasons rarely operate\u2014the space of true ties is too narrow.  \n\nReply: (a) Science, law, and everyday life abound with underdetermination. (b) Suspension itself is an epistemically permissible option; practical reasons can urge confident belief rather than suspension (e.g., the doctor who must decide on a diagnosis under uncertain evidence). So practical influence is neither trivial nor rare.\n\n6. Case Studies  \n\n6.1 Pascal\u2019s Wager  \n\nPascal urges belief in God on prudential grounds alone. On the threshold-lexical model, since Pascal concedes that the evidence for God is indecisive, belief is not yet permissible; practical reasons cannot justify theistic belief. What they can justify is a policy of cultivating evidence-gathering practices (e.g., church attendance) likely to raise epistemic confidence. The classic discomfort with Pascal thus receives principled explanation: he violates lexical priority.\n\n6.2 William James\u2019s Sick Mountain Climber  \n\nJames imagines a climber whose chance of succeeding is enhanced by believing he will succeed. If available evidence makes success slightly more probable than failure, belief crosses the threshold; epistemically, both belief and suspension may be permissible. Practical reasons (survival) now kick in and make belief ATO-required. The climber\u2019s \u201cfaith\u201d is vindicated, but only because the evidential bar is cleared.\n\n6.3 The Psychologically Fragile Patient  \n\nSuppose a doctor hesitates to disclose a grim but uncertain prognosis because the patient\u2019s health depends on optimism. If the doctor\u2019s evidence only weakly supports the negative prognosis, suspension lies within the permissible range. Practical reasons (patient welfare) can then justify withholding belief in the dire outcome. Again, no direct trade-off is needed.\n\n6.4 Gettier, Lottery, and Thresholds  \n\nGettier cases show that justified true belief may fall short of knowledge. Our model handles this by recognizing that the epistemic threshold for permissibility is lower than that for knowledge. Practical reasons can interact with beliefs that are justified but not known; they cannot salvage outright unjustified beliefs.\n\n7. Broader Implications  \n\n7.1 Permissivism Without Relativism  \n\nEpistemic permissivism\u2014the view that more than one belief can be rationally permissible on the same evidence\u2014gains a rationale: permissivism creates space for practical tie-breakers. Yet because the initial threshold is evidence-fixed, we avoid slipping into epistemic relativism.\n\n7.2 Doxastic Wronging and Social Epistemology  \n\nRecent debates on \u201cdoxastic wrongdoing\u201d hold that believing harmful stereotypes can wrong their targets. The threshold-lexical model locates such wrongs at two sites: (i) believing below the threshold (epistemic wrong), and (ii) failing to inquire further when practical stakes demand caution (practical wrong at the level of inquiry, not belief). The view thereby clarifies where social and moral critiques of belief properly apply.\n\n7.3 Partial Control of Belief  \n\nBecause direct voluntary control over belief is limited, practical reasons mainly operate indirectly: regulating evidence exposure, seeking further data, or managing doxastic habits. The model honors this psychological fact and explains why outright wishful thinking fails: direct belief contrary to evidence would breach the epistemic threshold.\n\n8. Conclusion  \n\nThe apparent incommensurability of epistemic and practical reasons for belief dissolves once we recognize a two-tier normative structure with a non-negotiable evidential threshold. Epistemic reasons set the domain of permissible belief; practical reasons select within that domain when multiplicity remains. This threshold-lexical architecture respects the constitutive aim of belief, secures room for pragmatic considerations where they are intuitively appropriate, and avoids the pitfalls of both purist evidentialism and unbridled pragmatism. Though further work is needed to specify thresholds across contexts, the model provides a principled framework for understanding how truth and value jointly govern doxastic life.", "output_tokens": 3043, "reasoning_tokens": 384}

When a single doxastic choice is apparently pulled in both directions, we seem forced to ask an impossible question: how many units of truth-conduciveness equal one unit of utility or one violation of another\u2019s rights?  The specter of incommensurability has led many philosophers either to deny that practical considerations ever really count as reasons for belief (epistemic purism) or to concede that they count but only in a separate ledger that never gets summed with the epistemic one (two-ought views).  I will argue for a third option: a unified, all-things-considered (ATC) \u201ccommon-currency\u201d model on which epistemic and practical considerations are indeed comparable, though the comparison is context-sensitive, structured, and often lexically ordered.  Truth is not the only value that beliefs realize; it is, however, normally the dominant one.  In extreme circumstances\u2014where practical stakes are high enough\u2014practical reasons can outweigh epistemic reasons, and they can do so without reducing the practice of belief formation to wishful thinking.  Far from being incoherent, this view explains everyday normative judgments, integrates with decision-theoretic work in epistemic utility theory, and handles the standard objections more gracefully than its rivals.\n\n1.  Setting Up the Puzzle\n\nTake Morally Troubled Doctor.  A physician learns, from highly reliable evidence, that a contagious disease is not airborne but exclusively blood-borne.  She also knows that if she publicizes this conclusion immediately, thousands of frightened citizens will prematurely flee the quarantine zone, spreading the disease farther and likely killing tens of thousands.  Her moral conscience counsels silence or even, temporarily, belief in the airborne hypothesis.  What ought she believe about the mode of transmission?\n\nIntuitively, two different kinds of considerations are at play:\n\nEpistemic: The evidence strongly supports blood-borne transmission; believing otherwise would be false or at least less likely to be true.\n\nPractical: Believing (and saying) that the disease is airborne would avert catastrophe.\n\nHow, if at all, can these be weighed together?  That is the central question.\n\n2.  Rejecting Two Familiar Escapes\n\n2.1  Epistemic Purism  \nPurists (e.g., Owens 2000; Shah 2006) insist that only truth-related factors are genuine reasons for belief.  The doctor epistemically ought to believe what her evidence indicates.  Period.  Purism protects a certain conception of the \u201cepistemic enterprise,\u201d but at the cost of re-describing commonplace moral talk\u2014\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t believe that conspiracy theory; it\u2019s dangerous\u201d\u2014as really about asserting or acting, never about believing.  Worse, purism forces a deep discontinuity between doxastic and practical normativity.  Reasons can interact seamlessly in action (prudential, moral, aesthetic), but in belief we postulate a mysterious firewall.  Explaining why belief is unique requires more than stipulation.\n\n2.2  Two-Ought (Dual Ledger) Views  \nAlternately, one can maintain that there are two autonomous \u2018ought\u2019s: an epistemic ought entirely fixed by evidence and a practical ought fixed by stakes (Feldman 2000; Gibbons 2013).  The doctor epistemically ought to believe the truth and practically ought not to, with no fact of the matter about what she simply ought (all things considered) to believe.  Yet decisions must ultimately be made.  A single doxastic act will occur; she either believes or withholds.  A theory that refuses to say which single attitude is fitting leaves the normative space fractured right where we need guidance most.\n\n3.  Toward a Common Currency\n\nThe alternative is to treat epistemic and practical reasons as items of the same genus: considerations that count in favor of adopting a cognitive attitude.  They differ in their *grounds*\u2014truth versus welfare\u2014but share a *normative role*: providing weight toward believing.  What makes commensurability possible is that reasons are individuated by their directional force, not by their content domain.  Compare action: that a promise was made (moral) and that fine wine awaits (prudential) can both bear on whether to dine with a friend.  Few conclude that such reasons are incommensurable in principle.  Why should belief be stranger?\n\n3.1  The Metaphysics of Weight  \nOn a reasons-first picture (Parfit 2011; Scanlon 1998), \u201cweight\u201d is a primitive normative property: *A\u2019s being the case counts for x units in favor of \u03c6-ing.*  We do not demand a further measure.  In decision contexts we often introduce numbers for clarity, but the comparability is there before any cardinalization.  Likewise, the doctor\u2019s evidence might be said loosely to carry \u201cvery great\u201d\u2014perhaps not infinite\u2014epistemic weight; the catastrophic public-health consequences carry \u201cenormous\u201d practical weight.  The important point is that the comparative relations (\u201coutweighs,\u201d \u201cis trumped by\u201d) are intelligible even if not exactly measurable.\n\n3.2  Decision-Theoretic Support  \nEpistemic utility theory bolsters this metaphysical sketch.  Joyce (1998) and Leitgeb & Pettigrew (2010) show that standard accuracy measures like Brier score or log-score vindicate probabilism: believing in proportion to evidence maximizes expected epistemic utility.  Nothing prevents extending the utility function to include non-accuracy components such as moral consequences.  Indeed, Greaves & Wallace\u2019s \u201cexpectationalism\u201d about *axiological* as well as *epistemic* value makes rendering them comparable straightforward: the agent\u2019s total utility = \u03b1\u00b7(expected accuracy) + \u03b2\u00b7(expected moral/prudential benefit).  \u03b1 and \u03b2 are weighting parameters, normally heavily skewed toward accuracy but perhaps not lexically so.  The theory need not pretend agents literally perform these calculations; it suffices that choice dispositions can be represented *as if* they respect such a ranking.\n\n4.  Lexical Dominance Rather Than Infinite Value\n\nA common objection is that truth has unlimited worth; to trade it for utility is to license wishful thinking.  Yet our practice belies this absolutism.  We routinely treat secrecy and promise-keeping as moral reasons to withhold certain true beliefs, and we often judge agnosticism permissible when investigation would be ruinous or vulgar.  Still, there is something right in the absolutist intuition: truth is the central telos of belief.  The best way to capture both thoughts is to posit *lexical dominance*, not infinite value.  Lexical ordering says: move to practical considerations only when epistemic ones reach a plateau of near-indifference (e.g., under evidential tie or minimal evidential tilt).  Most everyday cases never reach that stage; hence, evidence reigns.  But in high-stakes outlier scenarios\u2014religious martyrs facing torture, the colonel transmitting a false code to mislead enemy spies\u2014practical stakes can legitimately override.\n\n5.  Replying to Four Standard Objections\n\nObjection 1:  Doxastic Involuntarism  \n\u201cBeliefs aren\u2019t under voluntary control; practical reasons cannot rationally necessitate what you cannot choose.\u201d  But what matters for normative assessment is not direct voluntary control but *responsiveness to reasons*.  We lack direct control over sneezes, yet we can be asked to stifle them in a library.  Control is indirect, via prior planning or attention management.  Likewise, we influence our future beliefs through information exposure, selective attention, and evidential search.  Practical reasons guide these diachronic strategies, and that suffices for them to be genuine reasons.\n\nObjection 2:  Transparency  \nShoemaker (1994) observes that sincere deliberation about whether to believe p collapses into deliberation about p\u2019s truth.  How, then, could one deliberate about whether it would be *useful* to believe p?  The answer is two-level.  At the *moment* of belief formation, one\u2019s attention is indeed captured by considerations bearing on truth.  But the *prior* deliberation that sets up which evidence one will look at or how strictly one will demand evidential thresholds can and often does incorporate pragmatic factors.  Pragmatic encroachment effects (Stanley 2005; Fantl & McGrath 2009) exemplify this structure.\n\nObjection 3:  Evidence-Responsiveness as Constitutive of Belief  \nPurists often claim that believing just is the attitude that aims at truth; to pollute its regulation with pragmatic factors is to change the subject to acceptance or make-believe.  Yet aiming at truth is consistent with allowing auxiliary aims when truth and value conflict.  The archer\u2019s form is constituted by targeting the center, but in a crowded field she may intentionally miss to avoid harm.  She is still shooting arrows, still guided by the constitutive standard, but not enslaved to it in every circumstance.\n\nObjection 4:  Slippery Slope to Wishful Thinking  \nIf some practical reasons count, why not always believe whatever makes us happiest?  Because most practical contexts do not supply reasons strong enough to outweigh even mediocre evidence.  Furthermore, wishful beliefs quickly undermine their own practical value once confronted with recalcitrant reality.  The common-currency model predicts this: when the expected disutility of error is high (as it usually is), epistemic reasons regain dominance.\n\n6.  The Doctor Again\n\nLet us apply the framework.  The doctor\u2019s high-quality evidence supplies enormous epistemic weight.  The expected moral catastrophe, however, is even more enormous\u2014tens of thousands of innocent deaths.  Suppose the doctor can, by delaying her belief or by maintaining public agnosticism for 48 hours, allow containment to take effect.  The practical reason\u2019s weight plausibly eclipses the epistemic reason\u2019s, at least for that window.  After the delay, once evacuation no longer threatens, the practical reason evaporates and epistemic dominance resumes.  The theory thus yields the nuanced verdict we want: temporarily withhold or disguise belief for grave moral reasons, then believe according to evidence.  Neither purism nor dual-ledger views can deliver this dynamically integrated guidance.\n\n7.  Non-Ideal Comparisons and Indeterminacy\n\nThe model does not pretend to solve every case.  Some comparisons produce intransitivity or vagueness.  But this is a feature, not a bug.  Normative life is sometimes indecisive.  The incommensurability worry derives from mistakenly inferring from occasional imprecision to principled incomparability.  The common-currency view allows that some cases will be indeterminate, just as in ethics we confront hard moral dilemmas without concluding that moral and prudential reasons operate in alien currencies.\n\n8.  Broader Payoffs\n\n8.1  Explaining Pragmatic Encroachment  \nIf practical stakes can affect whether one *knows*, it is natural that they can affect whether one ought to believe.  The common-currency view unifies doxastic normativity with recent accounts of knowledge as interest-relative.\n\n8.2  Connecting to Social Epistemology  \nGroup epistemic norms (e.g., scientific consensus rules) explicitly balance accuracy against the social costs of error.  A theory that forbids such trade-offs would misdescribe scientific practice.  The common-currency approach aligns individual and collective levels.\n\n8.3  Moral Encroachment in Belief  \nDebates about morally charged statistical generalizations (\u201cStereotype Beliefs\u201d) hinge on whether moral reasons can defeat evidence.  My view vindicates the moderate position: yes, moral stakes can be weighty enough, but only under stringent conditions (high potential for harm, low evidential differential).\n\n9.  Comparison with Sui Generis Truth-Value Hybrid Theories\n\nParticularists like Weatherson (2005) propose that there are multiple epistemic goods\u2014truth, understanding, wisdom\u2014that cannot be reduced to a single scale.  I agree but hold that multidimensional value still allows comparison via dominance, lexicographic ordering, or thresholding.  The mathematical formalism of *vector utilities* suffices: belief A is better than belief B if it is at least as good in every dimension and strictly better in one, or when trade-off coefficients are contextually justified.\n\n10.  A New Distinction: Direct vs. Indirect Practical Reasons\n\nTo clarify the dialectic, introduce a distinction often missed:\n\nDirect practical reasons: reasons whose content directly recommends the belief itself because having the belief produces value (e.g., placebo effect).\n\nIndirect practical reasons: reasons to manipulate upstream processes (search, attention, exposure) so that later beliefs will be epistemically better.  \n\nThe common-currency model accommodates both, but their normative profiles differ: direct reasons must be weighty indeed to override truth; indirect reasons need only modest weight because they promote truth in the long run.  Recognizing this distinction dissolves many apparent counterexamples.\n\n11.  Summing Up\n\nWe face a menu:\n\nA.  Purism: denies practical reasons; implausibly stovepipes normativity.  \nB.  Dual-Ought: admits both but refuses integration; abdicates guidance.  \nC.  Common Currency: treats all reasons as comparable though not always precisely commensurable; truth normally lexically prior, but practical stakes can override in extremis.\n\nOption C best respects ordinary practice, harmonizes with decision theory, and defuses the incommensurability worry.  Epistemic and practical reasons interact because they inhabit a shared normative space structured by weight.  The weights need not be measurable on a single cardinal scale; it suffices that their comparative orderings be well-founded enough to guide action and self-regulation.\n\n12.  Coda: Implications for Future Research\n\nThe common-currency view invites two lines of inquiry.\n\nFirst, empirical: How do real people integrate epistemic and practical considerations?  Cognitive science can test whether motivational and evidential factors combine additively, lexically, or via threshold effects.  Finding the psychological mechanisms would inform normative fine-tuning.\n\nSecond, theoretical: What determines the default \u03b1/\u03b2 weighting between accuracy and other values?  One promising hypothesis is that these parameters are socially constructed: communities calibrate them through cultural evolution, sanctioning epistemically reckless but practically beneficial credences and vice versa.  Investigating this could bridge virtue epistemology and social choice theory.\n\nIf these projects bear fruit, the allegedly impossible task of balancing truth and value in belief will turn out not to be incoherent but instead a sophisticated, context-sensitive art\u2014one we already practice, and one philosophy can help us practice better.", "output_tokens": 3937, "reasoning_tokens": 768}

On the one hand, believing is a paradigmatically truth-directed attitude: to believe that p is (normally) to take p to be true, and epistemic reasons are, by their nature, considerations that bear on the truth of p.  On the other hand, to be a believer is also to be an agent whose beliefs guide action and affect others, sometimes for good, sometimes for ill.  Those downstream consequences generate practical or moral reasons that appear, at least in principle, to pull in directions independent of (and occasionally opposed to) truth.  How, if at all, can such heterogeneous considerations be aggregated into a single \u201call-things-considered\u201d verdict about what one ought to believe?\n\nI shall defend a two-tier, \u201cpermissive-hierarchical\u201d picture:\n\n1. Epistemic reasons enjoy lexical priority: they unilaterally determine whether it is epistemically obligatory, forbidden, or merely permissible to believe p.  \n2. When the epistemic verdict falls into the \u201cpermissible\u201d range\u2014when the evidence neither requires nor excludes belief\u2014practical reasons may legitimately break the tie.  \n3. Because practical reasons get a voice only where epistemic permissiveness obtains, the worry about weighing incommensurable currencies is defused; the two kinds of reasons never have to be balanced on the same scale.  They enter sequentially, not simultaneously.\n\nI shall argue that this model fits our best thinking about the nature of belief, makes room for familiar Jamesian and pragmatic intuitions, and handles some thorny counter-examples better than its main rivals (pure epistemicism, pragmatic encroachment, and full-blown aggregationism).  The discussion proceeds in six stages:\n\nI.\tClarifying the Target Question  \nII.\tFour Families of Responses and Their Shortcomings  \nIII.\tThe Case for Lexical Epistemic Priority  \nIV.\tThe Necessity (and Limits) of Epistemic Permissivism  \nV.\tHow Practical Reasons Operate Within the Permissive Zone  \nVI.\tObjections and Replies\n\nI. Clarifying the Target Question\n\n\u201cWhat ought I to believe?\u201d is ambiguous.  We should distinguish:\n\nA.\tThe epistemic ought (OE): the ought of truth-seeking or accuracy.  \nB.\tThe practical ought (OP): the ought of action, value, or morality.  \nC.\tThe overall ought (OA): the verdict that tells an agent, simpliciter, whether to adopt attitude A toward p.\n\nMost of the intuitive puzzles arise because we tacitly presuppose that there is a unitary OA that somehow synthesises OE and OP.  Incommensurability anxiety is therefore anxiety about the synthetic step: how, given their different natures, could OE and OP feed into a single OA?\n\nNotice, however, that almost everyone agrees on the following:\n\n1.\tIf believing p is epistemically mandatory (evidence makes \u00acp irrational), no practical consideration can make it overall rational to suspend or to disbelieve.  (If I have conclusive evidence that the bridge is unsafe, no amount of economic benefit from its continued use can make it reasonable for me to believe otherwise.)  \n2.\tIf believing p is epistemically forbidden (evidence decisively supports \u00acp), practical considerations cannot make it overall reasonable to believe p.\n\nSo the real battleground is the \u201cindeterminate middle\u201d\u2014cases in which the evidence neither decisively supports p nor decisively supports \u00acp.  It is here that William James\u2019s ethics of belief, Pascalian wagering, and high-stakes pragmatic encroachment are typically invoked.  The two-tier account I shall develop acknowledges that this middle region exists and is philosophically important; indeed, practical reasons get their hearing precisely there.  But outside that region, epistemic reasons reign supreme.\n\nII. Four Families of Responses and Their Shortcomings\n\n1. Pure Epistemicism: Only epistemic reasons ever bear on belief; talk of \u201cpractical reasons for belief\u201d is a category mistake.  \n   Objection: This view cannot explain our intuitive approval of certain belief choices under grave risk or profound moral pressure.  The terminal cancer patient who chooses to believe she will recover, thereby rallying medically crucial optimism, seems rational in a perfectly ordinary sense.  Denying that her practical reasons count at all looks unduly purist.\n\n2. Full Aggregationism: Both sorts of reasons share a single normative common currency (e.g. expected utility), so they can be weighed directly.  \n   Objection: The very idea that \u201ctruth-points\u201d and \u201cutility-points\u201d can be put on the same scale is implausible.  Moreover, aggregationism predicts that possessing overwhelming evidence can be overridden by sufficiently large practical stakes, a prediction most find unacceptable.\n\n3. Pragmatic Encroachment: Practical stakes modulate the strength or amount of evidence required for knowledge or justified belief; thus practical considerations affect belief indirectly by redefining epistemic thresholds.  \n   Objection: While elegant, encroachment threatens a category conflation: if \u201chow much evidence is required\u201d varies with the utility of being right, we have ceased to be discussing purely truth-directed standards.  Many epistemologists regard this as giving up what is distinctive about epistemic normativity.\n\n4. Dual Ought Pluralism: There is no OA; there are only OE and OP, and conflicts are brute.  \n   Objection: Ordinary deliberators need guidance; telling them only that \u201cepistemically you should believe p but prudentially you shouldn\u2019t\u201d without further advice leaves them in limbo.\n\nEach view captures something plausible\u2014the purity of truth, the pragmatic importance of consequences, the variable salience of stakes, and the reality of plural norms.  My proposal borrows from all four while avoiding their excesses.\n\nIII. The Case for Lexical Epistemic Priority\n\nBeliefs are, in an important sense, transparent to the truth.  When one wonders \u201cShould I believe p?\u201d, the rational way to answer is by asking \u201cIs p true (or probably true)?\u201d  Deciding by inspection of non-truth considerations is a form of pragmatic self-manipulation, and that sits poorly with the constitutive aim of belief.\n\nBecause of this transparency phenomenon, epistemic norms have a strong claim to lexical priority: they directly govern the attitude in question.  Practical norms, though genuinely important, enter only indirectly\u2014by governing which doxastic states it is beneficial or harmful to occupy, not by governing the epistemic propriety of taking p as true.\n\nLexical priority vindicates two desiderata:\n\na)\tIt respects the internal connection between belief and truth, thus preserving the distinctive role of epistemic reasons.  \nb)\tIt still allows practical reasons to matter, provided they do not dictate belief against decisive evidence.\n\nIf lexical priority is granted, the remaining puzzle is: Where exactly does the line between decisiveness and permissiveness fall?  Enter the topic of epistemic permissivism.\n\nIV. The Necessity (and Limits) of Epistemic Permissivism\n\nEpistemic Uniqueness theorists hold that for any body of evidence E and proposition p, there is exactly one doxastic attitude toward p that is epistemically rational.  If Uniqueness were true, the permissive zone would vanish, leaving no room for practical reasons to do any tie-breaking.  But Uniqueness is, I think, untenable for two reasons.\n\n1.\tIncompleteness of Evidence: Normal empirical evidence underdetermines theory choice (consider under-constrained scientific models or ordinary perceptual disputes in poor lighting).  Different but equally conscientious reasoners may permissibly adopt different credences.  \n2.\tSymmetry Cases: Suppose my evidence is a purely statistical 0.5 chance for p.  An attitude of suspension, a tentative credence of 0.5, or even a cautious acceptance (if costs of falsity are minor) all seem epistemically okay.  To insist that only one of these is uniquely rational is to legislate standards more precise than our practice supports.\n\nAdopting a graded picture of epistemic rationality\u2014where attitudes can be required, forbidden, or merely allowed\u2014gives space for the \u201cpermissive zone\u201d that tier-two practical deliberation will occupy.\n\nV. How Practical Reasons Operate Within the Permissive Zone\n\nOnce the evidence delivers its verdict\u2014mandatory, forbidden, or permissible\u2014we ask: what next?  If permissible, the agent is free to let practical considerations settle the matter.  Two questions arise:\n\nA) Must the agent exercise that freedom?  \nB) How should practical reasons be evaluated?\n\nOn (A): No.  Permissibility is precisely the absence of epistemic imperative.  An agent may defer choice (suspend belief) or consult practical reasons as she sees fit.  There is no further \u201cought\u201d generated by epistemic norms.  But practical rationality may, of course, urge a stance; for example, medical policy may require a surgeon to assume worst-case scenarios when test results are inconclusive.\n\nOn (B): Here ordinary decision theory applies.  Practical reasons are already denominated in utilities, moral values, or welfare outcomes.  Within the permissive range, agents may weigh costs and benefits of being right or wrong about p.  Importantly, because epistemic standings have already been settled as permissible, no incommensurability arises: practical reasons are compared only with each other, not against epistemic reasons.\n\nExample 1 (Medical Diagnosis):  \nEvidence suggests a 40% probability of infection X but is indeterminate.  Believing \u201cX is present\u201d will prompt immediate antibiotics; disbelieving or suspending delays treatment.  Given high morbidity, practical reasons favour believing.  Since the evidence neither mandates nor prohibits belief, the physician rightly forms the belief and acts accordingly.\n\nExample 2 (Comforting Falsehood):  \nA parent\u2019s evidence indicates with 95% probability that the family dog has died.  The child is emotionally fragile, and believing \u201cthe dog is still alive\u201d would avert a traumatic breakdown.  Here the epistemic reasons are decisive: it is epistemically mandatory to believe the dog is dead.  Lexical priority blocks the practical inducement to adopt the comforting falsehood.  The parent may withhold the information or lie in speech, but she ought not form the contrary belief.\n\nNotice how the two-tier model straightforwardly adjudicates both cases without needing to place \u201ctruth-points\u201d on one side of a common scale.\n\nVI. Objections and Replies\n\nObjection 1: What about extremely high-stakes cases\u2014say, Pascal\u2019s Wager\u2014where practical benefits are infinite?  Doesn\u2019t lexical priority then look irrationally conservative?\n\nReply: The wager assumes epistemic permissiveness (uncertainty about God\u2019s existence).  If evidence cannot settle the question, practical reasons (infinite utility) may indeed rationally move one to believe.  Lexical priority is upheld; the permissiveness of the evidence is a precondition.  If the evidence were conclusively atheistic, the wager would not license belief.  Hence no counter-example.\n\nObjection 2: Doesn\u2019t pragmatic encroachment show that stakes affect not merely a second tier but the very thresholds of knowledge?  For instance, in low-stakes contexts I can say \u201cI know the bank is open Saturday,\u201d but not in high-stakes contexts.\n\nReply: The encroachment data can be reconstrued as linguistic rather than normative.  High stakes often raise conversational standards for asserting \u201cknows\u201d; they need not alter what epistemic reasons require.  What matters for our purposes is that, at the level of belief, encroachment phenomena can be captured by shifting from categorical belief to graded confidence.  A high-stakes agent may rationally retain the same credence but refrain from the categorical belief state because categorical belief is more dangerous.  That is a practical, second-tier consideration.\n\nObjection 3: Permissivism is controversial; what if Uniqueness is true?\n\nReply: If Uniqueness were true, then either epistemic reasons always mandate a precise credence (leaving no space for practical input) or mandate suspension whenever evidence is equivocal.  In the latter variant, practical reasons might re-enter indirectly via decision rules that map suspension to action.  Either way, incommensurability worries disappear because there is nothing left to be weighed.  So the two-tier model reduces to pure epistemicism under Uniqueness and is therefore strictly more general.\n\nObjection 4: Doesn\u2019t lexical priority ignore cases where believing truly would be morally monstrous?  Consider someone with conclusive evidence that a hidden refugee is in the attic, confronted by a murderous tyrant.\n\nReply: Here we must separate believing from telling.  The epistemic mandate is to believe the truth.  Morality governs what one may say or reveal.  Lying to the tyrant is permissible, even obligatory, but forming the opposite belief is not required and may be psychologically impossible.  If, ex hypothesi, the evidence is conclusive, epistemic norms fix belief.  Practical norms govern communicative action.\n\nObjection 5: Is the hierarchical model ad hoc?  Why should epistemic reasons get lexical priority rather than, say, moral reasons?\n\nReply: The proposal is not arbitrary; it is grounded in the constitutive nature of belief.  Belief is, to borrow Bernard Williams\u2019s phrase, \u201ctransparent to the truth.\u201d  While actions have mixed aims and admit of compromises, belief aims at truth non-derivatively.  If we called something \u201cbelief\u201d that could be directly chosen for non-truth reasons against the evidence, we would have changed the subject to something closer to wish-fulfilment or self-induced delusion.  Lexical priority thus honours a conceptual truth about what believing is.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe philosopher\u2019s impulse to aggregate all normative reasons into a single balance-sheet is understandable but, in this domain, misguided.  Belief is governed, first and foremost, by its epistemic telos.  Practical considerations do matter, yet they do so only when epistemic norms permit multiple permissible attitudes.  In such cases practical stakes legitimately break epistemic ties, and there is no need for a mysterious commensuration of truth and utility.  Rather than imagining an impossible common currency, we should recognise a temporal and normative division of labour: epistemic reasons speak first, and when they fall silent, practical reasons speak second.  The incommensurability problem dissolves once we notice that the two speeches never overlap.\n\nBy capturing what is right in Clifford\u2019s evidentialism (truth priority), James\u2019s pragmatism (the rational permissibility of letting practical stakes decide), and contemporary permissivism (the existence of epistemic slack), the two-tier hierarchical model offers a principled and ecumenical resolution.  It shows how epistemic and practical reasons can indeed \u201cinteract,\u201d not by being weighed together, but by entering the deliberative arena in sequence.  The structure is not a compromise but a stable marriage: each type of reason occupies the domain suited to its nature, and together they generate the nuanced verdicts about belief that our actual epistemic lives require.", "output_tokens": 3879, "reasoning_tokens": 640}

On the one hand it seems obvious that what one ought to believe is fixed by the evidence: if my best total evidence strongly supports that the earth orbits the sun, then, epistemically speaking, I ought to believe it, regardless of any consequences of doing so.  On the other hand, we routinely evaluate beliefs by appeal to non-epistemic considerations: we criticise the zealot who embraces a politically incendiary conspiracy theory because it \u201cgives his life meaning,\u201d or we praise the terminally ill patient who convinces herself that remission is just around the corner because the hope sustains her children.  These latter appraisals appeal to practical reasons\u2014reasons of welfare, morality, prudence, solidarity, or dignity.  The puzzle is that the two kinds of reasons appear to be radically different currencies.  Epistemic reasons track truth; practical reasons track value.  How, then, could a single, all-things-considered doxastic \u201cought\u201d possibly result from combining them?\n\nMy thesis is an answer in two parts.\n\n1.  Epistemic and practical reasons do not compete in a single balance-of-reasons marketplace.  They govern different normative questions, each of which issues in its own pro tanto verdict.  Epistemic reasons answer the question \u201cWhat is credible?\u201d, while practical reasons answer the question \u201cWhat, if any, doxastic attitude should I adopt, given my total interests and values, toward propositions whose credibility falls within a zone of evidential indeterminacy?\u201d  The two sets of reasons therefore interact sequentially rather than commensurately: evidence has lexical priority, but where it leaves matters indeterminate, practical reasons legitimately decide.\n\n2.  The resultant picture accommodates our intuitions better than both pure evidentialism (which cannot explain why hope is sometimes rational) and unqualified pragmatism (which collapses truth-conduciveness into just another instrumental good).  It also shows why the apparent incommensurability of the two reason-types is not an obstacle: the justificatory division of labour leaves nothing for them to commensurate about.\n\nI. Mapping the dialectical terrain\n\nThere are three classical strategies for resolving the puzzle.\n\na) Strict evidentialism: only epistemic reasons bear on belief.  Practical evaluations apply solely to the downstream effects of having the belief, not to the belief\u2019s rationality.  William Clifford\u2019s famous maxim \u201cit is wrong always, everywhere, and for anyone, to believe anything upon insufficient evidence\u201d is paradigmatic.\n\nb) Unitary pragmatism: practical reasons are fundamental, and epistemic reasons matter only derivatively, because truth is typically instrumentally useful.  Jamesian \u201cwill-to-believe\u201d arguments lie here.\n\nc) Pluralistic weighing: both reason-types matter and must somehow be balanced in a single ledger.  The difficulty is articulating a common scale without trivialising their differences.\n\nThe proposal I defend blends the first and third strategies while evading their pitfalls: evidence enjoys lexical priority, preserving the distinctively alethic character of epistemic normativity, but practical reasons remain normatively relevant once evidence runs out of resolving power.\n\nII. Distinguishing three normative questions\n\nWe typically run together three separate \u2018oughts\u2019:\n\n(1) Epistemic ought: Oe(S, p) \u2014 subject S epistemically ought to believe p.\n(2) Practical-doxastic ought: Op(S, p) \u2014 S practically ought to believe p (or refrain from believing p).\n(3) All-things-considered doxastic ought: Oa(S, p) \u2014 S ought, simpliciter, to believe p.\n\nThe first is sensitive exclusively to truth-conduciveness; the second to the subject\u2019s goals, values, and commitments; the third integrates the two.  My contention is that Oa is not obtained by arithmetic aggregation but by a lexical, two-tier decision procedure:\n\nStep 1 (Epistemic filter):\n   If S\u2019s total evidence makes p credible beyond a threshold T (strong evidential support), then Oa(S, p) = believe p.\n   If the evidence makes ~p credible beyond T, then Oa(S, p) = disbelieve p.\n   If evidence leaves p in the undecided middle zone (call it the Gap), proceed to Step 2.\n\nStep 2 (Practical selector):\n   Consult S\u2019s practical reasons.  They determine whether it is better (morally, prudentially, aesthetically, etc.) to believe, to disbelieve, or to suspend.\n\nBecause practical reasons are consulted only after the epistemic filter, they never override strong evidence.  Conversely, within the Gap, epistemic reasons are silent because they deliver no determinate verdict; practical reasons therefore govern.\n\nIII. Why lexical priority is not ad hoc\n\nWhy think the normative architecture should be tiered rather than scalar?  Three arguments:\n\n1. Constitutive aim argument.  On the widely accepted \u201cteleological normativity of belief\u201d thesis, belief constitutively aims at truth; a state that does not answer to truth is not a proper belief at all but wishful fancy.  This gives evidence an intrinsic, not merely instrumental, authority over belief formation.  Practical goals, by contrast, relate to belief only extrinsically, via the expected effects of having that belief.  Lexical priority honours the constitutive aim.\n\n2. Transparency phenomenon.  When we are asked \u201cWhy do you believe p?\u201d, it is natural to answer with our evidence (\u201cbecause I saw it with my own eyes\u201d) rather than our interests (\u201cbecause it comforts me\u201d).  The fact that questions about belief characteristically solicit evidential justifications suggests that evidence is the primary normative standard.\n\n3. Normative convergence under idealisation.  Suppose two agents share identical evidence but differ radically in practical stakes.  On a weighing model, what each ought to believe may differ.  Yet our intuitive judgments about, say, historical or mathematical claims do not vary with the believer\u2019s idiosyncratic utilities.  Lexical priority secures convergence: truth-directed reasons bind equally across contexts, while practical considerations decide only where evidence leaves rational slack.\n\nIV. How the sequential model resolves the incommensurability worry\n\nIncommensurability arises only if we insist that epistemic and practical reasons must be weighed directly.  Under the proposed sequencing, they never meet head-to-head.  Epistemic reasons either settle the matter, or else declare abstention, in which case practical reasons take over.  There is therefore no need for a common measure.\n\nThink of judicial procedure.  A criminal court first asks whether the prosecution has established guilt beyond reasonable doubt.  If yes, the verdict is \u201cguilty\u201d irrespective of the practical value of acquittal.  If no, the defendant is acquitted; the jury does not then weigh the social utility of incarceration versus release.  Similarly, the epistemic tribunal issues a verdict only if the evidential burden is met; otherwise it demurs, leaving room for practical legislatures to pass normative statutes.\n\nV. Illustrative examples\n\nExample 1: The calibrated oncologist (Gap + practical override).\nDr Lee must decide whether to tell her patient that an experimental therapy is likely to succeed.  The current trial data provide a 40 % success probability\u2014below the epistemic confidence threshold for outright belief.  Dr Lee knows that the patient\u2019s adherence to a gruelling regimen depends critically on hope.  Here the epistemic tribunal withholds judgment (evidence insufficient).  Practical reasons\u2014promoting the patient\u2019s welfare\u2014may permissibly tilt Dr Lee toward believing (and communicating) that the therapy will work.  She does not flout truth-aim because the evidential filter has rendered the proposition epistemically permissible though not mandated.\n\nExample 2: The climate sceptic (strong evidence blocks practical reasons).\nActivist Alana\u2019s political movement would benefit enormously were anthropogenic climate change a myth; donations soar whenever she casts doubt on the consensus.  Yet the scientific evidence is overwhelming.  Because the evidential threshold for disbelief is well exceeded, practical reasons never get a hearing.  Alana ought to believe the consensus, full stop.\n\nExample 3: Religious faith under underdetermination.\nHistorical evidence for theism vs. atheism, many argue, lands in the Gap\u2014neither side meets threshold T.  Practical reasons (Pascalian prudence, existential yearning, community identity) may therefore permissibly influence one\u2019s doxastic stance.  This explains the social acceptability of faith without licensing epistemic anarchy: faith is rationally optional, not obligatory, and it is constrained by the requirement that evidence does not decisively speak against it.\n\nVI. Replying to two major objections\n\nObjection 1: The arbitrariness of threshold T.  Why privilege a specific evidential cutoff?  First, some threshold is inevitable if beliefs are to be actionable.  Human cognitive systems operate on limited resources, and deliberation must eventually close.  Second, T need not be sharp; what matters is a broad \u201cdecisiveness region\u201d accepted by epistemology (e.g., knowledge-level justification).  The proposal is therefore compatible with contextualism or subject-sensitive thresholds.\n\nObjection 2: Practical encroachment arguments claim that practical stakes affect epistemic standards themselves (Fantl & McGrath, Jeremy Goodman, etc.).  Does lexical priority ignore this?  No.  Encroachment can be recast within the present framework: varying stakes tighten or loosen the threshold T.  But crucially, the epistemic verdict remains evidential\u2014only the level of support required for outright belief shifts.  Practical reasoning still does not get directly weighed against truth; it instead modulates how much evidence suffices.  Hence the architecture survives.\n\nVII. Comparison with rival integrative accounts\n\n1. Scalar consequentialism (belief as action maximising expected value) collapses epistemic reasons into the subset of utilities associated with having true beliefs.  That picture cannot explain why we regard a belief that is true only by luck as epistemically defective.  The sequential model, anchored in truth-conduciveness, accommodates this datum.\n\n2. Two-attitude views (e.g., Richard Foley\u2019s) suggest replacing belief with \u201cacceptance\u201d for pragmatic purposes.  My model keeps the ordinary category of belief but explains which sub-set of pragmatically useful acceptances can also qualify as beliefs, namely those not prohibited by evidence.\n\n3. Jamesian permissivism (\u201cright to believe on insufficient evidence if it yields vital benefits\u201d) lacks principled constraints.  By contrast, the lexical gap mechanism sharply delimits when and why pragmatic reasons can operate.\n\nVIII. Broader theoretical dividends\n\nA. Unifying epistemic norms with moral/legal norms.  Lexical ordering echoes \u201clexical priority\u201d in Rawlsian justice and emergency triage.  Normative domains often employ filters (e.g., basic rights trump cost-benefit analysis unless overriding emergency): our theory embeds doxastic norms within this familiar normative architecture.\n\nB. Explaining doxastic akrasia.  Someone who says \u201cI know the polling data, but I believe my team will win because I need to stay motivated\u201d exemplifies illicit override: evidence exceeded threshold yet was ignored.  Our model diagnoses the irrationality without rejecting the motivational rationale; what she ought to do is adopt a different attitude (hope, supposition) rather than belief.\n\nC. Mental health and permissibility.  Cognitive-behavioural therapy sometimes recommends adopting \u201cadaptive\u201d beliefs.  The model distinguishes therapeutic contexts where evidence about one\u2019s self-worth is ambiguous (Gap, so adaptive beliefs may be licit) from contexts where self-deception conflicts with clear evidence.\n\nIX. A residual worry: does the picture fragment \u2018ought\u2019?\n\nOne might fear relativistic slide: if epistemic and practical oughts apply sequentially, are we left with a merely context-sensitive, piecemeal normativity rather than an integrated rational ideal?  Not so.  The all-things-considered ought is unified by the procedure itself.  It is principled, publicly articulable, and generates convergent verdicts among ideal agents who share evidence and practical values.  The fragmentation charge sticks only if one antecedently assumes that integration must be done via additive aggregation.\n\nX. Closing reflections\n\nWe began with an apparent incommensurability: truth and utility seem to pull in orthogonal directions.  I have argued that the feeling of paradox arises from the tacit assumption that the only way multiple norm-sources can guide a single attitude is by being weighed in the same scale.  Once we appreciate that norms can be lexically ordered and sequentially applied, the paradox dissolves.  Epistemic reasons speak first; when they fall silent, practical reasons may speak.  Both contribute authentically, neither is reduced to the other, and no mysterious unit of value is needed to \u201cconvert\u201d truth into welfare.\n\nThe proposed division of normative labour preserves our deepest intuitions\u2014respect for evidence, moral concern for consequences, opprobrium for self-serving delusion, and admiration for hope in uncertainty\u2014while furnishing a crisp procedural story about how these considerations interact.  That, I submit, is how epistemic and practical reasons jointly determine what one ought to believe.", "output_tokens": 3355, "reasoning_tokens": 576}

A first-order epistemic \u201cought\u201d that is lexically prior: one oughtE to believe a proposition just when one\u2019s total evidence makes it more reasonable to believe than to withhold.  \n\n2. A second-order pragmatic \u201cought\u201d that is conditional on underdetermination: where the evidence leaves one permitted (though not required) either to believe or to suspend, practical reasons may tip the balance.  \n\n3. An all-things-considered \u201cought\u201d that simply combines the two by heeding the lexical priority of the epistemic ought and letting the pragmatic ought operate only in the residual space left open by epistemic permissibility.  \n\nBecause practical reasons never compete head-to-head with undefeated epistemic reasons, the alleged incommensurability problem dissolves: the two kinds of considerations are compared only after an ordering rule has sorted them into distinct deliberative moments. The resulting picture preserves the intuition that truth-conduciveness has a special normative authority while still leaving room for pragmatic considerations to make a genuine, rational difference to what one finally ought to believe.\n\nThe rest of the essay defends this view in six steps. (i) I motivate the incommensurability challenge. (ii) I argue that current solutions either collapse practical reasons into epistemic ones or artificially insulate them. (iii) I articulate the hierarchical model in more detail. (iv) I show how it handles standard problem cases\u2014Pascal\u2019s Wager, Clifford\u2019s shipowner, pragmatic encroachment bank cases, and moral encroachment examples. (v) I answer four objections. (vi) I close by situating the proposal in a broader account of responsible agency.\n\n1. The incommensurability challenge\n\nConsider two familiar vignettes.\n\nPascal. I have weak evidence concerning God\u2019s existence but enormous utility to gain if I believe and God exists\u2014and little to lose if God does not.\n\nClifford\u2019s Shipowner. A shipowner convinces himself, on wishful grounds, that his deteriorating vessel is seaworthy because postponing repairs would be profitable; disaster ensues.\n\nPascal makes it tempting to think practical reasons can sometimes override weak evidence; Clifford makes it tempting to deny that usefulness can ever license belief against evidence. The tension tempts us toward an \u201caggregate\u201d view: perhaps epistemic and practical reasons can simply be placed on a single scale, like different currencies converted at some mysterious rate. But that quickly looks hopeless. Truth-conducive weight and pragmatic value are not commensurable: \u201cone additional micromort avoided\u201d does not obviously translate into \u201cone tenth of a point increase in probability that p.\u201d If they cannot be common-measured, how could they be balanced?\n\n2. Existing strategies and their limits\n\nTwo families of responses dominate the literature.\n\nCollapse strategies. Some epistemic purists argue that so-called \u201cpractical\u201d reasons are covertly epistemic. For example, a high-stakes situation purportedly changes how much evidence one needs, because if the cost of error is high we should demand more evidence; but that is an evidential, not a pragmatic, difference (Lasonen-Aarnio 2019). Collapse preserves unity but at the price of ignoring genuine pragmatic phenomenology. When a doctor delays a statistically justified but risky diagnosis until a confirmatory scan arrives, her hesitation is partly about what is at stake for the patient, not merely about Bayesian conditionalization.\n\nInsulation strategies. Others concede distinct kinds of reasons but deny that they interact. According to \u201cdual-domain\u201d theorists, there is an epistemic ought and a practical ought, full stop; they never combine into an overall ought (Weatherson 2005). But then we face dilemmas: if the two oughts conflict, which ought governs deliberate reflection? Insulation gives us normative schizophrenia.\n\nThe hierarchical model aims to occupy a middle ground: genuine interaction without common-currency aggregation.\n\n3. A hierarchical model of doxastic normativity\n\n3.1 Lexical priority\n\nStart with an analogy from moral theory. Many deontologists, following Rawls, hold that respecting basic rights has lexical priority over maximizing aggregate happiness: one may consult utilitarian considerations only after rights constraints are satisfied. The ordering solves the incomparability problem by forbidding certain comparisons. We can adopt the same architecture for belief.\n\nPrinciple of Epistemic Priority (PEP): If one lacks sufficient epistemic justification for believing p, then\u2014barring radical sceptical scenarios\u2014one is epistemically required to withhold, full stop; practical reasons cannot make it rational to believe.\n\n3.2 Residual permissibility\n\nEpistemic evidence underdetermines our attitudes surprisingly often. For many everyday propositions\u2014Will the package arrive before noon?\u2014the evidence neither strongly supports nor decisively undermines belief. In that permissive zone, epistemic reasons issue a permission rather than a requirement: one may believe, disbelieve, or suspend. PEP then leaves room for practical reasons to operate.\n\nPractical Tie-Breaker (PTB): When (and only when) epistemic reasons render the doxastic options equipermissible, practical reasons can supply decisive guidance.\n\n3.3 Overall \u201cought\u201d\n\nOverall Rationality (OR): One ought, all things considered, to believe p if (i) epistemic reasons require belief, or (ii) epistemic reasons permit belief and practical reasons favor belief; analogously for disbelieving and suspending.\n\nBecause practical considerations never confront undefeated epistemic requirements, no commensuration is demanded. The structure is ordinal, not cardinal: \u201cepistemically required\u201d outranks any amount of pragmatic utility; within the epistemically permitted set, pragmatic weights become relevant.\n\n4. Putting the model to work\n\n4.1 Pascal revisited\n\nGiven ordinary evidence, epistemic reasons neither compel belief in God nor compel disbelief; suspension is rationally permitted. The infinite expected utility of believing (if one accepts Pascal\u2019s mathematics) now operates as a practical tie-breaker. Hence, on the hierarchical view, Pascalian faith can be rational\u2014without ever weighing \u201cinfinite utility\u201d against \u201cprobability \u00d7 truth value.\u201d Instead, we appeal to a division of labor: epistemic permission opens the door, pragmatic stakes walk through.\n\n4.2 Clifford\u2019s shipowner\n\nHere the shipowner\u2019s evidence does not epistemically permit belief that the vessel is seaworthy; it mandates doubt. Epistemic priority blocks subsequent pragmatic reasoning (\u201cIt would be profitable to believe\u201d) from altering the verdict. The hierarchical model thus reproduces Clifford\u2019s condemnation.\n\n4.3 High-stakes bank cases\n\nFantl and McGrath\u2019s well-known bank scenarios invite us to think that practical stakes affect whether one knows that the bank will be open Saturday. On the present view, what changes is not the epistemic standard for knowledge but the rational permissibility of acting on that belief. Because acting on a belief is itself a practical undertaking, it is appropriate that practical stakes influence action even while the doxastic status of the belief remains fixed by the original evidence.\n\n4.4 Moral encroachment\n\nSome argue (e.g., Bolinger 2021) that it takes more evidence to rationally believe a morally dangerous proposition (e.g., that a job applicant is less competent because of a protected characteristic). The hierarchical model explains the appearance without granting moral reasons direct epistemic force. The moral stakes make it pragmatically preferable to suspend rather than believe, provided belief is not epistemically mandated. Because underdetermination is rampant in social stereotyping cases, moral encroachment emerges as a second-order practical veto, not a new variety of evidence.\n\n5. Four objections answered\n\nObjection 1: The view is too rigid; sometimes pragmatic reasons should outweigh even strong evidence (e.g., a doctor tells a terminal patient an optimistic prognosis).\n\nReply. Two clarifications. First, asserting a proposition one does not believe is compatible with withholding belief; one can console the patient without self-deception. Second, rare \u201cself-enhancing\u201d beliefs arguably increase overall epistemic functioning (McKinnon 2023). In those unusual cases, the justification is still epistemic: believing improves future evidence-gathering capacities. So the counter-examples do not require pragmatic override.\n\nObjection 2: The evidential underdetermination condition is fuzzy. How do we know when evidence leaves us merely permitted rather than required?\n\nReply. Epistemology already faces the vague boundary between knowledge and mere justified belief. Our proposal inherits, but does not exacerbate, that indeterminacy. Moreover, the framework can incorporate any favored account of justification\u2014Bayesian, reliabilist, evidentialist. What matters is that whichever theory is correct, it will often classify multiple attitudes as permissible; those are precisely the occasions for PTB to operate.\n\nObjection 3: The model collapses into status quo evidentialism if epistemic defeats are ubiquitous, leaving no room for pragmatic impact.\n\nReply. Empirically, radical underdetermination is widespread: memory failures, testimonial conflicts, and time constraints constantly place agents below certainty thresholds. Everyday life is awash in epistemic permissibility. Even historians of science concede that the underdetermination of theory by data was severe in early cosmology, yet pragmatic values (elegance, calculational tractability) plausibly guided acceptance. There is therefore ample playground for practical reasons.\n\nObjection 4: Lexical ordering is ad hoc; why should truth be absolutely prior to value?\n\nReply. Two arguments: (i) Conceptual role. Belief aims constitutively at truth; to treat usefulness as sufficient for belief would alter the concept of belief into something like acceptance-in-action (Cohen 1992). Lexical priority preserves the constitutive aim. (ii) Regress argument. Allowing pragmatic override without constraint invites epistemic chaos: one could believe anything if the practical payoff is big enough. Lexical priority serves as a stable stopping point in deliberation.\n\n6. Responsible epistemic agency\n\nThe hierarchical model sits within a larger picture of agency that distinguishes three nested domains.\n\nAgen\ufeffcy domain 1: Theoretical rationality\u2014forming beliefs in response to evidence.  \n\nAgen\ufeffcy domain 2: Planning rationality\u2014adopting policies (including \u201ccredal policies\u201d like trusting testimony or using heuristics).  \n\nAgen\ufeffcy domain 3: Practical rationality\u2014choosing actions given beliefs and values.\n\nPractical reasons affect belief primarily by shaping planning rationality: should I join a religious community that will foster belief? Should I read climate-denial blogs? These second-order decisions are straightforwardly pragmatic. But once the policy funnels perceptual, testimonial, and inferential input into belief formation, first-order theoretical rationality regains priority. The hierarchical view is therefore not merely a patch on a problem case; it captures how diachronic responsible agency actually functions.\n\nConclusion\n\nEpistemic and practical reasons for belief do not need a common metric to interact. A hierarchical norm structure\u2014epistemic priority plus pragmatic tie-breakers\u2014explains our intuitions about Clifford, Pascal, high-stakes car loans, and moral encroachment while preserving the special authority of truth-conducive reasons. The model avoids collapse into monism or normative schizophrenia, maintains conceptual fidelity to the nature of belief, and retains sufficient flexibility for the messy underdetermination that pervades real cognitive life. If the account is correct, we reconcile the competing insights that (i) believing against the evidence is epistemically wrong, yet (ii) believing is not a value-insensitive enterprise. The resulting reconciliation is not a mysterious weighing of chalk and cheese; it is a disciplined sequence of deliberative stages. That is how incommensurable reasons can, after all, jointly determine what one ought to believe.", "output_tokens": 2912, "reasoning_tokens": 448}

The Quietist insists that whether you should believe p is ultimately a question of how much good or harm believing p will do; the Purist replies that whether you should believe p is ultimately a question of whether p is true. Many contemporary philosophers think both are partly right: we really do have epistemic reasons (having to do with truth-conduciveness) and practical reasons (having to do with value or welfare) that bear on what we ought to believe. But if those reasons are \u201cfundamentally different in kind,\u201d how could they ever interact to yield a single, all-things-considered (\u2018ATC\u2019) verdict about belief? Aren\u2019t they, as Bernard Williams once put it, \u201cnot on speaking terms\u201d?\n\nMy thesis is that the appearance of incommensurability is generated by a level-confusion. Epistemic and practical reasons operate at different normative levels, and once that difference is made explicit there is no need for a mysterious weighing or direct comparison. Epistemic reasons determine what you epistemically ought to believe; practical reasons determine what you ought to do with respect to your epistemic life (including whether to form a belief, suspend, postpone inquiry, lower the threshold for belief, and so on). When the question is framed correctly, the two kinds of reasons do not collide\u2014they interact by a division of labour coordinated by higher-order practical reasons concerning which epistemic norms to adopt in contexts with particular practical stakes. This \u201chierarchical interaction\u201d model preserves the intuition that truth matters non-instrumentally, yet explains how practical considerations can nevertheless bear on doxastic life without forcing us to translate truth and utility into a single common currency.\n\nThe argument proceeds in five steps:\n\n1. Clarify the target phenomenon by distinguishing three \u201coughts.\u201d\n2. Show why direct commensuration is unnecessary once those oughts are kept apart.\n3. Explain how practical reasons can nevertheless influence belief via higher-order norm selection and context-sensitive threshold-setting.\n4. Defend the model against three leading objections: the Voluntariness Objection, the Teleology Objection, and the Over-Demandingness Objection.\n5. Illustrate the view\u2019s pay-off with two cases\u2014the Nuclear Codes case and the Cassandra case\u2014that expose its explanatory advantages over purist, pragmatic-reductionist, and \u201cbuck-passing\u201d competitors.\n\n1. Three Oughts, Not One\n\nStart with an ordinary example. The morning news says the 8:03 train is on time. On ordinary evidence you might reasonably believe it will arrive as scheduled. But suppose today you must deliver urgently needed medicine; if you miss your connection, someone will die. Suddenly you feel the rational pressure to check additional sources, maybe call the station. Intuitively, the \u201csame\u201d evidence now seems insufficient for full belief. What changed? Not the epistemic quality of the evidence; what changed are the stakes. \n\nThis suggests three normative layers:\n\nE-Ought: what you epistemically ought to believe given your evidence (truth-conduciveness only).\nP-Ought: what you practically ought to do to promote overall value (includes choosing inquiry strategies).\nATC-Ought: what you ought to believe simpliciter, after all relevant kinds of reasons are considered.\n\nConflating these layers produces the incommensurability puzzle. We ask: \u201cHow do truth and utility trade off in determining ATC-Ought?\u201d But that question presupposes that E-reasons and P-reasons are supposed to pull on the same scale at the same level. The hierarchical interaction model denies that presupposition. Epistemic reasons govern E-Ought; practical reasons govern P-Ought; ATC-Ought emerges from an architecture in which P-reasons dictate, inter alia, which epistemic standards to apply before treating a proposition as sufficiently supported to count as the content of a belief. Truth and utility are therefore not weighed head-to-head; rather, practical stakes modulate the epistemic game you must play.\n\n2. The Myth of Direct Weighing\n\nIn many domains we already manage norm pluralism without commensurative weighing. Legal reasoning distinguishes questions of law from questions of fact; medical ethics distinguishes beneficence from informed consent; engineers distinguish safety margins from cost efficiency. Conflicts are resolved by a governance schema: one norm fixes a decision framework, another operates within it. Once the governance relation is settled, direct metric comparisons are unnecessary. My claim is that doxastic life displays the same layered structure: practical stakes govern the selection of an epistemic norm (or threshold), and within that norm the only admissible reasons are evidential.\n\nFormally, let S be a practical situation, E be the evidential state, T be a chosen epistemic threshold function \u03c4S mapping propositions to sufficient credence levels for belief in context S. Then:\n\n(i) Practical reasons select \u03c4S (call this \u201cepistemic policy decision\u201d).\n(ii) Epistemic reasons bearing on p (evidence E) determine whether credence(p, E) \u2265 \u03c4S.\n(iii) ATC-Ought(believe p) iff (i) and (ii) jointly obtain.\n\nBecause practical and epistemic reasons occupy different arguments of the overall decision function, no conversion factor between truth and utility is required. We simply need the practical reasons to fix \u03c4S; epistemic reasons then determine satisfaction of \u03c4S. This dissolves the specter of incommensurable \u201cweights.\u201d\n\n3. Pathways for Practical Influence\n\nHow, concretely, do practical reasons fix thresholds and other parameters of epistemic policy? At least three mechanisms are plausible:\n\na. Risk-Indexed Credence Thresholds. In high-stakes contexts the threshold for outright belief may shift upward. This is compatible with the idea that the \u201caim\u201d of belief remains truth: you still seek to maximize expected accuracy, but practical risk determines how much expected inaccuracy is tolerable before conferring the \u201cbelief\u201d label. In other words, the utility of accuracy has lexically prioritized status, but practical stakes set the tolerable error band.\n\nb. Inquiry Norms. Practical reasons can license or require additional evidence-gathering before settling on a belief. This is a second-order requirement: \u201cGiven the stakes, continue inquiry until your evidence reaches robustness r.\u201d Robert Stalnaker and Jane Friedman have both defended views on which \u201csuspend\u201d is the rational attitude absent robust enough evidence. Again, practical stakes fix r.\n\nc. Framing and Attention. Which propositions you actively consider is partly a function of practical import. You usually don\u2019t form beliefs about the number of grains of sand on Mars; practical irrelevance keeps those propositions outside your doxastic horizon. That selection effect is a pragmatically driven yet indirect influence on belief.\n\nAll three mechanisms allow practical reasons to shape the doxastic landscape without contaminating the evidential credentials of belief once the landscape is in place.\n\n4. Three Objections Answered\n\nObjection 1: Voluntariness. \u201cBelief isn\u2019t voluntary; so practical reasons\u2014like saving lives\u2014can\u2019t oblige me to believe against my evidence.\u201d\n\nReply: The hierarchical model does not require voluntaristic belief change in defiance of evidence. Practical reasons influence belief formation by modulating thresholds, inquiry, and attention\u2014actions and policies over which we do have voluntary control. Once you undertake the warranted epistemic policy, belief follows its own evidential path. No Cartesian act of will is posited.\n\nObjection 2: Teleology. \u201cBelief has a constitutive aim: truth. Allowing practical considerations compromises its teleology.\u201d\n\nReply: The model preserves a teleological core: within any fixed \u03c4S, belief is regulated exclusively by evidential reasons. Practical considerations have upstream jurisdiction over policy choice, not downstream jurisdiction over evidential assessment. So the aim of truth is not replaced by the aim of utility; utility merely governs risk management about attaining truth. Compare safety valves in engineering: they don\u2019t replace the aim of optimal performance; they set parameters under which performance counts as safe.\n\nObjection 3: Over-Demandingness. \u201cIf high stakes always raise thresholds, we would almost never be entitled to believe anything important, which seems absurdly demanding.\u201d\n\nReply: Threshold shifts can be bounded. A plausible rule is: raise \u03c4S only when the expected utility loss of error exceeds some salient cost parameter c. Everyday beliefs rarely cross that threshold because the expected harm of being wrong is trivial. Hence most ordinary contexts keep \u03c4S close to familiar permissive levels. The model predicts the right asymmetry: mundane beliefs are cheap, high-stakes beliefs are expensive.\n\n5. Two Illustrative Cases\n\nCase 1: Nuclear Codes.  \nA lieutenant receives a coded message: \u201cLaunch at 0900.\u201d Her evidence from protocol and codebook yields 0.9 credence that the order is authentic. Epistemically, 0.9 is usually more than enough for belief. But the practical catastrophe of wrongful launch is immense. On the hierarchical model, practical reasons impose an ultra-high belief threshold: perhaps \u03c4S = 0.999. Consequently, the lieutenant ATC-ought not believe the message and must seek confirmation. Here we explain why practical considerations \u201cdefeat\u201d belief without forcing a direct trade-off between truth and utility: they simply tighten the evidential bar.\n\nCase 2: Cassandra.  \nCassandra has strong although not conclusive evidence that her friend is cheating on his taxes. Reporting him would ruin their friendship and perhaps his livelihood. She faces pressure to \u201clook the other way.\u201d According to outright pragmatic encroachment views, the friendship stakes might lower the epistemic threshold and permit belief that he is innocent. The hierarchical model predicts the opposite: practical value sometimes requires *more scrutiny*, e.g., \u201cBefore you accuse, make sure.\u201d The stakes can raise or lower thresholds depending on the balance of error costs (false accusation vs. false acquittal). What matters is that the influence is mediated by the calculus of error cost, not by a direct evaluation of truth versus friendship.\n\nBy contrast, purist views cannot explain why the same evidence (say, a 0.7 credence) is sometimes sufficient and sometimes insufficient for belief, while pragmatic-reductionist views offer no story about why Cassandra\u2019s friendship shouldn\u2019t outright justify ignoring the evidence. The hierarchical model gets both cases right.\n\n6. Comparative Assessment\n\nHow does the present proposal fare versus rival accounts?\n\na. Dual-Ought Separatism (no ATC-Ought). Some deny there is any ATC-Ought about belief; there are merely E-Oughts and P-Oughts. But ordinary deliberation suggests otherwise: we routinely form single verdicts (\u201cI should believe the train is on time\u201d). The hierarchical model honors that datum while preserving normative pluralism.\n\nb. Direct Trade-Off Theories. Others import decision theory, assigning accuracy utilities to truth and balancing them against pragmatic payoffs in expected-value calculations. That achieves commensuration but at the cost of reifying cardinal accuracy values that are philosophically contentious. The hierarchical model yields similar predictions in most cases without the metaphysical overhead.\n\nc. Pragmatic Encroachment as Truth-Condition Inflation. Some contend that the truth norm itself incorporates practical stakes (e.g., Ruth Chang\u2019s \u201cobject-given reasons\u201d framework for action). Yet this blurs the explanatory division of labour: we lose traction on why and how stakes matter. The hierarchical model retains explanatory sharpness: practical stakes matter because they fix risk parameters given which epistemic norms apply.\n\n7. Broader Implications\n\nOnce we accept hierarchical interaction, several seemingly disparate debates align:\n\n\u2013 Knowledge as a Norm for Action. If the practical threshold for treating p as a basis for action is higher in high-stakes contexts, then knowledge may shift in tandem with belief thresholds (stake-sensitive knowledge). This explains the data often cited for pragmatic encroachment on knowledge without requiring stance-independent epistemic standards to vary.\n\n\u2013 Moral Encroachment. When belief about morally sensitive propositions (e.g., racial profiling) carries high social cost, practical reasons justifiably set more demanding evidential thresholds. The view vindicates moral encroachment as mediated rather than direct: morality does not overwrite evidence; it reconfigures the evidential bar.\n\n\u2013 Epistemic Permissivism. Difference in practical stakes among agents with identical evidence explains why both \u201cbelieve p\u201d and \u201csuspend on p\u201d can be rational: each may be using a different, pragmatically warranted threshold. Yet within each policy, truth remains the aim.\n\n8. Conclusion\n\nThe puzzle of incommensurable reasons assumes that epistemic and practical reasons must meet on the same floor and be commensurated like apples and oranges on a single scale. The hierarchical interaction model shows the assumption is mistaken. Practical reasons set the floor plan; epistemic reasons furnish the rooms. Because the division of labour is systematic and context-sensitive, an all-things-considered verdict about belief emerges without requiring a metaphysical super-scale on which truth and value are weighed directly.\n\nTo echo William James\u2019s famous line, \u201cOur needs and interests decide what questions are fit to ask,\u201d but once a question is fit to ask, evidence decides what answers to give. And that, I submit, is how epistemic and practical reasons speak to each other without talking past one another.", "output_tokens": 3565, "reasoning_tokens": 768}

But if both sets of reasons genuinely \u201cbear on\u201d what one ought to believe, how could they ever be weighed against one another?  They look, in Korsgaard\u2019s phrase, as though they belong to different \u201cpractical identities,\u201d and so are incommensurable.  The question is especially pressing when the reasons clash: you have excellent evidence that the medicine will fail, but telling the patient you believe this might crush her will to fight; you lack evidence for a consoling afterlife, but believing in it would ease your grief; you have only middling evidence your friend will keep his promise, but doubting him might itself provoke betrayal.  \n\nMy thesis is that the appearance of incommensurability rests on a level-confusion.  Epistemic and practical reasons do not compete within a single undifferentiated pool of first-order reasons for belief.  Rather, they operate at two distinct normative levels.  First-order reasons determine whether a specific doxastic attitude is accuracy-conducive given the subject\u2019s total evidence.  Higher-order (practical) reasons bear not directly on the proposition\u2019s truth but on which normative standard\u2014how demanding a level of evidential support\u2014one ought to adopt in the context at hand.  Once the appropriate evidential threshold is fixed by these higher-order considerations, only epistemic reasons decide whether the threshold is met.  In short:\n\n1. Practical reasons are second-order, governing what standard of epistemic permissibility is appropriate in the circumstances.  \n2. Epistemic reasons are first-order, governing whether, relative to that standard, one should believe, suspend, or disbelieve.  \n\nBecause they operate at different levels, the two kinds of reasons are not in fact commensurable competitors; they are nested.  They interact by a lexical ordering: practical reasons choose the evidential bar; epistemic reasons then do the selecting under that bar.  The interaction is intelligible, and it preserves the distinctive characters of the two reason-types.  \n\nI develop the view in four stages.  (A) I separate three \u201coughts\u201d that philosophers often run together.  (B) I model reason interaction with a stake-sensitive threshold familiar from decision theory and \u201cpragmatic encroachment\u201d literature.  (C) I defend the two-level model against prominent objections.  (D) I show how it illuminates classic cases and dissolves the alleged dilemma.  \n\nA. Three Oughts and Two Levels  \n\nWe must disentangle (i) the epistemic ought, (ii) the practical ought, and (iii) the all-things-considered ought.  \n\nThe epistemic ought: what one should believe in order to maximize accuracy or truth-conduciveness, holding fixed a standard of evidential sufficiency S.  Whether S is \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d \u201cpreponderance of evidence,\u201d or \u201cclear and convincing\u201d is not itself settled by epistemic reasons; it is a background parameter.  \n\nThe practical ought: what one should do to secure value\u2014prevent harm, realize moral goods, protect welfare.  Among the many things one can \u201cdo\u201d is adopting, sustaining, or refraining from doxastic attitudes, insofar as such attitudes are under some form of voluntary or semi-voluntary control.  \n\nThe all-things-considered ought: what one ought simpliciter when every kind of norm and every level is taken into account.  Reaching this verdict is a metanormative task; it requires rules for aggregating or ordering heterogeneous reasons.  \n\nIn light of these distinctions, our puzzle concerns how epistemic and practical reasons figure in the passage from their domain-relative oughts to the global ought.  The proposal to follow does not let practical reasons swamp epistemic ones; nor does it confine practical reasons to mere \u201cexcuses.\u201d  Instead, it allows each type its proper role by assigning them different normative functions.  \n\nB. A Stake-Sensitive Threshold Model  \n\nSuppose that for any proposition p, a subject S faces two questions:\n\n(Q1) What evidential threshold T must S meet to be permitted to believe p?  \n(Q2) Has the evidence E in fact met T?  \n\nEpistemic reasons answer Q2; practical reasons answer Q1.  The mechanism by which practical reasons answer Q1 is familiar from ordinary life: high-stakes contexts demand stricter standards.  In court, we require \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d before condemning; in casual gossip we relax to \u201csome indication.\u201d  Why?  Because the expected harm of error is vastly larger in the legal case than at the water cooler.  That is a practical consideration.  \n\nFormally, we can treat a doxastic decision as a two-stage choice under risk.  First choose T to maximize expected utility, where utility is a weighted function of two dimensions: accuracy (truth vs. falsity) and practical stakes (gains or losses conditional on the subject\u2019s subsequent actions, emotional costs, moral costs, etc.).  This mirrors the dual-value models in \u201caccuracy-first\u201d epistemology modified by Leitgeb, Dorst, and others.  Once T is fixed, evaluate E; if P(p|E) \u2265 T, belief is epistemically permitted; if \u2264 1\u2013T, disbelieve; otherwise suspend.  \n\nBecause accuracy carries some non-negotiable value\u2014it is the epistemic value\u2014any utility function that assigns zero value to accuracy is disqualified as an epistemic standard.  But within a large range of permissible weightings, practical stakes can legitimately tighten or relax T.  That is the locus of interaction.  \n\nCrucially, at stage two practical reasons drop out.  The only question is whether the evidential probability exceeds the chosen threshold.  Here epistemic reasons reign.  So we never have to weigh, say, \u201cevidence points to \u00acp\u201d against \u201cbelieving p will cheer me up.\u201d  They speak to different stages.  The first enters only after the second tells us how strong the evidence must be.  \n\nC. Replies to Four Objections  \n\nObjection 1: Doxastic voluntarism worries.  If belief is not the sort of thing we can choose, practical reasons cannot govern it, whether at level one or two.  \n\nReply: Even if full-blown voluntarism is false, we exercise indirect control over our doxastic policies: we select sources, adopt heuristics, allocate attention, and cultivate dispositions.  The threshold T is precisely such a policy variable.  The practical reasons bear on that policy choice, which then causally influences\u2014not magically dictates\u2014the beliefs that form downstream.  This is enough for responsibility and normative appraisal.  \n\nObjection 2: Lexical ordering is ad hoc; why privilege epistemic reasons in stage two?  \n\nReply: The privilege is not arbitrary; it is constitutive of belief as the attitude that aims at truth.  If we allowed practical reasons to intrude at stage two, we would collapse belief into mere acceptance for pragmatic purposes, obliterating the very category of epistemic evaluation.  The two-stage model respects the distinctive functional role of belief while still letting practical considerations shape the epistemic environment.  \n\nObjection 3: The model cannot explain strong moral encroachment claims, e.g., \u201cYou ought not believe that the suspect is guilty on racialized evidence, even if it is statistically overwhelming,\u201d where the objection is not about threshold but about the very sufficiency of the evidence.  \n\nReply: Notice that in such cases the complaint is precisely that the background standard is morally tainted: statistics about a demographic group do not, morally, raise the evidential probability in the right way.  That is a challenge to the reliability or aptness of the evidence, not a request to discount first-order truth-conducive reasons by practical ones.  The model accommodates this by letting practical reasons reject certain putative evidence as epistemically inadmissible (e.g., as violating norms of respect).  That is again a level-one intervention on the rules for what counts as evidence, leaving the internal logic of evidential support intact.  \n\nObjection 4: The view yields awkward results in Pascal-style cases where expected practical payoff is infinite.  Doesn\u2019t that force arbitrarily low thresholds and hence wishful believing?  \n\nReply: Two replies.  (i) Infinite payoffs are artifacts of crude modelling; more nuanced utility functions cap payoffs by risk of self-deception and resource constraints.  (ii) Even granting the infinity, the model entails only that the threshold may be lowered, perhaps dramatically, but not eliminated.  If one\u2019s evidence for God is literally zero, no threshold\u2014however low\u2014is met; believing would still violate the epistemic stage.  So the view avoids unconditional wishful thinking.  \n\nD. Case Studies  \n\n1. Clifford\u2019s Shipowner.  The shipowner\u2019s evidence that the vessel is seaworthy is weak.  The practical stakes (human lives) impose an extremely demanding threshold.  Since the evidence does not meet that threshold, epistemic reasons forbid belief.  Practical reasons reinforce the prohibition, since adopting a lax threshold would itself be irresponsible.  Result: do not believe, do not sail.  Clifford\u2019s moral condemnation is rendered intelligible without letting the moral reasons \u201cbeat\u201d good evidence\u2014there never was enough evidence in the first place.  \n\n2. The Cheerful Patient.  A doctor has decisive evidence that the experimental drug will not work.  Could she permissibly believe otherwise for the patient\u2019s sake?  No.  Practical reasons speak at level one: they might license withholding disclosure, or adopting a policy of optimistic framing, but they cannot license lowering T below the evidence\u2019s actual probability (near zero) to allow belief.  To do so would co-opt belief itself as a therapeutic tool, subverting its truth-aim.  \n\n3. High-Stakes Bank Closing (Fantl & McGrath).  It is Friday afternoon; I see the posted hours and form the credence 0.8 that the bank is open Saturday.  If the stakes are low, threshold T may be 0.7; belief is permitted.  If the stakes are my family\u2019s foreclosure, T may rise to 0.95; now belief is not permitted, though action might still be (go to the bank).  The two-stage model reproduces the intuitive verdicts of stake-sensitive pragmatic encroachment without positing direct trade-offs between evidence and value.  \n\n4. Promissory Trust.  Suppose I have moderate evidence (0.6) that my friend will keep his promise.  Doubting him would insult him and might induce betrayal.  The practical reason to trust raises no stakes for believing\u2014the cost of a false positive is modest\u2014so the threshold may legitimately be set at 0.5.  Belief is permissible and perhaps required.  Again, no weighing of apples and oranges: practical reasons fix the rule, epistemic reasons apply it.  \n\nE. Advantages of the Two-Level Account  \n\n1. Avoids incommensurability:  Instead of comparing incomparable first-order reasons, we order them lexically by level.  \n\n2. Preserves the truth-aim of belief:  Epistemic reasons remain truth-conducive; practical reasons never license belief contrary to the best evidence once the threshold is set.  \n\n3. Explains pragmatic encroachment without collapsing domains:  Stakes matter, but only by altering the evidential bar.  \n\n4. Handles moral encroachment and testimonial injustice:  Practical norms can disqualify certain premises or inference patterns as epistemically illegitimate, again at the policy level.  \n\n5. Accounts for epistemic permissibility pluralism:  Different contexts legitimately host different standards (scientific vs. journalistic vs. everyday), each set by their characteristic practical regimes.  \n\nF. Residual Worries and Future Directions  \n\nReader may worry that the model relegates practical reasons to mere background scenery; after setting the threshold they are done.  But that is exactly what intellectual integrity requires.  Belief is essentially answerable to evidence; still, our practical identities determine how circumspect we must be before settling opinions.  The result is that belief remains recognizably belief, yet is alive to the realities of moral and prudential life.  \n\nA deeper metanormative worry is whether a single lexical ordering can always be justified.  Might there be sui generis cases where first-order evidence and practical value collide so directly that no nested ordering is possible?  Perhaps, but to establish such cases one must show that (a) the stakes could not intelligibly be coded into the standard of evidence, and (b) that permitting belief would not thereby undermine belief\u2019s aim.  I suspect purported counterexamples either fail (a) or violate (b), but detailed case studies remain to be done.  \n\nAnother frontier concerns doxastic attitudes beyond full belief\u2014graded credence, imaginative assumption, acceptance for inquiry.  The present account generalizes: practical reasons pick an accuracy-loss function and confidence threshold; epistemic reasons minimize loss relative to that function.  Indeed, the generality suggests a research program: explore which decision-theoretic loss functions are licensed by which practical contexts, and how they shape the landscape of rational belief revision.  \n\nConclusion  \n\nThe sense that epistemic and practical reasons are incommensurable dissolves once we notice they answer different questions about belief.  Practical reasons set the rules of the doxastic game\u2014how much evidence do we need given what is at stake?  Epistemic reasons then play the game by those rules\u2014does the evidence we actually possess suffice?  Because the levels are distinct, the reasons do not collide; they cooperate.  The result honors truth as the constitutive value of belief while allowing our moral and prudential concerns to govern the epistemic policies under which we operate.  Thus there is a perfectly intelligible, non-mysterious interaction between the two kinds of reasons, and the apparent incommensurability is a mirage born of collapsing levels that ought to be kept apart.", "output_tokens": 3581, "reasoning_tokens": 576}

Suppose that on fairly weak evidence you start to suspect that your new pharmaceutical compound is safe.  You also know that if you go on believing this, you will skip a costly additional toxicity study that would delay bringing a life-saving drug to market.  Human lives (and millions of dollars) are plausibly at stake.  Do you epistemically ought to withhold belief until stronger evidence comes in, or do you practically ought to believe now so that the drug can reach needy patients sooner?  If both \u201cepistemic reasons\u201d (concerning truth) and \u201cpractical reasons\u201d (concerning welfare) are genuine normative pressures, how could they possibly be commensurable?  What single deliberative output could respect such heterogeneous inputs?\n\nI defend the following thesis.  \n\nThesis.  Epistemic reasons and practical reasons do not need to be weighed on a common scale in order to interact.  Instead, practical reasons exert their influence by normatively gating the deliberative route through which epistemic reasons issue in belief.  Epistemic reasons alone determine what it is correct to believe, but practical reasons determine whether the doxastic response that would be epistemically correct is *all-things-considered required, merely permitted, or outright forbidden*.  The interaction is therefore *structural* rather than *aggregative*: the two kinds of reasons occupy different functional roles in the normative architecture, so no commensuration problem arises.\n\nI will proceed in five steps.  (1) I clarify the alleged incommensurability and why the usual weighing picture looks hopeless.  (2) I extract a neglected distinction between *content-directing* and *route-directing* reasons, which allows heterogeneous reasons to interact without comparison along a common metric.  (3) I develop a \u201cgatekeeping\u201d model on which practical reasons modulate the route from evidence to belief instead of competing for evidential weight.  (4) I show how the model handles three classic cases: Pascalian high-stakes religion, Jamesian will-to-believe friendships, and scientific policy under uncertainty.  (5) I compare the view dialectically with evidentialist purism and pragmatic encroachment, arguing that it preserves the chief insights of each while escaping their chief liabilities.\n\n1.  The Incommensurability worry\n\nLaurence BonJour once quipped that believing for practical reasons is as bad as \u201ctaking a cab to the truth.\u201d  The reasons belong to different currencies.  Epistemic reasons are reasons *for truth-tracking attitudes*; practical reasons are reasons *for utility-promoting actions*.  This heterogeneity seems to preclude a single cardinal scale of \u201coverall normative force.\u201d  When a utilitarian says that two units of pleasure outweigh one unit of pain, the units are commensurable.  But how many microns of evidential support equal a micromort of expected lives saved?  There is not even a conceptual foothold for asking the question.  So, the thought goes, the very idea of an \u201call-things-considered ought to believe\u201d is confused.\n\nThe natural counterpart to incommensurability is *disaggregation*: maybe there is an epistemic ought and a practical ought, full stop.  Yet disaggregation leaves us normatively rudderless.  A scientist deliberating whether to publish preliminary results cannot act on two oughts at once; sooner or later she must take exactly one doxastic stance.  If the norms are genuinely authoritative, they must jointly determine a verdict, even if one wins out by defeat or cancellation.  The philosophical task, then, is to vindicate joint governance without requiring a single scale.\n\n2.  Content-directing vs. Route-directing reasons\n\nAn overlooked tool is the following distinction.\n\nContent-directing reason: a consideration that bears on *which specific content* should occupy the belief state.  \nRoute-directing reason: a consideration that bears on *whether and how* one should pass from some antecedent cognitive state to a new one.\n\nEvidence that p (the drug passed 90% of toxicity assays) speaks directly in favor of the content \u2018p\u2019.  If the evidence is strong enough, rationality requires belief in that very proposition.  By contrast, the reason \u201cbelieving p would save lives\u201d does not speak directly for the content of p; the lives would be saved *whether or not p is actually true*.  What the practical reason does, rather, is to give you reason to *endorse, retain, or initiate* a belief-forming process whose output is p, provided that process is not epistemically disreputable.\n\nCrucially, route-directing reasons do not purport to settle the truth of p.  Instead, they either:\n\n(a) license treating available evidence as *sufficient* (permissive gate),  \n(b) mandate adopting any epistemically permissible route that leads to p (requiring gate), or  \n(c) forbid entertaining the very question because of catastrophic downside risk (prohibitive gate).\n\nBecause the two kinds of reasons regulate different aspects of the doxastic economy, they need not be balanced numerically.  One set determines the map; the other regulates which paths through the map you may or must take.\n\n3.  The gatekeeping model\n\nLet us formalize.  For any agent S and proposition p, consider:\n\nE-level: the total evidential support E for p available to S.  \nT-threshold: the minimal evidential level required for epistemic correctness (truth-conducive justification).  \nGate G: a normative status determined by S\u2019s practical context C.\n\nDefinition.  S is *all-things-considered permitted* to believe p iff E \u2265 T and G \u2260 prohibit.  \nS is *all-things-considered required* to believe p iff E \u2265 T and G = require.  \nS is *all-things-considered forbidden* to believe p iff G = prohibit, even if E \u2265 T.\n\nEpistemic reasons fix T.  Practical reasons fix G.  There is no summing; rather, practical reasons either open, mandate, or close the channel by which epistemically adequate evidence may culminate in belief.\n\nRoute-dependence explains why practical reasons seem unable to make up for evidential deficits.  If E < T, no amount of practical value can directly supply missing warrant, for practical reasons address the gate, not the threshold.  Yet practical reasons can tip the final verdict wherever E already clears T but the route\u2019s status remains unsettled.  The mysterious \u201cinteraction\u201d thus reduces to a two-stage process with two different normative currencies.\n\nWhy think practical reasons legitimately play this gatekeeping role?  Because doxastic deliberation occurs in agents who must act under uncertainty.  The *stakes* of error can sometimes change what it is permissible to gamble on.  Consider an evidential tie between two hypotheses of minor theoretical interest; believing one for aesthetic reasons does no harm.  Now raise the stakes to a medical verdict on a pandemic vaccine.  The very same evidential profile is suddenly insufficient: withholding until replication is no longer optional.  What changed is not the evidential weight but the normative gate: practical disaster looms if a high-impact error occurs.  Treating the same E as epistemically insufficient under high stakes is a familiar phenomenon labeled \u201cpragmatic encroachment,\u201d but our structural analysis makes clear that it is encroachment on permissibility, not on *truth-directed* justification itself.\n\n4.  Three test cases\n\n(a) Pascal\u2019s Wager.  Blaise Pascal argues that the expected utility of believing in God swamps any finite disutility of error.  On our model, the practical reason is enormous, so G = require.  Yet epistemic correctness requires crossing T.  The real objection to the Wager is therefore not that infinite utility cannot outweigh finite evidence (there is no weighing!) but that the route from E to belief would be epistemically corrupt if E is far below T.  Pascal\u2019s own proposed route\u2014deciding to believe by habituation\u2014fails to respect justification norms.  The gate may be wide open, but the bridge hasn\u2019t reached the threshold, so belief remains impermissible.\n\n(b) James\u2019s \u201cWill to Believe\u201d friendships.  William James holds that in certain \u201cgenuine options\u201d (living, forced, momentous) it is permissible to believe ahead of evidence\u2014for instance, trusting a new friend\u2019s goodwill can itself create the very evidence of trustworthiness.  The gatekeeping model captures this as follows: practical stakes (forming the friendship) set G = permissive.  The epistemic threshold depends partly on *expected future evidence*: by trusting, you participate in a feedback loop that will quickly provide confirming or disconfirming data.  The total E including foreseeable experiential evidence may therefore meet T at the moment of commitment.  James\u2019s permissivism is thus vindicated without treating practical stakes as direct epistemic currency.\n\n(c) Drug approval under uncertainty.  Suppose preliminary data give a vaccine candidate 70% likelihood of safety.  For ordinary consumer products, T might be .95.  But during a lethal pandemic, regulators may lower the acceptable threshold to .70, not because truth suddenly matters less, but because the cost of delay raises T\u2019s pragmatic dimension.  This looks like pragmatic encroachment but is better modeled as route modulation: emergency use authorization opens the gate earlier, provided the testing route is still epistemically respectable science.  Once T is formally lowered by policy, epistemic and practical considerations again cooperate without commensuration.\n\n5.  Dialectical positioning\n\nEvidentialist purists (e.g., Shah & Velleman) insist that practical reasons are the wrong kind of reasons for belief\u2014they are \u201calienating\u201d because they fail to track truth.  Purists therefore maintain that there is only an epistemic ought simpliciter.  Yet purism fares poorly in high-stakes contexts where acting on truth alone could be catastrophic.  The gatekeeping model honors the purist insight that only evidence can make a content credibly true, while acknowledging the practical insight that the *permissibility of forming beliefs* cannot be fully divorced from the consequences of error.\n\nPragmatic encroachers (e.g., Fantl & McGrath) claim that the very standards of knowledge or justification rise and fall with stakes.  This yields elegant explanations of some intuitive verdicts but at the cost of blurring the line between discovering truth and managing risk.  Our account preserves the evidential constancy of truth-aimed justification while reproducing the variable-stakes phenomena at the level of gate functions.  The evidence required to clear T is fixed by epistemic norms; what changes with stakes is whether a route that already meets T is compulsory or forbidden.\n\nOne might worry that the gatekeeping picture still permits doxastic akrasia: situations where you epistemically ought to believe p (E \u2265 T) but all-things-considered ought not (G = prohibit).  Is such conflict coherent?  Yes; it mirrors akrasia in action where you morally ought to keep a promise but prudentially ought to break it.  Rationality can recognize genuine normative conflict.  The model simply explains the *source* of the conflict without requiring an impossible weighing procedure.\n\n6.  Advantages and open questions\n\nAdvantages.\n\n(1) No common metric: interaction is orthogonal rather than aggregative.  \n(2) No wrong-kind worries: practical reasons never \u201cmanufacture truth,\u201d they only regulate permission to rely on truth-tracking processes.  \n(3) Predictive power: the model explains why very high stakes sometimes *raise* evidential demands (forbidden gate) and sometimes *lower* them (require gate), depending on background asymmetries in false-positive versus false-negative costs.\n\nOpen questions.\n\n(i) Are there cases where practical reasons override evidence even when E < T?  Religious faith traditions sometimes urge outright venture beyond evidence.  The gatekeeping model would diagnose such cases as violations of epistemic norm, but perhaps some theologies embrace that violation knowingly.  Whether such \u201cleaps\u201d are ever rational may rest on meta-normative debates about the authority of epistemic norms themselves.\n\n(ii) What fixes T?  If the epistemic threshold is itself context-sensitive (e.g., depends on reliability of instruments), then our tidy separation needs refinement.  A promising move is to treat instrument reliability as part of E rather than T, preserving the division of labor.\n\n(iii) How does higher-order evidence (e.g., testimony about your own cognitive biases) interact with the gate?  Here route and content intermingle, suggesting a dynamic hierarchy: practical reasons can trigger procedures (e.g., double-blind review) that effectively transform the evidence base.\n\nConclusion\n\nOnce we distinguish reasons that aim at *which content* should be believed from reasons that govern *whether and how* to move into any content-state at all, the specter of incommensurability dissolves.  Epistemic reasons fix the standards of correctness; practical reasons gate our entitlement to act on those standards given our value-laden circumstances.  The interaction is thus structural, not comparative.  We need not perform metaphysical alchemy to transform truth into utility or vice versa.  Instead, we recognize a layered normative architecture: epistemic norms direct the map; practical norms determine the permissible routes.  This framework vindicates common-sense judgments across Pascalian gambles, Jamesian leaps, and pandemic science, while preserving the integrity of our truth-seeking enterprise.", "output_tokens": 3164, "reasoning_tokens": 320}

Orientation and Thesis  \n\nWe face a familiar normative puzzle.  On the one hand, epistemic reasons\u2014evidence that p\u2014seem to mandate believing p, regardless of what anyone stands to gain or lose from doing so.  On the other hand, practical reasons\u2014 stakes, harms, moral duties\u2014sometimes appear to speak just as urgently.  A doctor who possesses weak but suggestive evidence that a drug is lethal to her patient may rationally suspend judgment even though the statistical balance of evidence favors safety; the moral stakes make caution rational.  But how can epistemic and practical reasons, apparently grounded in distinct value domains (truth vs. welfare), be combined into a single \u201cought\u201d?  \n\nMy thesis is a hybrid view:  \n\n     Hybridism: All normative reasons for belief share a unified currency\u2014expected value for the\n     believing agent conceived as an epistemic planner\u2014because (i) belief is a species of cognitive\n     action aimed primarily at accuracy, yet (ii) the aim of accuracy is itself defeasible in light of\n     broader agential goals.  Epistemic reasons supply accuracy-value, practical reasons supply\n     stake-value, and a decision-theoretic aggregator, constrained by accuracy\u2019s default priority,\n     yields an all-things-considered verdict.\n\nHybridism (i) vindicates the intuition that truth normally dominates, (ii) explains how high-stakes or moral considerations can override evidence, and (iii) renders interaction between epistemic and practical reasons intelligible without collapsing one domain into the other.\n\nThe argument proceeds in six steps.\n\n1. Clarifying the Puzzle: Three Distinctions  \n\n1.1 Normative vs. Motivating Reasons  \nA normative reason is a fact that counts in favor of \u03c6-ing, whether or not it actually moves the agent.  A motivating reason is whatever the agent takes to justify her \u03c6-ing.  The puzzle concerns normative reasons: what genuinely counts, not mere psychology.\n\n1.2 Belief vs. Credence  \nBelief is full acceptance; credence is graded confidence.  Hybridism applies most naturally to credence, then derives belief via a bridging rule (e.g., believe when credence > 0.9 absent overriding costs).  Finessing the puzzle at the credence level avoids the binary \u201cweighing the incommensurable\u201d drama.\n\n1.3 Rightness, Rationality, Permissibility  \nWe speak of a belief as epistemically justified, practically prudent, or all-things-considered permissible.  Hybridism targets the last of these: overall permissibility.  Epistemic rightness remains a narrower category whose standard is purely truth-conduciveness.  Accordingly, \u201cE-ought\u201d and \u201cP-ought\u201d can conflict without contradiction, much as legal and moral oughts can conflict.\n\n2. Why Simple Dualism Fails  \n\nA natural response is dual-ism: there are two independent \u201coughts,\u201d epistemic and practical; conflict is not to be resolved but merely acknowledged.  Yet everyday deliberation tells against this.  When stakes escalate, we do not merely note a clash\u2014we change our doxastic policy.  James\u2019s \u201cright to believe\u201d in religious contexts and contemporary pragmatic encroachment cases show that people feel genuinely torn, not just spectators to parallel scoreboards.\n\nMoreover, decisions downstream of belief (treatment plans, voting, testimony) depend on which attitude wins.  Hence rational agents need a principled aggregator, not compartmentalization.\n\n3. Toward a Common Currency: The Expected Utility of Cognitive Acts  \n\n3.1 Believing as a Cognitive Action  \nWhile belief aims at truth, forming or withholding belief is something one does\u2014sometimes quickly and involuntarily, but nevertheless subject to diachronic control (research more, consult experts, double-check).  As such, belief formation can be evaluated by the same formal tools we apply to overt action: expected utility.\n\n3.2 Epistemic Utility  \nAccuracy has quantitative surrogates\u2014proper scoring rules such as Brier score or logarithmic loss.  For any credence function C, the expected accuracy with respect to evidence E is \u2211C(p)\u22c5S(p), where S captures the penalty for error.  Hence epistemic reasons admit cardinal representation.\n\n3.3 Practical Utility  \nOrdinary stakes (health, money, morality) are already modelled in expected utility theory.  Practical reasons thus come with their own (often inexact) utilities.\n\n3.4 Aggregating the Two  \nSuppose the agent assigns weights \u03b1 (accuracy) and \u03b2 (stakes) to each component.  A naive summation \u03b1U_epistemic + \u03b2U_practical yields commensurability at a stroke.  The worry now is arbitrariness: why those weights?  Hybridism answers: default \u03b1\u226b\u03b2, because the constitutive aim of belief is accuracy; nevertheless \u03b2>0 because no constitutive aim is absolute\u2014belief ultimately serves agency, and agency is embedded in a broader evaluative field.\n\nThis \u201clexical priority with override\u201d structure is familiar from ethics (Kantian side-constraints modifiable by catastrophe) and law (free speech except in clear-and-present danger).  By analogy, truth has lexical priority unless the stakes cross a seriousness threshold.  The threshold\u2019s vagueness explains why reasonable agents may permissibly diverge under moderate stakes.\n\n4. Illustrations that Do Work  \n\n4.1 The Cholera Lab Notebook  \nAn epidemiologist discovers faint evidence that cholera is waterborne (correct), but publication may trigger panic and economic collapse if wrong.  Hybridism predicts:  \n\n\u2022 Epistemically, she ought to believe.  \n\u2022 Practically, she ought not yet publish.  \n\u2022 All-things-considered, with stakes high and evidence modest, she should suspend or at least lower credence until further trials, because the loss function for a false positive is catastrophic.\n\nNote how belief and action interplay: if she cannot compartmentalize, then doxastic suspension achieves the practical aim without misrepresenting data as contradictory.\n\n4.2 The Costless Coin  \nYou flip a fair coin in a no-stakes environment.  Hybridism reduces to pure epistemic evaluation (\u03b2\u22480).  Belief that the coin landed heads without looking is irrational; with observation, rational.  Thus Hybridism collapses to evidentialism in ordinary scientific contexts\u2014an explanatory virtue.\n\n4.3 The \u201cToo Good to Check\u201d Rumor  \nClick-bait headlines tempt belief because they confirm cherished political narratives, generating social utility (likes, group bonding).  Hybridism condemns such belief: \u03b2>0 but tiny; \u03b1 dominates.  So evidentialism is restored; the theory does not license motivated reasoning.\n\n5. Objections and Replies  \n\nObjection 1: Constitutivism\u2014Belief is by nature regulated only by truth; admitting \u03b2>0 corrupts the concept.  \nReply: No one thinks the aim of moral judgment (tracking rightness) forbids considering epistemic humility when evidence is thin.  Similarly, the constitutive aim sets the default but not indefeasible norm.  Hybridism still distinguishes epistemic rightness (truth-only) from overall permissibility.\n\nObjection 2: Incommensurability\u2014Accuracy and welfare lack a shared metric.  Expected utility\u2019s numbers are artifacts.  \nReply: The worry is strongest if the utilities purport to measure objective value.  Hybridism needs only an agent-relative ranking of possible cognitive policies.  Agents routinely exchange micro-accuracy (e.g., keep a precise grocery total) for effort savings; revealing that they already trade accuracy against practical goods.  Quantification codifies an existing competence, not invents it.\n\nObjection 3: Moral Encroachment is Too Demanding  \nSuppose racial bias affects policing statistics.  Hybridism says police must raise evidential thresholds before believing a suspect armed.  Critics charge that this politicizes belief.  \nReply: The objection confirms, rather than undermines, that we already remit belief to moral stakes.  Hybridism merely supplies the structure: high wrongful-harm cost expands the suspension region.  The view is demanding\u2014but in proportion to the moral gravity at issue.\n\nObjection 4: Slippery Slope to Wishful Thinking  \nIf practical reasons count, won\u2019t agents believe lottery success to feel happy?  \nReply: Lexical priority and accurate scoring rules prevent this: tiny \u03b2 cannot trump massive \u03b1 in low-stakes contexts; the expected disutility of massive inaccuracy outweighs fleeting happiness.  Only exceptional practical costs (loss of life, catastrophic moral wrong) override.\n\n6. Advantages over Rivals  \n\n6.1 Over Pragmatic Encroachment  \nPragmatic encroachment says the epistemic standard itself rises with stakes.  That predicts that in high-stakes contexts a belief may be epistemically unjustified even if supported by the same evidence justifying it in low-stakes cases.  Hybridism preserves a stable epistemic standard (truth-value) and shifts the overall \u2018ought\u2019, avoiding conceptual inflation of \u201cknowledge.\u201d\n\n6.2 Over Pure Consequentialism  \nA purely pragmatist view (believe whatever maximizes utility) treats accuracy as one good among many, risking dogmatism when happiness is easier to secure by false belief.  Hybridism\u2019s lexical priority accords with our intuitive intolerance for self-deception outside emergencies.\n\n6.3 Over Pure Evidentialism  \nHybridism explains Jamesian faith, clinical precaution, and moral encroachment without reclassifying them as non-epistemic.  The epistemic purist must either bite bullets (believe safety despite lethal risk) or complicate the action-belief interface ad hoc.\n\n7. How the Aggregation Works in Detail  \n\n7.1 Formal Schematic  \nLet B be a set of credence functions.  The agent chooses C* \u2208 B to maximize:  \nEU(C) = \u03b1 \u22c5 E_accuracy(C) + \u03b2 \u22c5 E_stakes(C).  \nE_accuracy(C) = \u2212\u2211p C(p)\u22c5(1 \u2013 v(p)), where v(p)=1 if p is true.  \nE_stakes(C) = \u2211w\u2208Worlds Pr(w|C)\u22c5U_practical(w).  \n\n7.2 Threshold Model  \nSet \u03b1=1.  Let \u03b2>0 only if |Worst-case practical loss| > T, where T tracks a contextually supplied \u201cseriousness\u201d boundary (e.g., risk of death).  Otherwise \u03b2=0.  This reproduces the intuitive step-function: low stakes do not encroach.\n\n7.3 Permissibility vs. Requirement  \nBecause \u03b2 is vague and contextual, multiple credence functions may tie for maximal EU, yielding permissibility rather than uniqueness.  Thus Hybridism predicts genuine epistemic humility where evidence is intermediate\u2014an attractive consequence for peer disagreement cases.\n\n8. Metanormative Payoff: Unity without Reduction  \n\nHybridism respects pluralism of value while securing action-guidance.  It avoids value monism (truth is the only good) and avoids fractured normativity (multiple incommensurable oughts).  The unifying currency is not metaphysically mysterious: it is whatever ranking a rational agent with both cognitive and practical ends must implicitly employ to choose policies under uncertainty.  In this sense, the \u201ccommensuration\u201d problem is solved at the level of agency rather than metaphysics.  Rational deliberators already know how to trade minutes of effort against probability of error; stakes merely extend that trading up the seriousness ladder.\n\n9. Open Questions and Research Agenda  \n\nHybridism sketches, rather than completes, a theory.  Two salient projects remain:\n\nA. Calibration of Threshold T:  How do social institutions (science, law) set shared seriousness thresholds so that individual arbitrariness does not erode epistemic reliability?  \n\nB. Varieties of Practical Reasons:  Are moral reasons uniquely capable of overriding accuracy, or do prudential reasons suffice?  Might shame or aesthetic value ever override?  Experimental philosophy could test folk judgments; normative theory can look for principled lines.\n\nIf Hybridism proves fruitful, it could inform legal standards of evidence (\u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d varies with penalty), medical epistemology (precautionary belief), and AI alignment (weighing accuracy of prediction models against downstream harms).\n\nConclusion  \n\nThe apparent incommensurability of epistemic and practical reasons dissolves once we treat belief as a cognitive action subject to expected-value analysis, anchored by a constitutive priority for truth but sensitive to catastrophic stakes.  Hybridism offers a unified, flexible, and principled account of how evidence and value jointly determine what one ought, all things considered, to believe.  Rather than choosing between Clifford\u2019s evidentialism and James\u2019s will-to-believe, we can understand them as articulating lexical layers in a single normative system.", "output_tokens": 3047, "reasoning_tokens": 320}

Introduction and Thesis\n\nSince the discovery of so-called \u201cmirror neurons\u201d in the premotor cortex of macaques, a seductive idea has taken hold in both philosophy of mind and cognitive science: we see what an agent is up to because our own motor system covertly rehearses the very action we observe. Motor resonance (MR) is supposed to provide the inner scaffolding that transforms mere kinematic light on the retina into an intelligible, richly structured perception of goal-directed behavior. Many authors therefore claim something like the following Necessity Thesis:\n\n(NT) An observer perceives an action as goal-directed only if the observer\u2019s motor system can, and in fact does, resonate with (simulate) that action.\n\nIn this essay I will argue that NT is false. Motor resonance is neither necessary nor constitutive of the perceptual experience of goal-directedness. It is, rather, one among several resources\u2014sometimes dispensable, sometimes decisively helpful\u2014that the nervous system can deploy to enrich or disambiguate what is already available in ordinary visual apprehension. My argument proceeds in three stages.\n\n1. Conceptual analysis: NT rests on an equivocation between \u201cperception\u201d narrowly construed (a modality-specific, early sensory process that provides the format of experience) and broader epistemic access to others\u2019 intentions. Once the meaning of \u201cperception\u201d is fixed, MR loses its claim to necessity.\n\n2. Empirical counterexamples: A range of findings\u2014perception of non-biological agents, action recognition by individuals without the corresponding motor repertoire, and preserved goal attribution under TMS-induced disruption of MR\u2014demonstrate that observers can perceive goal-directed action when resonance is impossible or suppressed.\n\n3. Positive account: An ecological-and-predictive alternative explains how purely visual information about distal affordances, temporal structure, and environmental constraints suffices for the perception of goal-directedness, while leaving room for MR as an efficiency booster. \n\n2. Clarifying the Terrain: What Needs Explaining?\n\n2.1 Perception vs. Cognitive Attribution\n\nAt least three phenomena often run together in the literature:\n\n(a) Visual discrimination: detecting that a movement is generated by an agent rather than by physics alone.\n\n(b) Perceptual grouping: organizing the unfolding motion into coherent action units (reaching, grasping, turning).\n\n(c) Intentional interpretation: experiencing the movement as directed toward a goal or purpose.\n\nMotor-resonance theorists frequently target (c), yet the relevant evidence they cite tends to concern performance on tasks tapping (a) or (b) (e.g., reaction-time gains in biological-motion detection when the observer\u2019s motor cortex is primed). The relation between these phenomena is non-trivial. One can register purposiveness without parsing every micro-segment of kinematics, and one can visually parse motions without knowing what they are for. Thus, the first demand on NT is to specify which of (a)\u2013(c) requires MR. Most proponents appear to mean (c), but the bulk of their experimental support addresses (b). My own claim concerns (c): the felt purposiveness of another\u2019s movement does not depend on MR.\n\n2.2 Two Notions of \u201cNecessity\u201d\n\nPhilosophers distinguish metaphysical necessity (\u201ccould not be otherwise in any possible world\u201d) from nomological necessity (\u201ccould not be otherwise given the laws of our world\u201d), and both from methodological necessity (\u201ctheory A cannot explain phenomenon P without positing X\u201d). NT has been read in all three ways. Only the second, nomological reading is relevant to empirical science, so I will treat NT*:\n\n(NT*) Given the actual human sensory-motor architecture, MR is a nomologically necessary condition for perceiving goal-directed action.\n\nThe question is whether NT* is supported by current knowledge. If counterexamples exist\u2014actual human agents who perceive goals in the absence of MR\u2014then NT* is falsified.\n\n3. Empirical Counterexamples\n\n3.1 Congenital Motor Impairments\n\nA decisive test for NT* is offered by individuals born without specific motor capacities. Strikingly, people with congenital limb absence discriminate goal-directed hand actions in standard tasks (e.g., point-light displays) as accurately and quickly as matched controls, despite having never executed, and so never resonated with, hand movements. The same holds for the deaf who have never produced speech gestures yet lip-read efficiently; for the congenitally blind when tactilely exploring others\u2019 actions; and for spinal cord injury patients whose corticospinal pathways for leg movement are permanently silent yet who immediately detect intentionality in soccer videos.\n\nObjection: Perhaps these observers recruit homologous motor circuits despite lacking the peripheral effectors.\n\nReply: Neuroimaging reveals that when congenital amputees see grasping actions, their sensorimotor cortex does not show the somatotopic hand activation observed in controls; instead, modality-general areas such as the posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) are engaged. Their preserved performance therefore cannot be explained by MR.\n\n3.2 Cross-Species and Cross-Morphological Perception\n\nHumans routinely, and spontaneously, perceive goal-directedness in actions no human could perform: a dog circling to lie down, a hummingbird hovering, a Roomba vacuming, or even a chess-playing robotic arm with six joints at alien angles. Because no resonance mapping exists for flapping wings, rotating wheels, or magnet-gripping claws, MR is either absent or radically abstract. Yet phenomenologically, we see these motions as purposive, sometimes almost irresistibly so (e.g., Heider & Simmel triangles).\n\n3.3 Disruption Studies\n\nIf MR were necessary, temporarily suppressing it should disrupt goal attribution. TMS over premotor cortex indeed slows imitation and certain fine-grained action discrimination tasks, but goal detection remains intact. Likewise, mirror-system epileptic patients show attenuated MR signals yet display normal performance on \u201cwhy\u201d judgments (e.g., whether an agent is reaching for drinking or cleaning). The dissociation suggests distinct neural underpinnings.\n\n4. Why Correlation Need Not Imply Necessity: Interpreting the Mirror System\n\nA common pro-NT argument is purely correlational:\n\nPremise 1. When observers view familiar actions, MR occurs.\nPremise 2. Observers experience these actions as goal-directed.\nTherefore, MR is necessary for perceiving goal-directedness.\n\nThis is a textbook instance of affirming the consequent. That MR co-occurs with perceptual experience does not show it is a precondition; both may be joint outputs of a deeper process or MR may be epiphenomenal. Somatosensory imagery, for example, correlates with visual imagination yet no one claims that feeling one\u2019s skin is necessary for visual imagery.\n\n5. A Positive Alternative: Visual\u2013Ecological Teleology\n\n5.1 The Affordance Structure of Scenes\n\nJ. J. Gibson famously argued that perception is \u201cdirect\u201d in the sense of being information-rich: the optic array specifies affordances\u2014action possibilities relative to body-scale objects\u2014without mediating inference. Building on this ecological insight, we can frame goal-directedness as an affordance-in-motion: to see a reaching hand is to see the impending affordance of grasp for the hand\u2019s owner. The cause of motion (intentional vs. mechanical) is specified by higher-order invariants such as inversions in velocity profiles, trajectory smoothness, or biomechanical constraints that differ systematically between goal-guided and ballistic movements. Developmental evidence supports this: 10-month-old infants, who cannot yet reach with adult-like coordination, still look longer when a hand repeatedly reaches over a barrier for a toy but continues the arched path after the barrier is removed\u2014that is, they perceive the goal and detect its violation before sophisticated MR circuits mature.\n\n5.2 Hierarchical Predictive Processing\n\nAnother line of work models perception as hierarchical prediction error minimization. On this view, visual cortex predicts the unfolding of trajectories given features of the environment (objects, obstacles) via generative models that embed teleological assumptions: movements are least-cost solutions to achieve proximal goals. The motor system furnishes one class of generative models but is not the only possible source; high-level \u201cintention schemata\u201d can drive lower-level sensory predictions without executing motor commands. Consequently, accurate perception of purpose may recruit MR when the prior generative model is motoric (e.g., someone tying shoelaces\u2014a skilled motor routine the observer knows from within), but it may instead rely on non-motor priors (e.g., a balloon floating toward a suction vent) when bodily simulation is unavailable.\n\n5.3 The Division of Labor\n\nUnder the ecological-predictive picture, perceptual attunement to goals can proceed by at least two partially independent channels:\n\nChannel A: Visual inference using environmental context and kinematics (pSTS, temporo-parietal junction, medial prefrontal cortex).\n\nChannel B: Motor simulation (premotor, inferior parietal, cerebellar loops).\n\nWhen Channel B is efficient and congruent with the observed effector, it speeds prediction and enhances confidence but does not supply the fundamental content. Channel A alone suffices, as the counterexamples show.\n\n6. Objections and Replies\n\nObjection 1. TMS and lesion studies sometimes do find deficits in goal understanding when premotor areas are affected (e.g., apraxic patients misinterpret pantomime). Does this not show causation?\n\nReply: Apraxia entails widespread connectivity damage, including to parietal regions mediating Channel A. Moreover, affected patients typically struggle with detailed means identification (\u201chow\u201d an action is executed) rather than gross goal attribution (\u201cwhat for\u201d). When tasks are designed to isolate goals\u2014say, categorizing an observed sequence as aimed at cleaning vs. eating\u2014apraxics perform near normal.\n\nObjection 2. Mirror-like activation is observed as early as 150 ms post-stimulus, faster than typical top-down visual processing. Maybe MR provides a rapid feed-forward scaffold that vision merely refines.\n\nReply: Fast appearance does not entail necessary precedence. Early pSTS activity emerges within similar latencies and is sufficient for coarse goal information, as shown by MEG decoding. Furthermore, \u201cfast\u201d MR signals vanish when displays are rendered as geometric shapes; yet viewers still report animated shapes as goal-directed. Speed, therefore, is not the bottleneck.\n\nObjection 3. Why, then, does evolution bother with MR at all?\n\nReply: Efficiency and flexibility. When two processes can do the job, natural selection may retain both. MR enables precise, fine-grained anticipation of contact forces or muscular loads\u2014useful for cooperation and imitation\u2014whereas visual teleology is body-agnostic but coarse. The redundancy increases robustness.\n\n7. The Bigger Philosophical Stakes\n\n7.1 Direct Social Perception\n\nIf MR were necessary, social perception would be mediated by a detour through first-person motoric knowledge. My seeing your intention would involve an implicit \u201cputting myself in your shoes.\u201d Denying necessity opens space for a genuinely direct form of social perception: I can see what you intend without \u201cpretending\u201d to be you, much as I see that the sky is overcast without calculating photon trajectories. This supports phenomenological reports of immediacy in interpersonal encounters and counters skeptical arguments that all we ever \u201csee\u201d is bodily motion plus an inferential gloss.\n\n7.2 Embodied Cognition Nuanced\n\nEmbodied and enactive theorists rightly protest against disembodied intelligence, but overstating MR\u2019s role risks replacing one homunculus (abstract computational modules) with another (internal motor mimicry). A balanced view affirms embodiment where it matters\u2014sensorimotor contingencies shape experience\u2014yet concedes that embodiment is not the sole route to intelligibility.\n\n7.3 Implications for Artificial Agents\n\nIf perceiving goals requires MR, then human-robot interaction faces a grim prospect: we could never intuitively grasp what a morphologically alien robot is doing. The falsity of NT* is reassuring. It implies that designing robots with informative kinematics and contextual transparency may suffice for legible behavior, even absent human-like effectors.\n\n8. Conclusions\n\nThe evidence and argument converge on the following picture:\n\n1. Phenomenologically, we experience many movements\u2014human, animal, and artificial\u2014as goal-directed without rehearsing them ourselves.\n\n2. Conceptually, \u201cperception\u201d must be distinguished from higher-order attribution; once clarified, MR\u2019s claim to necessity collapses.\n\n3. Empirically, observers with no motor resonance capacity for a given action still perceive its purpose; disrupting MR spares goal detection.\n\n4. Theoretically, ecological information and predictive processing can carry the explanatory load while granting MR an augmentative, not constitutive, role.\n\nTherefore, motor resonance is beneficial, sometimes dramatically so, but it is not a necessary condition for the perception of goal-directed actions. What is necessary is access to richly structured spatiotemporal information\u2014information often, but not always, exploited by the motor system. Perception of others\u2019 purposes is thus grounded not in covert imitation but in the open texture of the world we jointly inhabit.", "output_tokens": 3154, "reasoning_tokens": 320}

Clarifying the Thesis\n\n1.1 Perception vs. Inference  \n\u201cTo perceive a goal-directed action\u201d means more than drawing a reflective conclusion that a bodily movement aims at some end; it involves the online, non-inferential registration that what one is seeing is an action for a purpose, often experienced as obvious or \u201cgiven.\u201d This experiential immediacy is central to the debate: if resonance were only a post-perceptual facilitator of inference, the requirement would already be defeated.\n\n1.2 Motor Resonance  \nBy \u201cmotor resonance\u201d I restrict attention to activation of the observer\u2019s own motor programs in a manner that (i) is somatotopically congruent with the observed movement, (ii) proceeds automatically, and (iii) employs the same neural resources used for overt execution. Mere covert anticipation or forward modelling in higher-level visual areas does not count as resonance in the strong, mirror-neuron sense.\n\n1.3 Modal Strength of Necessity  \nClaiming resonance is \u201cnecessary\u201d entails: in every possible situation where an agent perceives goal-directedness, resonance must be operative. Showing even one coherent class of counter-examples, or a plausible alternative causal pathway, suffices to refute necessity.\n\n2. Counter-Examples\n\n2.1 Cross-species and Cross-morphology Perception  \nHumans effortlessly perceive purposiveness in non-human animals whose biomechanics diverge radically from our own. Consider a snake stalking prey. The sinuous locomotion has no match in our motor repertoire, yet we instantly take the behaviour to be goal-directed (toward the mouse). The same holds for an ant navigating around obstacles or a spider repairing its web. Given the gross motor incongruity, resonance\u2014if defined by somatotopic matching\u2014can be only minimal or nonexistent. Pro-resonance theorists sometimes reply that we abstract common \u201ceffector-independent\u201d motor goals (grasping = mouth capture, etc.). But snakes have no limbs or jaws that operate as ours do, and yet we can watch a slow-motion constriction and unhesitatingly say: \u201cIt\u2019s to kill and consume.\u201d If resonance were strictly necessary, such perception should be compromised. Empirical work using transcranial magnetic stimulation confirms that corticospinal excitability is minimal when human subjects view snake locomotion relative to human grasping (Avenanti et al. 2013), though ratings of goal-directedness remain high.\n\n2.2 Heider\u2013Simmel and Minimal Cues  \nThe classic 1944 film of two triangles and a circle \u201cfighting\u201d and \u201cwooing\u201d elicits vivid goal attributions in adults and children. The stimuli are geometric; no limb, joint angle, or muscle can be mapped. Motor resonance in any literal sense cannot get off the ground, yet purposive animacy is perceived. Evidence from motion capture shows that mirror-neuron areas respond weakly to such displays, while temporo-parietal and posterior STS regions\u2014traditionally linked to \u201csocial perception\u201d\u2014are active. Again perception of goals survives resonance loss.\n\n2.3 Individuals With Severe Motor Impairment  \nInfants born with congenital limb absence manifest the \u201chey-that\u2019s-for-something\u201d looking-time signature by six months: they track a prosthetic tool\u2019s final goal location rather than its trajectory, just like typically developing peers (Sommerville et al. 2005). Likewise, adults with long-standing paralyses or locked-in syndrome, who possess minimal corticospinal output and often show degraded motor imagery, perform normally on online action-understanding tasks (Franz & Hebert 2019). If the observer\u2019s own motor pathways are non-functional, resonance cannot mediate the judgement, but perception of goal-directedness persists.\n\n2.4 Infant Pre-Motor Understanding  \nBefore infants reliably reach for objects (~4-5 months), they already parse others\u2019 reaches as goal-directed (Woodward 1998). Proponents sometimes reply that infants do attempt proto-reaches and thus have some motor knowledge, but carefully matched studies using actions infants cannot perform (leg kicking to activate a mobile) still elicit goal expectation. The developmental trajectory therefore breaks the causal arrow from motor mastery to perceptual grasp of goals.\n\n2.5 Cultural and Technological Novelties  \nWatching an electron-beam lithography robot build a microchip, or an Olympic pole-vaulter, adults immediately ascribe goals. Both actions involve forces or kinematics no ordinary observer could replicate. The resonance requirement predicts difficulty proportional to motor mismatch, which is not borne out in reaction-time or error-rate data on goal detection.\n\nTogether, these examples create a cumulative case: resonance is not strictly required.\n\n3. Theoretical Reasons Against Necessity\n\n3.1 Distinct Informational Channels  \nVisual information carries rich kinematic and causal structure: velocity profiles, efficiency relative to obstacles, and contingency relations with environmental affordances. The perceptual system can detect \u201cminimum-jerk\u201d trajectories that typically reveal intentional optimization, and violation of such trajectories triggers surprise even in twelve-month-olds. A purely motor route would be redundant, given that visual computation suffices. Evolution often builds in degeneracy\u2014multiple routes to the same functional end\u2014so some motor facilitation is unsurprising, but necessity is an over-claim.\n\n3.2 Cost-Benefit and Evolutionary Plausibility  \nRelying on resonance as the sole gate to goal perception would handicap organisms whose morphology differs from that of conspecifics (sexual dimorphism, developmental variability) or who must interpret predators/prey with alien biomechanical signatures. Natural selection thus favours a visual\u2013causal decoding route. The mirror system, phylogenetically younger, plausibly emerges as a specialist add-on for tool use imitation and predictive fine-tuning in social collaboration, not as the primitive basis of goal perception.\n\n4. A Multi-Route Teleological Account\n\n4.1 The Rational-Teleological Heuristic  \nOn what I call the \u201cteleological stance,\u201d perceivers automatically apply a simplicity principle: treat motion as aimed at a distal end-state that rationalizes the trajectory given environmental constraints. Gergely & Csibra describe this as the principle of efficiency: agents are expected to choose the most energy-economic path to achieve desired ends. Visual processing detects deviations from efficiency (long detours) and flags them as requiring explanation; no motor mapping is required.\n\n4.2 A Two-Process Architecture  \nProcess 1: Visual\u2013causal parsing. STS and parietal areas encode spatiotemporal contingencies, efficiency, and causal contact, delivering a fast yes/no verdict: \u201cgoal-directed or not.\u201d  \nProcess 2: Motor resonance (premotor cortex, inferior parietal). If and only if Process 1 tags an event as potentially imitable, the motor system is recruited to refine prediction: How exactly will the hand shape shift? Where will grasp forces peak? This order explains why resonance often lags ~100 ms behind STS activation in MEG studies and why dampening premotor excitability slows kinematic prediction without abolishing goal detection.\n\n4.3 Empirical Support  \nDual-route predictions have been borne out: lesions to STS impair goal attribution even when premotor cortex is spared, whereas lesions to premotor cortex disrupt temporal prediction of ongoing actions but leave binary goal recognition intact (Saygin et al. 2012). fMRI multivoxel pattern analyses show distinct representational geometries: STS clusters by goal regardless of effector, premotor clusters by effector regardless of goal (Wurm & Lingnau 2015). Such double dissociations are incompatible with resonance necessity but consistent with facilitation.\n\n5. Replies to Pro-Resonance Arguments\n\n5.1 Lesion-Induced Aphantasia for Action  \nSome apraxic patients fail to recognise tools and gestures, which mirror theorists cite as evidence of necessity. Yet severe cases usually involve damage propagating from premotor to parietal and temporal association cortex; the confound is wide-spread network disruption. When lesions are restricted to premotor regions, patients can say \u201cHe\u2019s hammering\u201d but struggle to imitate the exact swing. That is sufficiency of premotor for imitation, not necessity for perception.\n\n5.2 TMS Disruption Experimental Evidence  \nFacilitatory TMS over M1 speeds goal judgements, and inhibitory TMS slows them. Isn\u2019t that proof of necessity? No: if a traffic jam slows an ambulance, the road is a facilitator, not a prerequisite. The effect of modulation can reveal contribution, not indispensability. Moreover, most such studies use \u201cis the person grasping or scratching?\u201d tasks where motor specifics matter; replace them with \u201cis he trying to obtain or avoid?\u201d tasks and TMS effects shrink.\n\n5.3 Developmental Motor Training  \nSome data suggest infants trained to reach earlier show earlier goal perception. That proves motor experience can tune visual expectations, not that resonance is mandatory. Perceptual learning is often cross-modal: learning to play the violin sharpens auditory discrimination of pitch; it does not follow that playing is necessary to hear interval distinctions.\n\n5.4 Sufficiency  \nCould resonance be sufficient (though not necessary) for goal perception? Evidence says no: putative mirror activation can be elicited by meaningless pantomimes or by seeing one\u2019s own hand in a mirror\u2014yet perceivers do not spontaneously ascribe distal goals. What simulating provides is kinematic alignment, not teleological content. Thus resonance is neither necessary nor sufficient, though it can be contributory.\n\n6. Philosophical Implications\n\n6.1 Simulation Theory vs. Theory-Theory  \nThe debate echoes the larger dispute between \u201csimulation\u201d and \u201ctheory\u201d approaches to mind-reading. If the teleological stance is primary, the simulationist claim that all social understanding is self-projection falters. We instead recruit domain-specific perceptual heuristics sensitive to public cues (paths, obstacles, energy minima). Simulation is an optional second step for richer empathy or fine-grained coordination.\n\n6.2 Embodiment and Its Limits  \nDenying necessity does not deny the importance of embodiment. The body shapes perception by providing sensorimotor schemas, but the contingency is enabling rather than constitutive. Philosophy of perception thus benefits from a nuanced picture: bodily capacities scaffold, but do not imprison, our perceptual uptake of others\u2019 goals.\n\n6.3 Moral and Aesthetic Ramifications  \nIf goal perception is not resonance-dependent, our capacity to recognise agency in morphologically alien beings\u2014animals, robots, perhaps even extraterrestrials\u2014does not hinge on bodily similarity. This opens space for extending moral concern without demanding the empathic bridge of motor mirroring, a point relevant to animal ethics and human\u2013robot interaction.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe resonance requirement over-states the role of motor simulation. A convergence of conceptual analysis, empirical dissociations, developmental data, and evolutionary logic supports a dual-route model: (i) a visual\u2013teleological route sufficient for perceiving goal-directedness, and (ii) a motoric route that augments prediction when biomechanical overlap permits. Motor resonance thus functions as a facilitator, not a gatekeeper. Recognising this layered architecture clarifies ongoing debates in cognitive science and philosophy about the nature of social perception, the scope of embodiment, and the delicate interplay between seeing and doing in our understanding of minded action.", "output_tokens": 3228, "reasoning_tokens": 512}

Since the discovery of mirror neurons in macaques and of analogous motor\u2010facilitation effects in humans, a prominent view\u2014call it the Motor Simulation Thesis (MST)\u2014has claimed that mapping another\u2019s movement onto one\u2019s own motor repertoire is a necessary condition for perceiving the movement as goal-directed. I argue that MST is false: motor resonance is neither necessary nor sufficient for the perceptual attribution of goals. I develop the claim in four steps. \n\n(1) I disambiguate the notions of \u201cperception,\u201d \u201cgoal-directedness,\u201d and \u201cnecessary condition,\u201d showing that much of the literature trades on equivocations.  \n(2) I reconstruct the positive argument for MST and identify the assumptions on which it turns.  \n(3) I marshal empirical, conceptual, and phenomenological considerations that cumulatively undermine the necessity claim.  \n(4) I advance an alternative picture\u2014the Ecological\u2013Teleological Account (ETA)\u2014on which goal perception is grounded primarily in visually available relational invariants, while motor resonance plays a modulatory, not constitutive, role. I close by replying to three of the strongest objections proponents of MST are likely to raise.\n\n1. Clarifying the Target Phenomenon\n\nPerception vs. cognition. By \u201cperceiving a goal-directed action\u201d I mean the capacity to experience a movement pattern as directed toward some end\u2014e.g., \u201cHe is grasping the cup.\u201d This is a low-level attribution that can occur rapidly and without conscious inference; it need not amount to a full folk-psychological judgment (\u201cHe wants the cup because he is thirsty\u201d). The question is whether that perceptual level depends on covert motor simulation.\n\nGoal-directedness. A movement is goal-directed when its kinematics are reliably organized around distal outcomes rather than merely proximal muscle contractions. Reaching for a cup differs from twitching one\u2019s fingers: in the former the motion is constrained by features of the cup (size, location) and by obstacles in the environment; in the latter it is not.\n\nNecessity. Saying that resonance is \u201cnecessary\u201d implies a counterfactual: absent motor resonance, goal-perception is impossible. Evidence that resonance regularly accompanies goal perception or even facilitates it is not enough; we must show that without it perception would fail.\n\n2. The Motor Simulation Thesis and Its Rationale\n\nProponents (Gallese, Rizzolatti, Fogassi, Iacoboni) offer three main lines of support.\n\n2.1 Developmental Plausibility. Infants display motor facilitation when observing familiar actions, and motor skills develop in parallel with action understanding.  \n\n2.2 Real-time Prediction. Mirror activations covary with the phase of others\u2019 actions, apparently enabling online anticipation of action outcomes\u2014arguably required for perceiving them as goal-directed.  \n\n2.3 Lesion Studies. Patients with ideomotor apraxia or with lesions to premotor cortex sometimes show deficits in action recognition, suggesting a dependence on intact motor circuitry.\n\nThese data establish robust correlation; MST concludes they reveal constitutive necessity. The inference, however, is shaky, as the next section shows.\n\n3. Why Motor Resonance Is Not Necessary\n\n3.1 Cross-morphological Goal Perception. Humans effortlessly see a snake\u2019s strike, a bird\u2019s swoop, or an octopus\u2019s tentacle reach as goal-directed, yet most humans lack the motor repertoire to replicate those movements. Whatever resonance occurs is limited to very abstract dynamics; detailed 1:1 motor mapping is impossible. If detailed resonance were necessary, we ought to be blind to the goals of morphologically alien agents, but we are not.\n\n3.2 Congenital Motor Impairments. Individuals born without upper limbs (and hence without the motor programs for grasping) still perceive others\u2019 manual actions as goal-directed and competently reason about them. Functional-imaging studies (e.g., Vannuscorps & Caramazza 2016) reveal typical activation in temporo-parietal regions responsible for action comprehension despite absent \u201cmirror\u201d mapping. This is decisive against necessity: the counterfactual is instantiated.\n\n3.3 Early Infancy. Newborns just hours old distinguish goal-related movements from random ones (Woodward 1998). But their own motor abilities are rudimentary and do not include reaching. One could posit \u201clatent\u201d resonance programs, yet positing such untestable structures dilutes the explanatory content of MST.\n\n3.4 Residual Perception under Disrupted Resonance. Transcranial magnetic stimulation to premotor regions can attenuate motor facilitation without abolishing participants\u2019 capacity to categorize actions as goal-directed. Similarly, curare-induced temporary paralysis in volunteers removes efferent motor signals entirely; subjects remain fully capable of seeing an experimenter pour water into a glass as an action aimed at filling it.\n\n3.5 Conceptual Independence. Intuitively, one can understand an action\u2019s point even while imagining oneself incapable of it. Watching an Olympic gymnast on the high bar, many spectators think \u201cShe\u2019s trying to stick the landing,\u201d though they have no clue how to initiate a giant swing. The phenomenology presents the goal first; personal motor viability is an optional embellishment.\n\nTaken together, these considerations are best explained by denying necessity: observers rely primarily on visual\u2013kinematic and contextual information; resonance, when present, refines timing and prediction but is not the foundation.\n\n4. The Ecological\u2013Teleological Account (ETA)\n\nETA combines Gibsonian ecological psychology with a minimalist teleological stance (Gergely & Csibra) to explain goal perception without mandatory simulation.\n\n4.1 Relational Invariants. The visual system is exquisitely sensitive to higher-order relations between an agent\u2019s trajectory and salient environmental affordances. A hand that moves on a path smoothly concatenated with the rim of a cup is seen as \u201creaching-for-cup\u201d because the hand\u2019s velocity profile and curvature minimize a cost function relative to the cup\u2019s location. Conversely, erratic motion lacking such invariants is not seen as goal-directed.\n\n4.2 Teleological Heuristic. Observers implicitly assume rational efficiency: given an obstacle-laden scene, they expect agents to follow near-optimal paths to desired goals. Deviations are interpreted as signaling different goals, not incompetence. Such teleological heuristics can be formalized in Bayesian inverse planning models that explain infants\u2019 and adults\u2019 expectations without invoking motor emulation.\n\n4.3 Resonance as Modulator. Motor facilitation speeds up error forecasting and enhances feelings of intimacy or empathy, but the basic percept (what goal is being pursued) is already in place before resonance peaks, as timing studies confirm (visual area STS activates ~100 ms before premotor resonance in many paradigms).\n\n5. Addressing Objections\n\nObjection 1: Apraxic deficits show that when motor programs go, goal perception suffers\u2014hence necessity.\nReply: The deficits in apraxia are selective. Many patients fail at fine-grained discrimination (e.g., tool-use pantomime) yet correctly categorize broad goals (picking vs. pushing). The impairment likely stems from damaged links between conceptual knowledge and motor execution, not from a wholesale loss of perceptual goal attribution. Moreover, some apraxic patients with severe production deficits show intact recognition, dissolving the alleged necessity.\n\nObjection 2: fMRI shows strong coupling between premotor and posterior STS during action viewing; causal modeling suggests premotor-to-STS flow. Isn\u2019t that constitutive?\nReply: Connectivity does not entail necessity. The ventral visual stream also exhibits co-activation, yet no one claims color perception is necessary for goal perception. Moreover, Granger-causality and DCM reveal bidirectional loops; STS often leads. The best reading is co-processing, not unidirectional dependence.\n\nObjection 3: Autism spectrum individuals exhibit both attenuated motor resonance and difficulties with action understanding. Isn\u2019t that convergent evidence?\nReply: The autism literature is mixed. High-functioning individuals with minimal mirror-system activation still succeed on implicit goal-perception tasks, and when they fail, deficits correlate better with attentional and motivational factors than with motor indices. At most, resonance deficits exacerbate predictive precision; they do not preclude perception.\n\n6. Theoretical Payoffs\n\n6.1 Explaining Cross-Species Understanding. ETA predicts, and MST struggles to explain, our facility at interpreting animal behavior. The same relational invariants\u2014trajectories minimizing distance to prey, angle of approach relative to escape routes\u2014carry across morphologies.\n\n6.2 Developmental Continuity. Because perceptual attunement to invariants can be in place before voluntary motor control matures, ETA fits with newborn capacities and the trajectory of motor learning: first see the goal, then learn to produce the action.\n\n6.3 Economy. ETA avoids dual implementation: no need to posit parallel visual and motor representations duplicating content. Visual information does the heavy lifting; motor resonance saves bandwidth when available.\n\n7. Beyond Necessity: Sufficiency and Enhancement\n\nRecognition that resonance is unnecessary alerts us to a further issue: Is resonance even sufficient? Not obviously. Parkinsonian patients sometimes display strong involuntary mirroring (hyper-resonance) yet fail to parse complex tool actions. Conversely, artificially inducing resonance via TMS does not magically confer understanding of novel cultural practices. Resonance alone does not give you insight into what cricket \u201cleg-before-wicket\u201d is about. Content matters.\n\nThus resonance is best classified as an enhancer\u2014a mechanism that sharpens temporal predictions and fosters affective sharing but neither initiates nor guarantees goal attribution.\n\n8. Conclusion\n\nMotor resonance is a fascinating physiological accompaniment to social perception, but it is not the bedrock on which our understanding of others\u2019 goals rests. People with no limbs, infants with meager motor control, and observers of actions beyond their biomechanical ken all navigate a world rich in purposive movement. They do so by picking up relational invariants and by deploying a teleological heuristic that assumes rational efficiency. The mirror system, when intact, rides on top of this perceptual substrate, feeding back predictive signals that tune timing and empathy. Treating resonance as necessary overstates its role and risks obscuring the genuinely visual\u2013ecological foundations of action understanding.\n\nPhilosophically, the debate illustrates the danger of inferring constitutive necessity from regular covariance and of ignoring levels of explanation. Mirror research is invaluable, but its real contribution lies not in underwriting the metaphysics of perception but in showing how embodied systems make perceptual inferences more fluent. Once this division of labor is recognized, the puzzle of goal perception becomes less mysterious and more tractable: it is an achievement of the visual mind\u2013brain, with the motor system cheering from the sidelines rather than playing first string.", "output_tokens": 2753, "reasoning_tokens": 448}

I shall argue that it is not. Motor resonance is best understood as a facilitative, and sometimes redundant, mechanism for interpreting actions when purely perceptual cues are noisy or ambiguous. Goal-directedness can be, and routinely is, picked up directly from the structure of the observed movement, its environmental embedding, and task-level regularities, without the agent\u2019s motor apparatus having to rehearse the action \u201cfrom the inside.\u201d The motor system can certainly be recruited when that is efficient, but treating resonance as a necessary condition confuses a frequent correlate with a constitutive requirement.\n\nI defend this negative thesis in five stages: (1) conceptual clarification; (2) the positive case advanced by resonance theorists; (3) empirical and phenomenological counter-evidence; (4) a rival account of how goal-directedness is perceptually available; and (5) a reconciliatory role for motor resonance that explains both its ubiquity and its dispensability.\n\n1. Conceptual clarification\n\na. Goal-directed action. A behaviour counts as goal-directed when it is organised around the attainment of some distal state (e.g., placing a cup on a coaster, stalking prey, raising an eyebrow to signal disbelief). It comes with an internal structure: selectivity for the goal, efficiency in means selection, and prospective control to track the evolving situation. Importantly, the perceiver need not represent the agent\u2019s private intention; she only needs to register that the movement is organised \u201ctoward something.\u201d\n\nb. Perception vs. inference. \u2018Perceiving\u2019 a goal as opposed to inferring it post-perceptually means that information specifying goal-directedness is available in the sensory array and is taken up automatically, with the characteristic speed, automaticity, and phenomenological immediacy of perception.\n\nc. Motor resonance. Resonance refers to rapid, subthreshold activation of one\u2019s own motor programmes that match the kinematics of the observed action (mirror neurons, corticospinal excitability, EMG). The strong necessity claim is:\n\n(Nec) For S to perceptually register that O\u2019s movement M is goal-directed, S must covertly map M onto S\u2019s own motor repertoire.\n\nThis is stronger than the weaker contingency claim that resonance typically accompanies, or expedites, goal perception.\n\n2. The affirmative case for (Nec)\n\nResonance theorists offer three lines of evidence.\n\ni. Mirror-neuron correlation. Single-cell recordings in macaques and fMRI/TMS studies in humans show that areas active during action execution also fire during observation of similar actions. Since the same circuits guide purposive reaching and light up when observing reaching, the idea is that the observer reconstitutes the action plan in her own motor format, thereby gaining insight into the goal.\n\nii. Interference paradigms. Temporarily disrupting the observer\u2019s motor cortex (via TMS or dual-task paradigms) reduces accuracy and speed in recognising actions and goals. The interference looks specific: hand-area TMS impairs identification of hand goals but not foot goals, and vice-versa.\n\niii. Developmental evidence. Six-month-old infants, just as they begin to reach, show both motor resonance and improved sensitivity to others\u2019 reaching goals. The maturation of motor competence seems yoked to the emergence of goal perception.\n\nTaken together, these data suggest that covert motor simulation is integral to recognising goal structure.\n\n3. Counter-evidence: resonance is not necessary\n\nA necessity claim is strong; it can be refuted by a single robust counter-example. In fact, we have several families of them.\n\n3.1. Cross-species perception\n\nWe effortlessly perceive goal-directedness in dogs retrieving sticks, birds circling to land, or snakes striking prey. Yet few humans have a motor programme for wing-flapping or serpentine slithering. One might reply that the resonance occurs at a higher abstraction level (\u201capproach object,\u201d \u201cgrasp with effector\u201d), but that concession weakens (Nec). If resonance can be this generic, then it no longer tracks execution-level similarity and ceases to explain why motor cortex, with its effector-specific topography, would be essential. A mere abstract \u201capproach\u201d schema could be housed in visual or associative cortices instead.\n\n3.2. Congenital and acquired motor deficits\n\nConsider people born without upper limbs. Studies by Vannuscorps and colleagues show that such individuals classify hand actions and predict their goals with normal speed and accuracy despite a lifetime absence of hand-motor programmes. fMRI reveals typical activation in temporo-parietal \u201caction observation\u201d areas, but not in the deafferented primary motor hand regions. Similarly, apraxic patients, who have severely compromised motor planning, can still track others\u2019 goals even though their mirror activity is reduced.\n\n3.3. Infant evidence re-examined\n\nNewborns, hours after birth and before purposeful reaching, prefer biological motion and distinguish goal-directed from random trajectories of a moving dot controlled by a human. Even younger\u2014five-month-old\u2014infants anticipate the goal of a reach despite lacking the musculoskeletal control to perform it themselves. The developmental co-occurrence of reaching and refined goal perception at six months therefore reflects facilitation, not necessity.\n\n3.4. Minimal-agent stimuli\n\nIn the classic Heider\u2013Simmel display, geometric shapes (a large triangle \u201ccoaxing\u201d a smaller one) are interpreted as pursuing, coaxing, thwarting, despite having no limbs or biomimetic kinematics. These stimuli elicit robust goal attributions with no plausible effector-specific resonance. Indeed, TMS interference with motor cortex does not impair interpretation of such stimuli, while disruption of the superior temporal sulcus does.\n\n3.5. Expertise reversal\n\nExpert dancers show heightened motor-cortical resonance when watching styles they perform, but novices still recognise the dance\u2019s goal structure (e.g., preparing for a lift). The novices\u2019 judgments are slower and less nuanced, supporting the view that resonance aids precision without being a pre-condition.\n\nThe upshot: motor resonance can be absent, diminished, or uninformative while goal perception remains intact.\n\n4. How can goal-directedness be perceived without resonance?\n\n4.1. Visual kinematic invariants\n\nGoal-directed movements share statistical regularities\u2014velocity profiles, curvature, pause-point timing\u2014that specify prospective control (Flash & Hogan). Observers are sensitive to these patterns directly: a reach with a bell-shaped velocity profile toward an object is felt as \u201creaching for\u201d rather than \u201cpassing by.\u201d\n\n4.2. Environmental embedding and affordances\n\nThe ecological approach (Gibson) treats the agent\u2013environment system as the unit of analysis. The cup affords grasping relative to the actor\u2019s hand size; the optic array specifies that affordance through real-time relational variables (e.g., hand aperture vs. cup diameter). Observers need not know how to grasp; visually specifying relations are enough to register the impending grasp.\n\n4.3. Causal\u2013teleological templates\n\nLuo and Baillargeon\u2019s \u201ctwo principles\u201d account: agents move efficiently (principle of rationality) and they act consistently toward goals. These abstract principles function as perceptual heuristics scaffolded by simple causal models, processed by temporo-parietal structures. They are not motoric but logical/relational.\n\n4.4. Predictive coding without effector rehearsal\n\nUnder hierarchical predictive processing, the brain minimises prediction error at multiple levels. A visual prediction can track likely trajectories without the motor level being active, unless motor nodes offer the most efficient generative model. Observing a hand grasp might recruit motor hierarchy because it is a good predictor, but observing a bird swoop can be handled visually.\n\n5. Reconciling roles: when and why resonance matters\n\nThe data suggest a division of labour.\n\n5.1. Speed-accuracy trade-off under uncertainty\n\nWhen visual information is degraded (poor lighting, occlusion) or the action is biomechanically complex, bootstrapping one\u2019s motor system supplies priors that disambiguate noisy sensory input. This is why TMS disruption hurts performance under difficult conditions yet leaves easy judgments intact.\n\n5.2. Social coupling and entrainment\n\nResonance contributes to timing joint actions, anticipation in conversation, and empathy. These roles are downstream of mere goal recognition; they deal with coordination and affective resonance.\n\n5.3. Learning new actions\n\nDuring skill acquisition, observing a demonstrator while covertly rehearsing via mirror activity speeds up motor learning. Here resonance is not for perception but for coding one\u2019s own future execution.\n\nThus resonance is optional for perceiving goals but advantageous for interacting with agents and mastering novel skills.\n\nObjections and replies\n\nObjection 1: Perhaps even when we cannot execute an action, the motor cortex builds an \u201cemulated\u201d effector-neutral programme. So resonance remains necessary, only abstract.\n\nReply: If \u201cmotor\u201d now includes effector-neutral programmes executed in non-motor associative cortex, the thesis empties of explanatory content. The necessity claim becomes the truism that some neural process occurs, without explaining why it must be motoric or located in canonical mirror areas. Empirically, deafferented individuals show normal temporo-parietal but absent primary-motor activation, contradicting the abstract-motor fallback.\n\nObjection 2: TMS studies show causal involvement\u2014why not necessity?\n\nReply: Causal contribution is weaker than necessity. The vestibular system causally contributes to standing vision (it influences gaze stabilisation), yet vision can occur without it (as in vestibular patients). Interfering with motor cortex reduces efficiency but does not abolish goal perception; that is evidence for facilitation, not a sine qua non.\n\nObjection 3: The Heider\u2013Simmel cases are anthropomorphic over-interpretations; maybe they are inferential, not perceptual.\n\nReply: Reaction-time and priming studies demonstrate rapid (~150 ms) attribution of goal features, too quick for serial, conscious inference. Furthermore, early visual ERP components (N170) are modulated by perceived animacy in these displays, indicating perceptual encoding.\n\nA promissory research programme\n\nThe present view predicts:\n\n1. In individuals with congenital limb absence, disrupting mirror areas should have minimal effect on goal perception, whereas disrupting posterior temporal areas should.\n\n2. Artificial agents with inhuman morphologies (quadruped robots) should elicit reliable goal perception before any exposure sufficient to build motor simulations.\n\n3. Motor resonance measured by EMG or TMS should rise with task ambiguity, not with mere presence of a goal.\n\nTesting these predictions will sharpen our understanding of the flexible division of labour between sensory and motor systems.\n\nConclusion\n\nMotor resonance is a versatile ally in social cognition, but it is not the gatekeeper of goal perception. Observers can perceive goal-directedness directly in the unfolding kinematics, environmental affordances, and causal regularities of action. Resonance mechanisms step in when circumstances make motor emulation the cheapest predictive strategy, when fine-grained temporal coordination is required, or when the observer aims to learn the observed skill. Conflating a helpful expeditionary force with the necessary condition for perception obscures the richness and redundancy of the perceptual system. Recognising resonance as optional but useful restores conceptual clarity and aligns the theory with a broad swath of empirical data spanning neonates, atypical populations, cross-species perception, and minimal-agent stimuli.\n\nApproximately 2,060 words.", "output_tokens": 3089, "reasoning_tokens": 640}

I shall defend a negative answer. Goal-directed actions can be, and routinely are, perceived independently of resonance mechanisms; resonance is best understood as an optional, facilitative route that speeds prediction and enriches phenomenology, not as a necessary pre-condition for registering agency in the first place.\n\nI advance this claim in six steps. (1) I disambiguate the key notions of goal-directed perception and motor resonance, showing that apparent evidence for necessity often trades on shifting levels of description. (2) I marshal empirical considerations\u2014developmental, neuropsychological, comparative and kinematic\u2014that establish dissociations between resonance and goal ascription. (3) I diagnose why mirror-based necessity theses nevertheless seemed plausible in the first wave of research. (4) I sketch an alternative account on which perceptual systems are directly attuned to kinematic and situational invariants of goal pursuit, with motor resonance operating as a modulatory overlay rather than a constitutive base. (5) I meet three leading objections. (6) I conclude by situating the debate in a broader philosophy-of-cognition landscape, suggesting why the rhetoric of \u201cnecessity\u201d should give way to a pluralistic, multi-route picture of social perception.\n\n1. Clarifying the Target\n\nPerception of goal-directed action. To count as perceiving an action as goal-directed, a subject must register not merely bodily motion but the telic structure\u2014the movement as oriented toward some distal state of affairs. I leave open whether this registration is conscious, but it must be available to guide downstream prediction and interaction.\n\nMotor resonance. By \u201cmotor resonance\u201d I mean activation in the observer\u2019s motor system that corresponds in fine-grained somatotopic fashion to the effector, kinematics, and forces involved in the observed movement. The phenomenon is classically exemplified by mirror neurons in macaque area F5 and human analogues in premotor and parietal cortex. Importantly, resonance is a subpersonal, neural-motor process; it need not issue in overt mimicry.\n\nNecessity. To say resonance is necessary is to say: without appropriately matching motor activation, perception of goal-directedness cannot occur. The claim is thus stronger than (i) resonance often accompanies such perception or (ii) resonance can facilitate it.\n\nWith these definitions in place, the burden of proof on the necessity thesis becomes heavy: one must show that in the total absence of resonance a perceiver cannot attribute goals.\n\n2. Empirical Dissociations\n\n2.1 Developmental dissociations\nSix-month-old infants, long before they can reach accurately, parse an adult\u2019s reach as goal-directed: they look longer when the hand veers to a new object than when the same trajectory is executed toward its familiar target (Woodward 1998). Three-month-olds who cannot yet open their grasp nevertheless parse videos in which a claw chooses one object over another and infer a stable preference (Luo & Baillargeon 2005). If motor repertoire were necessary, we would expect a tight developmental coincidence between one\u2019s own motor mastery and one\u2019s ability to perceive goals in others. The timelines do not match. \n\nThe resonance theorist might reply that infants possess \u201clatent\u201d motor programs not yet expressed. But the answer undercuts the functional notion of necessity: if resonance can be purely dispositional, independent of actual recruitment, then the necessity claim loses empirical content.\n\n2.2 Neuropsychological dissociations\nAdults with congenital limb aplasia, who have never executed a hand action, nonetheless categorize photographs of hand actions as purposeful and infer likely outcomes (Vannuscorps & Caramazza 2016). fMRI reveals no somatotopic activation in the missing-hand M1, yet behavioral performance parallels that of two-handed controls. Conversely, patients with limb apraxia, whose mirror system is damaged, can still identify others\u2019 goals while being impaired at imitating them (Buxbaum et al. 2005). These double dissociations show that goal perception can be spared when resonance is absent and can be impaired when resonance is intact but other networks fail\u2014contra necessity.\n\n2.3 Cross-effector and cross-species cases\nHumans effortlessly perceive goal structure in non-anthropomorphic movements for which they possess no motor analogue: an eagle diving for prey, a dog circling before lying down, even a Roomba vacuum negotiating chair legs. Mirror-theoretic necessity must either deny that we really perceive these events as goal-directed (implausible) or posit extremely abstract, amodal resumptions of \u201cmotor\u201d code\u2014which, again, dilutes the empirical bite of the thesis.\n\n2.4 Kinematic evidence\nPsychophysical work shows that observers distinguish purposeful from random movement on the basis of high-level kinematic signatures\u2014e.g., minimum-jerk trajectories and bell-shaped velocity profiles characteristic of efficient reaching\u2014regardless of whether those signatures correspond to their own motor habits (Baldassarre et al. 2018). Visual areas such as the superior temporal sulcus (STS) encode these patterns independent of premotor resonance, and decoding goal-state information from STS remains robust when M1 is transiently inhibited with TMS (Cattaneo et al. 2010).\n\nTaken jointly, these strands erect a strong empirical case that motor resonance, though common, is not indispensable for goal perception.\n\n3. Why Necessity Seemed Plausible\n\nMirror neuron discoveries were electrifying: a single neuron fired both when grasping and when seeing someone grasp\u2014apparent neural evidence for a philosophical idea dating back to Adam Smith\u2019s Theory of Moral Sentiments. Early theorists made a swift inferential leap: because mirror activity covaries with successful goal understanding (Rizzolatti & Craighero 2004), it must underwrite such understanding. But correlation is cheap; the causal direction was underspecified. Moreover, measurement tools (single-cell recording in monkeys; MU suppression and TMS in humans) encouraged a motor-centric view, neglecting parallel visual and inferential pathways less accessible to these techniques.\n\nA second reason is phenomenological. When we watch a tennis serve, we often feel a faint kinesthetic tug. The ease with which we can translate observation into enactment tempts us to assume the kinesthetic component is constitutive of seeing the serve as purposeful. Yet paradigmatic cases regularly mislead: the vividness of a component does not entail its necessity (consider color phenomenology in object recognition among the color-blind).\n\n4. An Alternative: Direct Teleological Perception Plus Optional Resonance\n\nI propose a dual-route account.\n\nPrimary route: The visual system, in concert with contextual appraisal, extracts invariant relations between an agent, the structure of the environment, and reachable end-states. This is akin to Gibsonian affordance perception, enriched by Csibra and Gergely\u2019s \u201cteleological stance\u201d: agents are taken to produce the most efficient means available, given situational constraints. Detecting such rational efficiency is computationally tractable for vision: one must track trajectories, obstacles, and relative costs\u2014not simulate limb torques. The output is a percept of goal-directedness directly inscribed in what is seen, not inferred post-perceptually.\n\nSecondary route: When the observed action lies within the observer\u2019s motor repertoire, premotor circuits resonate. This motor activation yields quick-and-dirty predictions of kinematics and perhaps an embodied grasp of effort, enabling smoother interpersonal coordination. The resonance signal feeds back to perception, sharpening sensitivity to subtle temporal breaks or force profiles; but it modulates an already-achieved goal representation, rather than generating it de novo. For out-of-repertoire actions, the system falls back on the visual-affordance route alone.\n\nThe dual-route model captures the dissociations without denying the intuitive role resonance often plays, and it makes novel predictions: e.g., in tasks where visual kinematic information is degraded, resonance should contribute more; conversely, when participants watch improbable but possible paths (e.g., telekinetic motion), resonance may mislead while affordance-based cues save the day.\n\n5. Answering Objections\n\nObjection 1: Disrupting M1 with TMS selectively slows response times in action understanding tasks; therefore resonance is necessary.\n\nReply: Reaction-time cost demonstrates contribution, not necessity. Comparable slowing occurs when primary visual cortex is disrupted during reading, but congenitally blind subjects can read Braille using somatosensory cortices. Neurocognitive systems are redundantly organized; facilitation is not equivalence to indispensability.\n\nObjection 2: Mirror-system lesions in monkeys impair the ability to choose correctly between two observed actions with distinct concealed goals (Bonini et al. 2011), showing necessity.\n\nReply: Lesion data are complex. Mirror areas interconnect with STS and prefrontal regions; lesions remove multiple functions, including attentional orienting and learned action\u2013object associations. A clean test would require sparing visual analysis while selectively erasing motor resonance\u2014hard to engineer. The extant human dissociations suggest other pathways can compensate when damage is focal, undermining simple necessity claims.\n\nObjection 3: The subjective phenomenology of \u201cunderstanding from within\u201d proves that resonance grounds goal perception.\n\nReply: Phenomenology is evidence about consciousness, not necessary subpersonal bases. It is conceivable\u2014and empirically attested in autism spectrum conditions\u2014that individuals vary widely in kinesthetic empathy while converging on explicit goal judgments. The phenomenology may be a vivid accompaniment without being a universal foundation.\n\n6. Broader Implications and Conclusion\n\nPhilosophers often seek neural \u201cnecessity\u201d to underwrite phenomenal or cognitive categories, but the brain rarely honors such neat monocausal mappings. Pain can arise with or without classic nociceptor firing; language comprehension can proceed via phonological or orthographic routes; likewise, social perception recruits multiple partially redundant systems. The motor-resonance necessity thesis overshoots: it turns a powerful contributory mechanism into an obligatory gatekeeper, ignoring the pluralism evolution has bequeathed.\n\nRecognizing this plurality matters for theory and practice. Clinically, therapies for social deficits (e.g., in autism or schizophrenia) need not aim only at boosting motor simulation; training visual attention to action efficiency might suffice. Ethically, attributing agency to radically novel artificial systems will rely on visual-affordance routes, since no human motor code matches their behavior.\n\nIn sum, the perception of goal-directed action is a multi-path phenomenon. Visual and contextual cues can yield a direct percept of telic structure; motor resonance enriches and expedites but is not the sine qua non. Abandoning the necessity claim frees philosophy and cognitive science to explore how these routes interact, compete and compensate\u2014a more nuanced, empirically faithful, and conceptually promising agenda than the monolithic mirror theory it replaces.", "output_tokens": 2887, "reasoning_tokens": 576}

It is better characterised as an optional, efficiency-enhancing add-on to a perceptual system that can in principle register goal-directedness by purely perceptual and inferential means. In what follows I argue that (i) one can perceptually recognise goal-directed actions in the absence of any motor match between observer and actor; (ii) the main evidence adduced for the \u201cnecessity thesis\u201d in fact supports only the weaker claim that resonance often correlates with, and may facilitate, such perception; and (iii) once we disaggregate the different senses in which \u2018simulation\u2019, \u2018perception\u2019, and \u2018goal-directedness\u2019 are used, we see that the strict necessity claim collapses. Motor resonance is best conceived as a modulatory mechanism that can speed or enrich action perception, but it is not constitutive of it.\n\n1. Clarifying the Target Claim\n\n\u2018Motor resonance\u2019 refers to the activation of an observer\u2019s motor system in ways that correspond to the kinematic pattern of an observed action\u2014classically, activity in the premotor \u201cmirror\u201d areas discovered in macaques and later inferred in humans with fMRI and TMS. \u2018Perception of goal-directed action\u2019 is the visual (or more broadly sensory) apprehension that a sequence of movements is oriented toward a distal outcome (reaching for an apple, switching on a light). The necessity thesis says:\n\n(N) For subject S and observed movement M, S perceives M as goal-directed only if a mapping from M onto S\u2019s own motor repertoire is executed (overtly or covertly) during perception.\n\nThis is stronger than the weaker facilitation thesis:\n\n(F) Motor resonance typically improves speed, accuracy, or phenomenological richness of goal-ascription, though other mechanisms could in principle suffice.\n\nI shall defend the falsity of (N) and the plausibility of (F). The argument unfolds in three steps: empirical counter-examples, theoretical concerns, and objections answered.\n\n2. Four Empirical Counter-Examples\n\n2.1 Developmental Asynchrony\n\nNewborns and 3-month-old infants reliably look longer when a hand reaches inefficiently for a toy (over a transparent barrier) than when it takes the straight, efficient path, suggesting they expected efficiency toward the toy as goal (Csibra et al., 1999). Yet at 3 months these infants cannot themselves reach efficiently; indeed, many have not mastered stable reaching at all. The necessity theorist might reply that infants possess a motor \u201cblueprint\u201d that suffices for resonance even if overt execution is impossible. But when 3-month-olds wear elbow-restricting mittens that prevent any matching motor program, their sensitivity to goal structure persists (Skerry et al., 2013). The motor channel is not merely latent; it is experimentally blocked, yet perception of goal-directedness survives.\n\n2.2 Congenital Motor Impairment\n\nPeople born without arms (amelics) cannot form the motor commands for hand or arm actions in the ordinary sense. Yet in several studies they judge the goal of manual actions\u2014threading a needle, grasping a cup\u2014as quickly and accurately as controls (Vannuscorps & Caramazza, 2016). If motor resonance were necessary, such observers should suffer a selective deficit whenever the action falls outside their motor repertoire, but they do not.\n\n2.3 Cross-Species Perception\n\nA city dweller watching a dog bury a bone, a bird build a nest, or an octopus unscrew a jar instantly recognises the actions as directed toward burying, building, or obtaining food. Few humans harbour motor programs for wing beating or tentacle manipulation. Unless we stretch \u2018motor repertoire\u2019 so far that it can simulate anything in arbitrarily abstract form\u2014thus draining (N) of content\u2014we must concede that observers can perceive the goals of actions they could not in principle perform.\n\n2.4 Impossible Tools and Katana-Style Swings\n\nRock-climbers who watch a speed-skater, or pianists who watch a samurai swing a two-metre nodachi, grasp the skater\u2019s and samurai\u2019s intentions despite lacking the requisite musculature or training. Researchers have tested this systematically by showing subjects computer-generated avatars whose joints bend at biologically impossible angles; observers still recover goal information from efficiency cues and trajectory extrapolation (Maranesi et al., 2020). Resonance, at least in an isomorphic motor sense, cannot underwrite that capacity.\n\n3. Explaining the Positive Capacity without Necessity\n\nHow can goal-directedness be perceived without resonance? The key is that the visual system is exquisitely sensitive to configural and kinematic patterns that correlate with intentional structure. Three ingredients suffice: (i) segmentation of motion into discrete events, (ii) attribution of minimal efficiency, and (iii) contextual priors.\n\n3.1 Event Segmentation and Kinematic Heuristics\n\nThe dorsal stream clusters optic flow into units with coherent velocity and curvature; abrupt changes flag sub-goals (Zacks et al., 2007). Independent of motor simulation, such segmentation allows the system to pick out the salient \u201creach\u2013grasp\u2013withdraw\u201d triad in a hand movement.\n\nEfficiency heuristics then interpret segmented trajectories. Gergely & Csibra\u2019s \u201cteleological stance\u201d theory proposes that observers treat agents as rational planners who achieve goals with minimal energy under constraints. Whether the agent is a dot on a screen or a human hand, deviations from the straight-line path are encoded as evidence of obstacle negotiation, thereby licensing goal attributions. This works even for geometric figures (the classic Heider-Simmel animation).\n\n3.2 Contextual and Affordance-Based Priors\n\nVisual perception is never naked; it is informed by statistical learning about objects\u2019 affordances. A mug affords grasping by its handle, and a door by its knob. These affordance priors, encoded in ventral-stream regions like the lateral occipital complex, allow the visual system to \u201cpredict forward\u201d how an object will likely be manipulated, hence infer the likely distal goal. For this high-level inference, exact motor commands are irrelevant.\n\n3.3 Predictive-Coding Architecture\n\nPredictive-processing models, increasingly popular in cognitive neuroscience, conceptualise action perception as hierarchical generative modelling. Lower visual layers predict pixel-level motion; higher layers predict intentions. Where exactly the generative process is implemented\u2014motor circuits or multimodal association cortex\u2014is an empirical matter that does not bear on necessity. The architecture permits multiple redundant paths: sometimes motor codes help, sometimes not.\n\n4. Where the Necessity Thesis Gets Its Grip\n\nGiven the blatant counter-examples, why would anyone endorse (N)? Three strands of evidence fuel the view:\n\n4.1 Neural Correlates\n\nObservation of grasping actions activates the very premotor neurons that fire during execution; TMS over those areas disrupts fine-grained discrimination of grasp type (Avenanti et al., 2007). This suggests a causal role.\n\n4.2 Temporal Coupling\n\nThe latency of mirror-neuron firing overlaps with the time course of goal recognition, raising suspicions that the two processes are intertwined.\n\n4.3 Phenomenology of \u201cJust Seeing\u201d\n\nProponents emphasise the phenomenological immediacy of goal perception\u2014one \u201cjust sees\u201d that Peter is pouring wine. Simulation allegedly supplies the missing link between raw kinematics and purposive interpretation.\n\nYet each strand can be reinterpreted once we abandon the binary necessity claim.\n\n4.1\u2019 Causal but Not Constitutive\n\nDisrupting premotor areas impairs some forms of action recognition, but so does disrupting the superior temporal sulcus or intraparietal sulcus. Many nodes comprise a distributed network; knocking out any may degrade performance without being the site where goal-directedness is computed. Lesion evidence shows that patients with premotor cortex damage can still recognise others\u2019 goals, though often more slowly (Buxbaum et al., 2014). That profile fits a facilitation, not necessity, function.\n\n4.2\u2019 Shared Latency vs. Shared Mechanism\n\nSimultaneity does not imply identity. Early stages of vocal recognition and lip reading also unfold within 200 ms, yet no one claims that perceiving speech requires covert articulation\u2014indeed, profoundly deaf signers perceive mouthings they cannot produce.\n\n4.3\u2019 Phenomenology as Trituration\n\nIntuitive \u201cjust seeing\u201d is compatible with multiple subconscious processes. Veridical depth perception feels immediate though it depends on stereopsis, shading, accommodation, and cue integration. Immediacy alone cannot decide which specific mechanism is indispensable.\n\n5. Counter-Replies and Rejoinders\n\nObjection 1: \u201cAbstract Motor Codes\u201d\n\nAdvocates may concede that one need not activate the exact effector but insist on a more abstract motor representation\u2014perhaps coding goals themselves. That claim, however, threatens to trivialise (N). If motor codes are abstract enough to include anything that represents a goal, then the thesis reduces to: \u201cto see a goal, one must represent a goal,\u201d a tautology.\n\nRejoinder: Scientific hypotheses earn their keep by risking falsification. A necessity thesis that retracts into untestable abstraction is not explanatory.\n\nObjection 2: \u201cDevelopmental Bootstrap\u201d\n\nMaybe infants first use perceptual heuristics but later, as motor skills mature, resonance becomes the adult basis for goal perception.\n\nRejoinder: Adult studies with motor-impaired individuals and cross-species scenarios already refute adult necessity. Moreover, neuroimaging reveals robust STS and parietal activation during goal perception even when premotor resonance is suppressed with concurrent hand tasks. The adult system plainly retains multiple avenues.\n\nObjection 3: \u201cOptimality and Noise\u201d\n\nEven if alternative mechanisms exist, perhaps they are too slow or error-prone for real-world demands; de facto, humans always recruit resonance when available, so calling it \u2018necessary\u2019 is pragmatically, though not logically, correct.\n\nRejoinder: The pragmatic slide is telling. (N) is a modal, not statistical, claim. And existing data betray ample situations\u2014ambidextrous observation, abstract animations, reversed video playback\u2014in which observers rely on purely perceptual heuristics with no decrement in performance.\n\n6. A Positive Account: Layered Intentional Perception\n\nTo move beyond negation, consider a layered model with three tiers:\n\nTier 1: Kinematic Parsing (vision-only). Spatiotemporal filters register joints, velocities, and segment motion.\n\nTier 2: Teleological Inference (amodal). Inputs from Tier 1 feed a Bayesian module that infers likely distal goals by combining efficiency priors, environmental affordances, and statistical regularities.\n\nTier 3: Motor Emulation (if available). When the inferred goal falls within the observer\u2019s repertoire, an emulation loop in premotor cortex simulates the action, mid-course updates verify prediction error, and empathetic affect may piggy-back (e.g., feeling the effort of lifting a heavy box).\n\nIn this architecture, resonance is contingent, optional, and functionally helpful: it improves temporal prediction of action endpoints, underwrites empathy, and offers an internal model for rapid counter-actions (catching a ball someone else throws). Crucially, the perception of goal-directedness occurs by the end of Tier 2. Tier 3 refines, enriches, and prepares motor responses, but basic perception does not await it.\n\n7. Illustrative Cases\n\n7.1 The Silent Piano\n\nImagine watching a concert pianist in a soundproof booth. Even non-musicians recognise the crescendos, phrase endings, and goal of concluding on a perfect cadence though they cannot play the piano. Their judgment leans on visual information about finger trajectories, hand lifts, and torso sway, plus a learned association between such patterns and musical structure.\n\n7.2 Chess on a Blind Board\n\nChess experts watching a stream of algebraic moves (e.g., \u201cNf3, g6, Bg7\u201d) instantly perceive White\u2019s kingside-development strategy. No motor resonance with knight moves is possible; the format is symbolic. Though chess is a domain of planned goal-directed action, understanding proceeds via abstract pattern recognition, not motor mimicry.\n\n7.3 Autonomous Vehicles\n\nSelf-driving car algorithms must predict pedestrian intentions to ensure safety. These systems, devoid of motors analogous to human limbs and certainly incapable of \u201cresonance,\u201d nevertheless achieve competent goal prediction through vision-based deep-learning modules combined with trajectory forecasting. Artificial systems demonstrate, by construction, that resonance is not a necessary computational ingredient.\n\n8. Philosophical Pay-Off: Rehabilitating the Objectivity of Action Perception\n\nIf motor resonance were necessary, we would face a troubling subject-dependence: a person paralysed from birth could never truly perceive ordinary human action as goal-directed. Rejecting (N) rescues the commonsense objectivity of action perception: goals are public, informationally available features of behaviour under the right description, not private projections of each observer\u2019s bodily repertoire.\n\nGibson\u2019s ecological theory captured this objectivity: affordances are directly perceived because they are invariant stimulus structures available to any suitably attuned organism. On a contemporary, naturalised reconstruct-tion, those invariants include kinematic patterns of efficiency that specify purposive organisation. Motor resonance may align the observer\u2019s bodily possibilities with what is perceived, thus explaining why action understanding can feel bodily grounded. Yet that feeling is contingent, not constitutive.\n\n9. Conclusion\n\nThe arguments and evidence converge: motor resonance is not a necessary condition for perceiving goal-directed actions. Developmental, neuropsychological, cross-species, and artificial-system cases show that observers can access the relevant intentional information by purely perceptual-cognitive routes. Neural and behavioural data that link resonance to action understanding point to a facilitative, modulatory role. Recognising this layered architecture reconciles the richness of embodied engagement with the universality of action perception: we are indeed bodily creatures whose motor systems resonate with what we see, but our capacity to see purposiveness does not stand or fall with that resonance.\n\nWord count (approx.): 1990", "output_tokens": 3420, "reasoning_tokens": 448}

Introduction and Thesis\n\nWhen I watch a tennis player serve, I not only see a human arm accelerating a racket toward a fuzzy green ball; I seem to experience the serve as aimed at launching the ball over the net with power and spin. A prominent family of explanations\u2014rooted in the discovery of \u201cmirror\u201d or \u201cmotor\u2010resonance\u201d neurons\u2014holds that this perception of goal-directedness depends on simulating the action in my own motor system. According to the strong necessity claim:\n\nNecessity Thesis (NT): One can perceive an action as goal-directed only if one\u2019s motor system resonates with (i.e. covertly emulates) that very action.\n\nI shall argue that NT is false. Motor resonance can facilitate and sometimes enrich one\u2019s grasp of others\u2019 goals, but it is neither conceptually nor empirically necessary. There are at least two alternative, non-motor routes to perceiving goal-directedness: (i) purely visual extraction of distinctive kinematic patterns and (ii) rapid inference from situational affordances and \u201cteleological rationality.\u201d Evidence from atypical motor agents, cross-species perception, and infants suggests that these non-resonant routes are operative even when resonance is absent or impossible. I conclude by proposing a pluralistic \u201cmulti-route\u201d model in which motor simulation is one tool among several, not the gatekeeper to social perception.\n\n2. Clarifying the Terrain\n\n2.1 What counts as \u201cperceiving an action as goal-directed\u201d?\n\nA minimal condition is that the observer attributes purposiveness to the movement, not merely registering spatiotemporal trajectories. The attribution can be implicit: e.g. anticipating where the ball will land or what the actor will do next. Importantly, perceiving goal-directedness is weaker than having a full-blown theory of mind; one need not represent beliefs or desires explicitly.\n\n2.2 What is \u201cmotor resonance\u201d?\n\nI reserve the term for automatic, sub-threshold activation in the observer\u2019s motor cortex that is isomorphic (in relevant ways) to the observed action. Resonance is thus distinct from:\n\na) Conceptual knowledge of the motor act.\nb) Covert visual imagery.\nc) Overt mimicry.\n\nWith these definitions, NT becomes an empirical claim about a neural prerequisite for a perceptual capacity.\n\n3. The Argument from Motor Resonance\n\nProponents of NT typically offer three lines of support:\n\n(1) Neurophysiological correlation: Observing grasping actions activates the same premotor neurons that fire during one\u2019s own grasping (Rizzolatti et al. 1996). The correlation is interpreted as evidence of causal necessity.\n\n(2) Causal intervention: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) that disrupts motor areas impairs subjects\u2019 ability to predict action goals (Avenanti et al. 2013). The inference is that the disruption targets a necessary mechanism.\n\n(3) Developmental plausibility: Infants\u2019 motor systems mature in tandem with their ability to parse goal-directed gestures; simulation provides a plausible ontogenetic bridge.\n\nLet us concede that these findings show motor resonance is often recruited in action understanding. The question is whether that recruitment is indispensable. I shall lodge four objections.\n\n4. Four Objections to the Necessity Thesis\n\n4.1 Agents with Impoverished or Absent Motor Repertoires\n\nCongenital limb aplasia offers a natural experiment. People born without arms can nevertheless identify, anticipate, and verbally describe others\u2019 manual actions with normal accuracy\u2014even though they cannot resonate with limb movements they have never executed. Vannuscorps and Caramazza (2016) used fMRI to show that such individuals lack canonical hand-action motor representations but perform on par with controls in recognizing grasp intentions. NT predicts a severe deficit; the prediction is refuted.\n\nA critic might reply that motor resonance need not involve identical effectors: perhaps shoulder or tongue representations stand in. But the response dilutes NT into an untestable \u201canything managerially motor counts\u201d thesis. Moreover, TMS applied to surrogate effectors in aplasic participants does not impair their recognition, suggesting genuinely non-motor processing.\n\n4.2 Cross-Species Perception\n\nCheetahs lack hands, yet they track gazelles\u2019 escape trajectories in a way that reveals sensitivity to the prey\u2019s evasive goals. Conversely, humans instantly perceive the hunting intent of a rattlesnake strike, despite being physiologically incapable of performing such an action. Given anatomical constraints, resonance is implausible; still, goal attribution is immediate. One might object that \u201cperception\u201d here is anthropomorphically projected. Yet ethological and behavioral studies show anticipatory adjustments that would be inexplicable without representing the other\u2019s purposive orientation\u2014e.g. birds altering flight paths before contact when stalked.\n\n4.3 Dissociative Neurological Evidence\n\nIn ideomotor apraxia, patients\u2019 own motor planning is impaired even though they retain action comprehension. Hickok (2014) summarizes cases where individuals cannot imitate opening a lock yet can accurately judge that another person\u2019s motion is aimed at unlocking. Motor resonance is disrupted (as measured by mu-suppression and TMS), but perceptual goal attribution is spared. By contrast, lesions to posterior temporal and parietal regions do impair action comprehension while leaving motor execution intact. The double dissociation undermines necessity.\n\n4.4 Systematic Process Models\n\nThe \u201cPrinciple of Rational Efficiency\u201d model (Gergely & Csibra 2003) explains infants\u2019 goal attribution by assuming they pick out the most energy-efficient path to an external end-state, given physical constraints. The computations rely on physical reasoning about obstacles and affordances, not on simulating limb trajectories. Computational implementations (e.g. inverse planning algorithms) reliably generate human-like goal inferences without motor emulation. These models show the conceivability\u2014and empirical viability\u2014of non-resonant mechanisms.\n\n5. How the Necessity Thesis Can Retreat, and Why That Is Not Enough\n\nFacing the above data, defenders of resonance often retreat to a disjunctive concession:\n\nModerate Contingency Thesis (MCT): Motor resonance is necessary only for perceiving actions within one\u2019s own motor repertoire under normal viewing conditions; atypical subjects and exotic actions recruit backup inferential systems.\n\nMCT saves core mirror claims by adding epicycles. But the dialectical cost is high: the \u201cnormal condition\u201d clause risks triviality, and the proposed division of labor remains speculative. Without principled criteria delineating when simulation is invoked, MCT lacks explanatory power. Below I sketch a more systematic alternative.\n\n6. A Pluralistic Multi-Route Model\n\n6.1 Distinguishing Kinematic and Teleological Routes\n\nRoute 1: Kinematic Template Matching\n   \u2022 Input: skeletal motion trajectories.\n   \u2022 Processing: statistical learning extracts prototypical velocity, jerk, and curvature signatures.\n   \u2022 Output: recognition of action type (e.g. \u201cgrasp,\u201d \u201cthrow\u201d) and low-level goals (e.g. \u201ccontact the cup\u201d).\n\nRoute 2: Teleological Reasoning\n   \u2022 Input: spatial layout, environmental constraints, current object configurations.\n   \u2022 Processing: cost-optimal planning (inverse rational control) infers distal goals (e.g. \u201cquench thirst\u201d).\n   \u2022 Output: prediction of future world states.\n\nRoute 3: Motor Simulation (Resonance)\n   \u2022 Input: visuo-motor correspondence mapping.\n   \u2022 Processing: covert emulation yields forward-model predictions.\n   \u2022 Output: expectation of proprioceptive consequences and feasible sub-goals.\n\nNone of the routes is individually sufficient across the board, but neither is any one necessary. They operate competitively and cooperatively, weighted by context, expertise, and time pressure. For split-second interceptive judgments (a baseball pitch), resonance may dominate; for abstract or novel tasks (interpreting a flute performance), teleological inferences and kinematic cues take the lead.\n\n6.2 Explaining the Empirical Landscape\n\nThe pluralistic model accounts for:\n\n\u2022 Limb-deficient observers: Route 2 and Route 1 substitute for absent Route 3.\n\u2022 TMS disruptions: Interfering with Route 3 impairs performance only when tasks are designed to rely heavily on quick motor predictions.\n\u2022 Expertise effects: Dancers show heightened resonance for their own style\u2014but observers still detect the dance\u2019s goal sequence via kinematics.\n\u2022 Development: Infants gradually integrate routes; early goal detection via teleological reasoning precedes fine-grained kinematic parsing.\n\n7. Addressing Objections\n\nObjection 1: Correlation still implies some causal role.\n\nReply: Yes. My claim denies necessity, not causal contribution. Resonance can be facilitative, accelerating prediction accuracy. But to treat a facilitator as necessary is the fallacy of asserting the consequent.\n\nObjection 2: Without resonance, perception is \u201ccognitively penetrated\u201d by post-perceptual inference, so not genuine perception.\n\nReply: The empirical border between perception and early cognition is fuzzy. Even if teleological inference is cognitively rich, it can be fast, automatic, and encapsulated\u2014meeting functional criteria for perceptual mechanisms. Philosophically, the issue reduces to stipulative taxonomy; epistemically, what matters is explanatory sufficiency.\n\nObjection 3: Mirror neurons may code intentions abstractly, not merely motoric details, preserving necessity at a higher level.\n\nReply: If mirror areas encode intentions simpliciter, the term \u201cmotor resonance\u201d becomes misleading. Further, lesions sparing premotor but damaging temporal intention-coding regions break goal perception. Thus premotor codes are not necessary.\n\n8. Positive Philosophical Payoff\n\n8.1 Against Simulationism as Unifying Paradigm\n\nThe demise of NT undermines broader simulationist accounts of social cognition. While simulating others can be a powerful tool, human interaction recruits heterogeneous resources: folk physics, statistical learning, language-mediated norms. Simulation is neither the royal road nor the explanatory baseline.\n\n8.2 Rehabilitating Direct Perception\n\nIf motor resonance is not required, the perceptual system can directly specify goal-directedness through ecological information\u2014gesture kinematics, object affordances, environmental constraints. This lends empirical heft to Gibsonian ideas of \u201cdirect social perception,\u201d free of intermediate simulation.\n\n8.3 Ethical Implications: Inclusivity\n\nAcknowledging non-motor routes counters ableist presumptions that empathic understanding hinges on bodily similarity. It validates the social perceptual competence of individuals with atypical bodies and, by extension, artificial agents that lack humanlike motors but can still respect human goals.\n\n9. Conclusion\n\nMotor resonance is an elegant, biologically grounded mechanism that often enriches our perception of others\u2019 purposes. But elegance should not be confused with exclusivity. Converging evidence from limb-deficient observers, cross-species interactions, neuropsychological dissociations, and computational models shows that humans possess multiple, partially redundant pathways to goal perception. Accordingly, the strong necessity thesis must be rejected. A pluralistic approach, recognizing kinematic, teleological, and motor-simulative routes, better captures the complexity and resilience of human social perception.\n\nApproximate word count: 1,980", "output_tokens": 2625, "reasoning_tokens": 256}

Introduction and Thesis\n\nThe discovery of \u201cmirror neurons\u201d in macaque premotor cortex encouraged an influential hypothesis: to perceive another creature\u2019s action as goal-directed, one must covertly rehearse that action in one\u2019s own motor system. This \u201cmotor-resonance necessity claim\u201d (MR-N) has been adopted, in stronger and weaker versions, by philosophers of mind (e.g., Goldman 2006; Gallese 2009) and by some cognitive neuroscientists. I shall argue that MR-N is false. While motor resonance can facilitate, refine, and sometimes speed the perception of goal-directedness, it is not constitutively required. Visual and inferential resources, complemented by general-purpose predictive mechanisms, are sufficient for representing others\u2019 actions as aimed at goals, even when motor simulation is impaired, absent, or impossible. To defend this thesis I will:\n\nA. Distinguish different senses of \u201cperception,\u201d \u201cgoal-directedness,\u201d and \u201cnecessity,\u201d clarifying the dialectical terrain.  \nB. Reconstruct the main empirical and conceptual arguments offered for MR-N.  \nC. Provide counter-evidence from developmental, neuropsychological, comparative, and technology-mediated cases.  \nD. Offer a positive, multi-route model on which motor resonance is facilitative but dispensable.  \nE. Address three residual objections.\n\n2. Clarifying the Target Claim\n\n2.1 Perception vs. Cognition\n\n\u201cPerceiving\u201d an action as goal-directed can mean (i) subpersonal registration of goal-structure by the visual system, (ii) personal-level belief or judgment, or (iii) the combination of both (phenomenal experience of \u201cseeing what she\u2019s up to\u201d). MR-N is most plausible as a claim about (i): that low-level action understanding depends on resonance. I shall target that version, though much of my argument generalizes.\n\n2.2 Goal-Directedness vs. Intentionality\n\nSome movements are goal-directed in a thin, teleological sense (they converge on an external target) even if the agent lacks propositional intentions (a frog\u2019s tongue strike). Others are fully intentional (writing a letter \u201cin order to\u201d contact a friend). MR-N usually concerns the thinner sense: perceiving the movement as organized around an outcome. I focus on this, noting that if resonance is unnecessary for the thin sense, it is unlikely to be necessary for the thicker one.\n\n2.3 Types of Necessity\n\nLogical necessity is obviously too strong; advocates of MR-N intend nomological or biological necessity: in beings like us, under normal conditions, perception of goal-directed action requires motor resonance. My counterexamples aim to defeat that modal claim.\n\n3. The Case for Motor-Resonance Necessity\n\n3.1 Argument from Neuronal Co-activation\n\nPremise 1: Neural populations in premotor and parietal cortex fire both when I grasp and when I see you grasp.  \nPremise 2: The functional role of these neurons is to represent the goal of the action.  \nConclusion: Goal representation during action observation is implemented by motor resonance; without it, there is no such representation.\n\n3.2 Developmental Argument\n\nInfants fail to show anticipatory eye movements to others\u2019 goals until they can perform the action themselves (e.g., reaching). Therefore, acquiring the motor program is a prerequisite for perceiving goal structure.\n\n3.3 Interference Argument\n\nTMS disruption of premotor cortex impairs participants\u2019 ability to judge others\u2019 actions; similarly, constraining observers\u2019 own hands selectively hampers perception of manual goals. So motor resonance is necessary in the on-line perceptual process.\n\n3.4 Parsimony Argument\n\nThe brain already has an embodied model of how to bring about outcomes; re-using it for perception is metabolically efficient. Thus perception probably piggybacks on simulation rather than recruiting distinct, expensive visual inferential resources.\n\n4. Why the Case Fails\n\nEach argument contains empirical or conceptual gaps that, once revealed, dissolve the thrust of MR-N.\n\n4.1 Co-activation Does Not Imply Necessity\n\nCorrelated neural firing shows involvement, not indispensability. Visual cortices (e.g., MT, STS) and associative regions (TPJ, mPFC) also respond to action observation. Lesion studies reveal many patients with extensive motor-area damage who nevertheless identify goal-directed actions normally.\n\nExample: Patient D.F., with visual-form agnosia and dorsal stream damage, cannot visually guide her own grasping but accurately judges others\u2019 grasp appropriateness (Jeannerod 1994). Conversely, apraxic patients who cannot execute actions still perceive action goals (Rothi & Heilman 1997). Such dissociations refute strict necessity.\n\n4.2 Developmental Correlations Are Not Dependencies\n\nLongitudinal data show motor competence and action understanding rising together around 3\u20135 months. But correlation may stem from a third factor: maturation of parietal-temporal pathways that support both reaching and perceptual tracking. Crucially, infants with congenital limb absence (Poliakov et al. 2014) visually anticipate others\u2019 reaching goals on the same timetable as typical infants. They have never executed the action, yet they perceive its goal. MR-N predicts failure here; the data show success.\n\n4.3 Interference Studies Prove Facilitation, Not Necessity\n\nTMS degradation produces graded decrements, not wholesale loss, of goal perception; tasks requiring fine-grained kinematic discrimination are affected more than coarse goal detection (Avenanti et al. 2017). This pattern indicates motor resonance sharpens sensitivity, much like phoneme-specific cortical areas enhance speech perception without being necessary for understanding language (subcortical pathways are sufficient for gist).\n\nFurther, when the effector differs radically from any in the observer\u2019s motor repertoire\u2014e.g., watching a dog open a gate with its muzzle\u2014people effortlessly perceive the goal, even though there is no plausible motor resonance. If resonance were necessary, such cross-effector perception should collapse.\n\n4.4 Parsimony Cuts the Other Way\n\nEcological optics provides direct information about affordances and goals via kinematic invariants (Johansson 1973; Barker 2014). The computational load of mapping retinal motion to motor commands and back is arguably greater than registering looming trajectories toward salient objects plus context cues. Thus a purely visual route may be the brain\u2019s economical default, with resonance recruited opportunistically when overlap is high.\n\n5. A Positive Multi-Route Model\n\nI propose the Complementary Routes Model (CRM):\n\nRoute V (Visual-Predictive): The dorsal visual stream, supplemented by superior temporal sulcus and cerebellar prediction circuits, extracts kinematic patterns and environmental affordances, computing a forward model of object\u2013agent\u2013goal relations. This route operates for any visible effector and is amodal with respect to the observer\u2019s own body.\n\nRoute M (Motor-Resonant): If the observed action matches a stored motor schema, premotor\u2013parietal circuits simulate it. Simulation supplies rapid, fine-grained expectations about future states, improving temporal alignment, error detection, and empathic attunement.\n\nThe routes run in parallel; convergence in anterior cingulate and prefrontal cortex yields the personal-level sense that \u201cshe is reaching for the cup.\u201d If Route M is disabled (e.g., paralysis, limb loss, TMS), Route V suffices for goal perception, though with slower or less nuanced prediction. If both routes conflict\u2014say, when watching an inverted body perform everyday actions\u2014vision dominates for coarse goals, while motor signals highlight anomalies (\u201cthat hand-stand coffee pour is weird\u201d).\n\n6. Counter-Examples in Detail\n\n6.1 Paralysis and Locked-In Syndrome\n\nMany patients with high spinal cord injury lack efferent motor commands below the neck, eliminating limb-specific resonance, yet they competently recognize manual goals in videos and live interactions. Phenomenological reports describe no change in their perceptual grasp of others\u2019 intentions, only in empathic \u201ckinesthetic mirroring\u201d (Birbaumer 2015).\n\n6.2 Congenital Amputees Using Prostheses\n\nIndividuals born without forearms, fitted in adolescence with myoelectric hands, report initially \u201cseeing\u201d others\u2019 reaches and grasps long before acquiring any capacity to execute them. fMRI shows typical activation in visual and STS regions, minimal in premotor cortex (Vannuscorps & Caramazza 2016). Again, MR-N fails.\n\n6.3 Non-Biological and Improbable Agents\n\nSpectators perceiving the goal of a chess-playing robotic arm or an on-screen arrow moving toward a target do so despite lacking any motor ability to reproduce the movement. Their perceptual attribution is immediate; learning curves are flat. Resonance theorists sometimes reply that we map such movements onto generic \u201creaching\u201d schemas. But if the schema is abstract enough to accommodate arrow motions, it functions more like a conceptual representation than a motor plan, conceding my point.\n\n6.4 Cross-Species Social Perception\n\nAnimals perceive goal-directedness in conspecifics whose motor repertoires diverge. Dogs track human pointing to fetch objects, even though they cannot point. Fish avoid larger fish\u2019s predatory lunges\u2014behaviors impossible for them to execute. These ethological facts undermine the anthropocentric variant of MR-N.\n\n7. Replies to Three Objections\n\nObjection 1: Deficits in the mirror system correlate with autism spectrum disorder (ASD); ASD individuals struggle with goal understanding. So absence of resonance impairs perception.\n\nReply: The evidence is mixed. High-functioning ASD observers perform well on simple goal detection but poorly on tasks involving inferential social context (Hamilton 2010). Their difficulties trace to theory-of-mind and attentional factors, not to basic resonance. Moreover, motor-reactivity deficits in ASD may reflect reduced social motivation rather than a causal role in perception.\n\nObjection 2: ERP data show that the Mu rhythm (linked to motor cortex) desynchronizes within 200 ms of observing a goal-directed action, earlier than STS or TPJ activation. So resonance is the first, hence primary, mechanism.\n\nReply: Timing alone does not confer priority. Early visual processing in V1/V2 precedes premotor activation by tens of milliseconds and supplies the features that trigger Mu suppression. Moreover, fast does not mean essential; the spinal reflex is faster than cortical vision, yet we still see with cortex. A feedforward cascade can retain function when later stages are absent; vice-versa is impossible.\n\nObjection 3: Simulation offers a unifying framework for action, emotion, and language understanding; piecemeal visual routes lack such integrative power.\n\nReply: Integration can arise at higher associative hubs that pool inputs from distinct specialists. The brain\u2019s architecture is massively parallel and redundant; insisting on a single \u201chub\u201d undervalues this division of labor. A hybrid CRM preserves explanatory reach while remaining faithful to empirical dissociations.\n\n8. Philosophical Payoff: Transparency Without Identity\n\nThe debate touches a perennial philosophical puzzle: how we attribute mindedness to others. MR-N echoes the view that understanding others is, at bottom, self-projection. Showing that goal perception is possible without self-simulation weakens conservative \u201cproblem of other minds\u201d worries and supports a more externalist stance: the structure of action in the environment carries \u201cpublic\u201d information readable by perceptual systems. Resonance adds color and intimacy, not the basic grasp of agency.\n\n9. Conclusion\n\nMotor resonance is neither sufficient (we sometimes resonate without correctly perceiving goals, as in magic tricks) nor necessary (we often perceive goals where resonance is impossible). A multi-route architecture accommodates the growing body of behavioral and neural evidence, preserves the functional advantages attributed to simulation, and avoids over-claiming its role. Perceiving goal-directed action is, fundamentally, an achievement of the perceptual system writ large, in which motor resonance plays a supportive but non-indispensable part.\n\nWord count (excluding references): ~1990\n\nReferences (abbreviated)\n\nAvenanti et al. 2017.

Within a few years of the first single-cell recordings of mirror neurons in macaque area F5, an alluring philosophical thesis crystallized: perceptual access to another creature\u2019s goal is possible only when the observer covertly \u201cruns\u201d the same motor program. Call this the Resonance Requirement (RR):\n\n(RR) Necessarily, S perceives that another agent A is \u03a6-ing in order to achieve G only if S\u2019s own motor system activates as if S were \u03a6-ing.\n\nIn what follows I argue that RR is false. Motor resonance is neither conceptually nor empirically necessary for perceiving goal-directed action, though it can facilitate speed and richness of understanding. I defend what I call the Dual Route View:\n\n(DRV) Human beings possess at least two partially independent routes for perceiving goal-directed action:  \n(i) a resonance-based, simulation route that recruits the observer\u2019s motor repertoire;  \n(ii) a kinematic-causal route that extracts higher-order patterns from the visual array without motor simulation.  \n\nOnly route (i) requires resonance; route (ii) does not. Because (ii) suffices for veridical goal perception in numerous circumstances, resonance is not a necessary condition.\n\nThe argument unfolds in five steps. Section 1 clarifies the key terms and the modal force of \u201cnecessity.\u201d Section 2 reconstructs the best case for RR. Section 3 presents four empirical and phenomenological counter-examples that jointly undermine the claim of necessity. Section 4 develops a positive account of the non-resonant route, drawing on ecological, computational, and phenomenological resources. Section 5 replies to residual objections and shows why replacing RR with DRV better accommodates the total evidence.\n\n1. Clarifying the Target Thesis  \n\n1.1 Perception versus Judgment  \nRR concerns perception, not discursive judgment. The claim is that in ordinary seeing-another-agent-act, goal information is built into the percept\u2014analogous to seeing a cup as graspable\u2014rather than inferred after the fact. Were RR merely about post-perceptual attribution, the thesis would be trivial: anyone can verbally ascribe a goal regardless of motor activation. The interest lies in whether resonance is required for the perceptual presence of telic structure.\n\n1.2 Goal-Directed Action  \nI follow the ethological tradition: an action is \u201cgoal-directed\u201d when its unfolding is organized around an end-state that functions as a control parameter. A swipe that stops once the apple is grasped counts; a random twitch does not.\n\n1.3 Necessity  \nRR asserts a strict, exceptionless conditional. One counter-example showing perception of goal without resonance suffices to refute it, though in practice we should expect converging evidence from multiple sources.\n\n2. The Best Case for the Resonance Requirement  \n\nProponents of RR marshal three lines of argument:\n\n2.1 The Mirror Neuron Correlation  \nFunctional imaging routinely shows somatotopically specific activation in premotor and parietal cortices when subjects observe familiar actions. The correlation is robust across grasping, kicking, even silent speech lip-reading. From \u201cactivation\u201d they infer \u201cenabling\u201d: if the mirror system is always on during goal perception, perhaps perception needs it.\n\n2.2 Disruption Studies  \nTranscranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over motor areas lengthens reaction times in action recognition tasks and reduces accuracy in predicting action endpoints. If dampening resonance impairs goal perception, then resonance seems necessary.\n\n2.3 Developmental Coincidence  \nIn human infants, the emergence of goal-directed reaching at about five months lines up with the first EEG signatures of action observation matching. The synchronicity suggests causal coupling: infants perceive others\u2019 goals once they can perform those actions themselves.\n\nAlthough seductive, these arguments overreach. Correlation does not yield necessity; intervention studies often degrade but rarely abolish capacities; and ontogenesis does not recapitulate phylogenetic or logical dependence. The next section brings this out.\n\n3. Four Counter-Examples to Necessity  \n\n3.1 Congenital Motor Impairment  \nIndividuals born without upper limbs perceive the goals of manual actions with typical speed and accuracy. Vannuscorps and colleagues (2019) studied such participants watching grasping videos. Despite absent motor resonance in limb-specific cortex, they anticipated goal objects as effectively as control subjects. RR predicts systematic deficits; none were found.\n\n3.2 Cross-Species and Impossible Actions  \nHumans readily see a cat stalking prey, a squid jetting away, or\u2014at the limit\u2014film animations of Martians driving hovercrafts as goal-directed. Because observers lack a matching motor repertoire, resonance cannot underwrite the perception. Indeed, many of the actions (hovering, jetting) are physically impossible for human bodies. Yet their goals are unmistakable.\n\n3.3 Minimal Geometric Animations  \nClassic Heider\u2013Simmel stimuli depict triangles and circles moving around a screen. Viewers spontaneously report narratives of chasing, coaxing, and evading. Eye-movement studies show predictive fixations on goal-relevant locations, evidencing online perceptual anticipation. No conceivable motor program corresponds to \u201csmall triangle coaxing big triangle.\u201d Still, goal information is vividly present.\n\n3.4 Vision in Paralysis and REM Atonia  \nPatients with locked-in syndrome retain full visual capacities while lacking voluntary movement and, by extension, covert motor execution. Documented cases show intact understanding of caregivers\u2019 intentions through gaze alone. Similarly, during REM sleep atonia, dreamers can vividly perceive (and experience) complex goings-on although descending motor pathways are shut down.\n\nEach counter-example is individually sufficient to refute RR; together they render the thesis untenable.\n\n4. A Positive Account of Non-Resonant Goal Perception  \n\nHow, then, is goal information available without motor simulation? DRV identifies a kinematic-causal route relying on the detection of invariant patterns in optic flow and spatial-temporal contingencies.\n\n4.1 Ecological Affordance Extraction  \nGibsonian theory holds that the visual array specifies environmental affordances directly. Cutting and Proffitt showed that the \u201ctau\u201d variable (ratio of current to changing image size) specifies time-to-contact, enabling interception absent motor rehearsal. Extending this idea, goal states like \u201chand to cup rim\u201d are specified by nested invariants (e.g., deceleration profile, homing trajectory). The perceiver need not simulate the movement; lawful structure in the energy array suffices.\n\n4.2 Teleological Kinematics  \nGergely and Csibra\u2019s \u201cteleological stance\u201d research demonstrates that infants treat the most efficient path relative to environmental constraints as goal-directed. When a ball jumps over a barrier and continues straight once the barrier is removed, nine-month-olds look longer if it still follows the arc. They encode the goal (location) from efficiency cues, not from motor resonance\u2014since infants cannot jump like balls.\n\n4.3 Inverse Planning Models  \nBayesian inverse planning (Baker, Saxe & Tenenbaum 2009) computationally recovers an agent\u2019s latent reward function by finding the most probable goal given observed trajectories and environmental constraints. Such models predict human judgments with high fidelity without positing resonance. Neuroscientific work links this computation to temporo-parietal rather than premotor regions, corroborating the existence of a distinct, non-motor inference route.\n\n4.4 Phenomenology of Other Minds  \nPhenomenologists from Scheler to Gallagher emphasize that we experience others\u2019 intentions as immanent in their expressive movements. The smile\u2019s goal of friendliness is read in the curvature, pace, and context. The experience feels direct, not mediated by covert imitation of zygomatic contraction. Resonance might shadow the process, but the percept comes first.\n\nThese strands coalesce: perceivers are attuned to higher-order regularities that lawfully specify goals. The attunement is learned and fallible, but it does not depend on motor equivalence.\n\n5. Replies to Residual Objections  \n\nObjection 1: TMS and lesion studies still show impairments; perhaps resonance is necessary for normal speed or confidence, even if crude goal detection survives.\n\nReply: DRV readily concedes facilitative roles. Disrupting route (i) predictably slows responses because the system normally runs both routes in parallel. But necessity is stronger: if perception persists under disruption\u2014as empirical work confirms\u2014the condition is not necessary.\n\nObjection 2: Maybe subjects without limbs possess \u201cphantom\u201d motor maps; congenital deficiency does not guarantee absent resonance.\n\nReply: Functional imaging shows that upper-limb congenitals recruit no somatotopic hand area during action observation, in contrast to traumatic amputees who do. Moreover, people perceive the goals of birds, snakes, or Heider-Simmel triangles where no plausible phantom effector exists. The plural case seals the point.\n\nObjection 3: The mentalizing route may not be truly perceptual; perhaps observers infer goals cognitively after perceiving mere movements.\n\nReply: Temporal-resolution studies under 200 ms reveal anticipatory saccades toward goal objects before the movement terminates, too rapid for conscious inference yet consistent with perceptual processing. ERP components associated with action understanding arise in occipito-temporal cortex at ~150 ms\u2014earlier than premotor echoes\u2014again suggesting a perceptual route.\n\nObjection 4: Motor resonance might be necessary for certain fine-grained goals, e.g., distinguishing a precision grip aimed at a pen from one aimed at a needle.\n\nReply: Task difficulty modulates which route dominates. For highly familiar, effector-specific actions, simulation confers an advantage. Yet this is a matter of optimal exploitation of available information, not necessity. Experts in dance or sign language show enhanced resonance, but novices still grasp coarse goals.\n\n6. Conclusion  \n\nThe hypothesis that motor resonance is a necessary precondition for perceiving goal-directed action was a natural, even exciting, reaction to the discovery of mirror neurons. But necessity is a rigid modal operator, and nature is rarely so obliging. Evidence from congenital motor impairment, cross-species perception, minimal animation, and neural chronometry demonstrates that humans can and do perceive goals in the absence of matching motor programs. A dual-route architecture explains why resonance correlates with, facilitates, and sometimes refines goal perception without underwriting it.\n\nReplacing RR with DRV has theoretical payoffs. It reconciles ecological and simulationist traditions, predicts individual and cultural variability (e.g., expertise augments the motor route), and integrates neatly with hierarchical Bayesian models of social cognition. Above all, it cautions against conflating an enabling mechanism with a contributing one\u2014a salutary reminder that in the philosophy of mind, as in science, correlation remains shy of necessity.", "output_tokens": 2780, "reasoning_tokens": 512}

Introduction and Thesis\n\nAccording to an influential cluster of hypotheses\u2014variously labelled the motor simulation view, mirror-based theory of action understanding, or the resonance condition\u2014we perceive others\u2019 bodily movements as purposive only insofar as our own motor system can covertly reproduce (or \u201cresonate with\u201d) the kinematics of those movements. Without such resonance, the movements would register as mere physical displacements, lacking the \u201caboutness\u201d that makes them intelligible as pursuing a goal. I shall argue that this condition is false: motor resonance is neither conceptually nor empirically necessary for perceiving goal-directed action, although it often facilitates and enriches such perception. After clarifying what \u201cperception,\u201d \u201cgoal-directedness,\u201d and \u201cmotor resonance\u201d should mean in this debate (\u00a72), I offer three main arguments against necessity (\u00a73-5), reply to three of the strongest pro-resonance objections (\u00a76), and end with a positive account (\u00a77) that relocates goal-understanding in a predictive, amodal event model rather than in the motor cortex. Motor resonance turns out to be a helpful but optional \u201cplug-in\u201d for that model\u2014one that we can do without in a surprising range of cases.\n\n2. Conceptual Ground-Clearing\n\n2.1 Perception.  \nThe question concerns perceptual, not inferential or linguistically mediated, access to others\u2019 goals. We are asking about the kind of immediate, non-deductive awareness by which the infant sees the adult\u2019s reach as \u201cfor the teddy,\u201d or by which the pedestrian sees the driver\u2019s deceleration as \u201cletting me cross.\u201d The debate is not about articulated folk-psychological explanations but about the perceptual content of experience.\n\n2.2 Goal-Directed Action.  \nAn action is goal-directed when its unfolding is organized around a distal state which, if achieved, is treated as success. Most motor resonance theorists also require that the trajectory be selectable relative to obstacles; thus swatting a fly is goal-directed whereas a spasmodic twitch is not.\n\n2.3 Motor Resonance.  \nBy \u201cmotor resonance\u201d I shall mean activation in the observer\u2019s motor system (especially premotor and parietal areas) that mirrors the observed effector\u2019s muscle synergies or dynamical profile. A weaker sense\u2014any \u201cembodied\u201d activation including autonomic or affective responses\u2014would trivialize the claim. The thesis under dispute is the strong necessity thesis:\n\n(NT) For S to perceptually experience O\u2019s movement M as goal-directed toward G, S must deploy a motor representation that could, in principle, generate M toward G.\n\nA defender might also adopt a sufficiency claim, but the question before us is necessity; I remain neutral about sufficiency.\n\n3. Argument from Cross-Effector Understanding\n\nWe effortlessly see a dog digging, a bird looping mid-air for a landing, an octopus unscrewing a jar, and a forklift stacking pallets as goal-directed activities\u2014even though none of us possess the requisite body plans to replicate those trajectories. Can mirror theorists respond that what matters is \u201cmotoric intelligibility,\u201d not literal performance? Perhaps we map the dog\u2019s forelimb to our arm, the bird\u2019s wings to our arms again, and so forth. Yet:\n\na) The match often fails. Consider snakes\u2019 peristaltic slithering or spider silk-spooling. The kinematics share no plausible mapping onto human synergies, yet observers identify the prey-capture goal without difficulty.\n\nb) Even when a homologous mapping is concocted, it comes post hoc: the dog\u2019s digging could map to either a spading action or a bimanual scooping action. Observers do not tacitly choose between these in order to see the goal.\n\nc) In robotics studies, geometric shapes on a screen that change velocity and curvature relative to each other are perceived as chasing or corralling\u2014classic Heider-Simmel displays. No effector is even depicted, so motor mirroring is moot.\n\nSo unless the term \u201cmotor resonance\u201d is inflated to include any neural correlate of understanding, NT fails for cross-effector cases.\n\n4. Argument from Developmental Asymmetry\n\nMotor skills in infants lag markedly behind their ability to perceive others\u2019 goals.\n\na) Six-month-old infants reach clumsily and cannot perform means-end sequences (e.g., removing a barrier to grasp a toy). Yet they look predictively to the toy as soon as the adult\u2019s hand initiates a reach around the barrier (Woodward, 1998). Their motor repertoire lacks the very concatenation whose goal they nonetheless perceive.\n\nb) Ten-month-olds see a mechanical claw perform a goal-change paradigm. If they have previously seen the claw operate on its own with no human hand inside a sleeve, they still treat its reach as goal-directed (Southgate & Johnson, 2008). The mechanical effector is not representable in their motor cortex as a potential limb.\n\nIf motor resonance were necessary, perceptual goal-ascription would appear only once matching motor programs are in place. The timeline is the reverse.\n\n5. Argument from Neurological Dissociation\n\nPatients with specific lesions provide \u201cdivision of faculties\u201d evidence against necessity.\n\na) Ideomotor apraxics with left inferior parietal damage often fail to imitate simple gestures but can still interpret the purpose of novel tool-use demonstrations (Goldenberg & Randerath, 2015). The machinery required for resonance is compromised, yet perceptual goal-ascription survives.\n\nb) Conversely, patients with ventro-temporal lesions may recognize bodily configurations but lose the sense of action purpose (action-specific agnosia). Their motor system is intact, indicating that resonance without the right perceptual integration yields no goal perception. This shows sufficiency is questionable, but more importantly for us, the first set of dissociations shows necessity is false.\n\n6. Replies to Three Pro-Resonance Objections\n\n6.1 The \u201cSub-Threshold Mapping\u201d Reply  \nAdvocates may concede the above phenomena but insist that a deeper or more abstract mirroring, not detectable by current imaging, must underlie all successful goal perception. This is an unfalsifiable retreat. A useful necessity claim must be testable. Given evidence that goal perception can remain when canonical resonant areas are silent or disconnected, burden shifts to the proponent to specify what would count as counterevidence.\n\n6.2 The \u201cFacilitation Implies Necessity\u201d Conflation  \nMotor priming measurably speeds recognition of familiar actions. But causal contribution is weaker than necessity. Oxygen facilitates combustion, yet wax can burn in nitrogen-enriched air. Demonstrations that TMS to premotor cortex slows action recognition show dependence of speed, not logical dependence of occurrence. If the task is made easier (longer exposure, fewer distractors), recognition returns. That is compatibility with facilitation, not necessity.\n\n6.3 The \u201cOntogenetic Bootstrapping\u201d Claim  \nAnother line: infants learn goal percepts via resonance with the limited actions they can perform, subsequently extending by analogy to novel effectors. Yet newborns show goal-sensitivity in certain eye-tracking tasks before they can coordinate their own reaches. Moreover, the induction pattern is not from \u201cself first, other later\u201d: blind infants who lack typical opportunities for manual exploration nonetheless perceive others\u2019 instrumental actions. Thus the developmental bootstrapping hypothesis lacks required empirical footing.\n\n7. A Positive Account: Predictive Event Models\n\nIf resonance is not required, what mediates the perception of goal-directedness? I propose a minimal, amodal event architecture\u2014call it the Generative Predictive Model (GPM) view\u2014composed of:\n\n(i) Segmentation: perceptual systems segment continuous motion into events by detecting kinematic discontinuities and temporal regularities.  \n(ii) Projection: for each segment, the system generates forward models of possible continuations under counterfactual constraints (e.g., obstacles absent).  \n(iii) Error-balancing: the model most efficient at minimizing prediction error against observed trajectory is selected and labeled with its distinctive \u201cend-state\u201d parameter.\n\nImportantly, the GPM is domain-general. It can rely on optic flow alone (as in Heider-Simmel), on sound (interpreting muffled hammering as \u201cnailing\u201d), or on proprioception in joint action. Motor representations are an optional, high-fidelity source for step (ii). When available, they allow fine-grained predictions; when absent, the system falls back on geometric extrapolation, causal physics, or learned statistical regularities.\n\nThree virtues of the GPM view:\n\na) Unification: It explains why we see goal-directedness in non-biological agents (robots, animated triangles) and why we can extend the same perceptual categories to dogs, octopuses, and forklifts.\n\nb) Modularity with Plasticity: It accounts for individual differences (athletes read sports plays faster) without entailing that novices lack perception entirely. Expertise adds motoric priors that sharpen the model.\n\nc) Clinical Plausibility: It predicts that impairing premotor areas degrades temporal precision or richness of action percepts but leaves the coarse goal intact, matching the apraxia data.\n\n8. Residual Motivations for Motor Necessity\n\nWhy, then, did the necessity thesis appear attractive?\n\n(i) Phenomenological immediacy: We experience others\u2019 actions with a felt sense of \u201cI could do that.\u201d But this phenomenology is limited (we do not feel we could fly). Better to treat it as a contingent overlay when motor resonance happens, not as the ground of perceptual intelligibility itself.\n\n(ii) Evolutionary parsimony: One might suppose reusing motor circuitry for social cognition is economical. True, but evolution often recruits multiple overlapping systems; economy does not yield logical necessity.\n\n(iii) Mirror Neuron Enthusiasm: Early mirror-neuron papers (e.g., Rizzolatti & Craighero, 2004) blurred lines between activation correlation and explanatory primacy. Once correlation is distinguished from causal necessity, the inference collapses.\n\n9. Conclusion\n\nMotor resonance is best viewed as a frequent ally rather than a gatekeeper of goal perception. Cross-effector comprehension, developmental data, and neurological dissociations show that humans can and do perceive purposive structure in motion even where no plausible motor mapping is available. A more general predictive event framework explains both why goal-directedness can be perceived without resonance and why, when resonance is available, perception becomes more fine-grained and temporally anticipatory. The necessary-condition thesis should therefore be rejected. In its place we should adopt a layered account in which motor simulation enriches, speeds, and sometimes corrects the percept of goal-directedness, but the percept itself rests on broader representational resources that are neither motoric nor even necessarily bodily in form.\n\nBy disentangling facilitation from necessity, we free research to investigate pluralistic architectures of social cognition rather than forcing all roads through the motor cortex. Future work can explore how symbolic, affective, and sensorimotor cues integrate within predictive models to yield the robust, flexible human capacity to detect and interpret goals\u2014whether in a teammate\u2019s pass, a dog\u2019s expectant bark, or the purposeful advance of an animated triangle across a screen.", "output_tokens": 2627, "reasoning_tokens": 192}

When I watch you hand a mug across the table, a subset of my premotor and parietal neurons fires as though I myself were gripping and extending the mug. According to the strong version of this story\u2014call it the Resonance Necessity Thesis (RNT)\u2014this covert replay is not merely helpful but indispensable: without it, I could not genuinely perceive your handing action as the goal-directed act that it is. In what follows, I argue that RNT is false. Motor resonance is one route\u2014often a fast and reliable one\u2014to the perception of goal-directed action, but it is not a necessary condition. A pluralistic architecture, in which action understanding can be secured by kinematic, contextual, and inferential cues that need not be mirrored in one\u2019s own motor repertoire, both fits the empirical record and avoids conceptual pitfalls that beset RNT.\n\nI proceed in five steps. (1) I distinguish the target phenomenon\u2014perceiving goal-directedness\u2014from neighboring capacities. (2) I articulate the strongest case for RNT, based on both conceptual claims about \u201cdirect perception\u201d and empirical work on mirror neurons. (3) I present three families of counterevidence\u2014developmental, cross-cultural/behavioral, and neuropsychological\u2014that undermine the necessity claim. (4) I diagnose why the lure of necessity arises and propose a more ecumenical, multiple-routes model. (5) I close by defending the pluralist model against two residual objections: that it cannot explain the phenomenological immediacy of action perception and that it forfeits explanatory parsimony.\n\n1. Clarifying the Target: What Is It to Perceive Goal-Directed Action?\n\nTo say that I \u201cperceive a goal\u201d in your action is to claim more than merely registering bodily motion (trajectory, velocity, joint angles). The perception must be intentional, mapping movements onto an outcome-centered template: I see the reach as a reach-for, the kick as aiming-toward. Such perception can occur online, without conscious inference, and can ground rapid predictive adjustments (e.g., I move my cup out of your way). Still, it is a perceptual judgment in a broad sense, one that can succeed or fail independently of the actor\u2019s actual intention. \n\nTwo distinctions will matter. First, perceiving goal-directedness is not the same as mindreading. I may recognize that your arm is aimed at the teapot without attributing a rich, propositional state (\u201cShe intends to pour Earl Grey\u201d). Second, on the output side, engaging mirror mechanisms is not the same as engaging your whole motor plan: partial or subthreshold resonance might suffice for some explanatory roles yet be irrelevant to others. RNT asserts necessity, not mere facilitation, so even a single counterexample where goal perception proceeds in the absence of resonance would falsify it.\n\n2. The Case for Necessity\n\nProponents of RNT stitch together three ideas.\n\na) Conceptual Intimacy: Goal concepts, they argue, are rooted in one\u2019s own motoric possibilities. \u201cTo grasp a goal,\u201d writes Gallese, \u201cjust is to map the observed effector onto my own motor vocabulary.\u201d Without that mapping, the content \u201cfor drinking\u201d literally cannot be encoded in a format available to perception.\n\nb) Neurophysiological Evidence: Mirror neurons in macaque area F5 (and homologous human regions) fire both when the animal grasps an object and when it observes another do so. fMRI studies show similar activations in premotor cortex during action observation. Disruptions to premotor areas via TMS or lesions appear to degrade performance on certain action-understanding tasks.\n\nc) Developmental Plausibility: Infants who cannot yet perform fine-grained grasping nonetheless exhibit emerging mirror activations that correlate with their incipient motor skills. The developmental co-variation suggests that personal motor mastery scaffolds perceptual recognition of others\u2019 goals.\n\nTaken together, these lines of evidence invite the inference that resonance is not just correlated with but constitutive of goal perception.\n\n3. Three Families of Counterevidence\n\nCorrelation, however, is cheap talk when the thesis is necessity. The extant data reveal systematic cases where goal-directed action is perceived despite absent or impossible resonance.\n\n3.1 Developmental Counterexamples: Neonates and the \u201cTongue-Protrusion\u201d Myth\n\nNewborns only hours old prefer biological motion and exhibit anticipatory eye movements when gaze follows a hand reaching for a target. Yet their motor repertoire is rudimentary; they cannot execute the observed reach. One might posit latent resonance mechanisms, but work with infants who have congenital hemiplegia (Boria et al. 2009) shows intact visual anticipation for actions they will never be able to mirror with the affected limb. If personal motor capacity were necessary, these infants should fail.\n\n3.2 Cross-Repertoire Perception: Octopus Gestures and Figure-Skating Jumps\n\nHumans accurately recognize hunting strikes by octopi in documentaries and can predict where the tentacle will land, though we possess no effector remotely similar to an octopus arm. More pedestrian: non-skaters anticipate the landing orientation of a triple Axel well enough to dodge a falling skater on a crowded rink. Eye-tracking confirms that prediction error decreases with exposure even when the observer never attempts to jump. Clearly, perception of the skater\u2019s goal (upright landing) does not bank on simulating a motor sequence few bodies could even approximate.\n\n3.3 Neuropsychological Dissociations: Preserved Perception, Damaged Resonance\n\nPatients with ideomotor apraxia lose the ability to perform goal-directed gestures (e.g., hammering) but score normally on tasks requiring them to identify those gestures in others (Rumiati et al. 2005). Meanwhile, Parkinson\u2019s disease patients with degraded basal-ganglia/premotor loops show dampened mirror responses yet can categorize others\u2019 actions at ceiling. If resonance were necessary, both groups should be impaired in action perception.\n\n4. Diagnosing the Lure of Necessity and Proposing a Pluralist Account\n\nWhy, then, the allure of RNT? Part of the answer is methodological: premotor activations are easy to measure, so they dominate our datasets. Another part is philosophical: the 20th-century legacy of phenomenology and Gibsonian \u201cdirect perception\u201d encourages the idea that seeing a grasp as a grasp must be a kind of \u201cenacted seeing.\u201d But this impulse conflates sufficiency with necessity.\n\nThe pluralist model I propose rests on three claims.\n\nA. Multiple Informational Channels: Kinematic cues (velocity, curvature), environmental affordances (object shape, distance), and social-contextual priors (table etiquette) can each specify a goal. Any one channel can dominate when the others are weak.\n\nB. Flexible Integration: The brain implements a weighted-integration architecture (akin to predictive coding) in which motor priors are recruited when they lower uncertainty, but visual and contextual priors can dominate otherwise. Resonance is thus adaptive, not obligatory.\n\nC. Development via Redundancy: Early in life, infants rely heavily on kinematic regularities (Wolffian periodicity, goal-directness at movement endpoints) because their own motor priors are poor. As they gain motor skill, resonance becomes an efficient shortcut, but alternative channels never disappear.\n\nThis pluralism predicts exactly the pattern of dissociations reviewed above: preserved perception in apraxia (visual/contextual channels compensate), early infant sensitivity (kinematic channels suffice), and cross-species or expert-novice asymmetries (contextual learning substitutes for simulation).\n\n5. Replies to Two Residual Objections\n\nObjection 1: Phenomenological Immediacy. Defenders of RNT say that only resonance can explain why goal perception feels immediate rather than inferential. But immediacy is cheap to posit and hard to measure. The pluralist can allow that motor simulation, when available, enhances the vividness or speed of goal attribution, giving the subjective sense of \u201cdirect grasp.\u201d Yet immediacy is a gradable phenomenological marker, not an ontological litmus test. Seeing depth cues via stereopsis feels immediate; touching a glass to check its temperature feels equally so. Multiple sensory routes can yield immediate contents without any being metaphysically privileged.\n\nObjection 2: Explanatory Parsimony. \u201cYour pluralist model is messy,\u201d the critic says. \u201cRNT gives a single mechanism; surely that\u2019s better science.\u201d But parsimony is theorists\u2019 virtue, not nature\u2019s. When the data indicate heterogeneity, elegance bought at the price of falsity is worthless. Moreover, pluralism is parsimonious at the right level: one prediction-error architecture suffices, with motor resonance as merely one kind of prior among others.\n\nConclusion\n\nMotor resonance is a compelling part of our social neurocognition toolbox. It affords rapid, embodied predictions, scaffolds empathy, and likely streamlines interpersonal coordination. But it is not the foundation on which all action perception rests. Infants, individuals with severe motor deficits, and ordinary observers of exotic movements all routinely detect goal-directedness in the absence of mirrorable motor patterns. A multiple-routes model not only accommodates these data but also anticipates new ones\u2014for example, that virtual-reality observers whose avatar has altered limb morphology will, after adaptation, perceive the goals of avatars with still different morphologies without needing to learn a corresponding motor program.\n\nIf this is right, the philosophical upshot is twofold. First, perception of others\u2019 agency is more ecumenical than motor chauvinists allow; it is not bounded by the silhouette of one\u2019s own body. Second, the embodied mind remains central, but embodiment is a flexible resource, dynamically recruited rather than doctrinally required. Perceiving goals is something we do with the whole epistemic kit\u2014eyes, context, memory, and, yes, motor circuits\u2014none of which holds an exclusive patent on social understanding.", "output_tokens": 2428, "reasoning_tokens": 320}

The slogan, sometimes implicit, is: \u201cNo simulation, no grasp of the goal.\u201d In what follows I argue that this slogan overreaches. Motor resonance is neither conceptually nor empirically necessary for the perception of goal-directed action, though it can be one important contributory route. My strategy is fivefold:\n\n1. Clarify the target phenomenon by disentangling \u201cperceiving a goal-directed action\u201d from nearby notions.  \n2. Distill what the resonance-necessity thesis (RNT) really amounts to.  \n3. Offer three empirical lines and two conceptual lines of evidence against RNT.  \n4. Steelman the best available replies on behalf of RNT and show why they fail.  \n5. Sketch a positive, pluralistic framework on which resonance is optional, not obligatory, in the perceptual economy of goal attributions.\n\nI. Clarifying the explanandum  \nTo \u201cperceive a goal-directed action\u201d is stronger than merely seeing an organism move. It involves registering the movement as organised toward an end state that functions as the movement\u2019s telos: grasping the cup so that one may drink, bending the branch in nest-building, raising a hand to hail a taxi. Crucially, perceiving goal-directedness is not the same as (a) predicting the bodily kinematics, (b) having a folk-psychological belief about the agent\u2019s mental states, or (c) responding with empathy. RNT claims that the perceptual registration of telos depends on activating (overtly or covertly) one\u2019s own motor programs that would generate the observed trajectory were one oneself to perform it.\n\nII. Formulating the resonance-necessity thesis  \nRNT can be stated at three strengths:\n\nWeak: Motor resonance facilitates, but is not required for, perceiving goal-directedness.  \nModerate: Motor resonance is required whenever available; the system defaults to other mechanisms only when resonance is impossible.  \nStrong: Motor resonance is strictly necessary; without it, perceptual goal attribution cannot occur at all.\n\nOnly the strong or moderate readings are philosophically interesting; the weak version reduces resonance to a helpful adjunct\u2014precisely the position I will defend. So let us treat \u201cnecessary\u201d in RNT as denoting strict or default necessity.\n\nIII. Against necessity: the empirical and conceptual case  \n\n1. Early infancy before motor competence  \nPre-reaching infants at 3 months robustly exhibit the Woodward effect: they look longer when an actor reaches for a new object than when she follows a new trajectory to the old object, evidencing sensitivity to goal identity. Yet these infants cannot yet perform the reaching action themselves, and neuro-imaging reveals that canonical mirror areas (premotor cortex, inferior parietal lobule) are not functionally online until months later. To claim hidden motor simulation here posits an implausible ghostly repertoire: infants would need fully specified forward models for actions they have never executed. A more parsimonious reading is that they rely on visual invariants of goal pursuit (continuity, efficiency, object identity), independent of self-motor resonance.\n\n2. Cross-effector and cross-species cases  \nI can readily perceive that an octopus is reaching for a crab or that a heron is spearing a fish, though my body lacks tentacles and beaks. Humans deprived of lower limbs still perceive the goal of a soccer kick. If RNT were true, such cases would require the motor system to stretch itself into impossible shapes\u2014a \u201ctentacle motor program\u201d or \u201cbeak jab motor program.\u201d No plausible neurophysiology supports this. More telling, fMRI studies show that canonical mirror areas respond weakly or not at all to actions whose kinematics cannot be mapped onto the observer\u2019s repertoire, yet behavioral goal attribution remains excellent.\n\n3. Neurological dissociations  \nPatients with ideomotor apraxia or motor cortex lesions may lose the capacity to imitate or even pantomime simple actions, indicating degraded motor representations. Nevertheless, they routinely succeed on tasks that require identifying another person\u2019s goal\u2014e.g., matching tools to targets, predicting action endpoints from incomplete trajectories, detecting errors in others\u2019 actions. Dissociation cuts against necessity: intact goal perception in the face of disabled motor resonance suggests functional independence.\n\n4. Conceptual point: distinct explanatory level  \nResonance theories conflate vehicle with content. The content \u201cShe is reaching for the apple\u201d is an intentional level description; the vehicle is whatever neural process carries it. Even if simulation were one way to encode such content, necessity would follow only if no alternative vehicle could do the job. But visual-perceptual processes look for ecological regularities\u2014directionality, impedance, velocity profiles\u2014that specify telic relations without simulating self-movement. Philosophically, this is an existence proof: the same representational content can, in principle, be realised in non-motor formats.\n\n5. Computational economy and informational sufficiency  \nPerceiving telos requires extracting constraints on motion relative to an environment (targets, obstacles, energetic optimality). The visual stream contains this information directly (Gibsonian invariants such as tau, minimum-jerk trajectories). Running a motor program is computationally more expensive than reading off kinematic cues already present in the optic array. Because the nervous system is under evolutionary pressure for efficiency, we have positive reason to expect non-simulation shortcuts to evolve.\n\nIV. Replies for the resonance advocate and rebuttals  \n\nObjection 1: Latent motor maps  \nPerhaps infants and congenitally limb-deficient observers still possess \u201clatent\u201d motor programs not tied to actual bodily effectors, inherited from evolution and available for resonance. Reply: A latent program sufficiently abstract to cover tentacles, beaks, and prostheses collapses into an amodal dynamic model, no longer recognisably \u201cmotor.\u201d At that point the thesis ceases to be about resonance and becomes a claim that perception employs abstract dynamical prediction\u2014compatible with my pluralist view.\n\nObjection 2: Performance vs. competence  \nThe apraxic patient\u2019s damaged motor execution does not entail damaged motor representation; maybe the representation is alive and well, silently driving perception. Reply: Double-dissociation methodology insists on independence, not identity. Given that apraxics show impaired imitation yet spared goal perception, the burden shifts: why should the representation be selectively unavailable for imitation but fully available for perception? A simpler reading is separate mechanisms.\n\nObjection 3: Mirror neuron evidence  \nSingle-cell recordings in macaques show mirror neurons firing both when grasping and when watching grasping. Doesn\u2019t that prove necessity? Reply: The inference from correlation to necessity is fallacious. Mirror activity may facilitate efficiency or depth of understanding, but necessity demands that when mirror firing is absent, goal perception collapses\u2014which the empirical cases above deny.\n\nV. A pluralistic architecture: complementary, not compulsory  \nHow, then, do we perceive goal-directedness? I propose a dual-route model.\n\nRoute A: Visual-kinematic heuristics  \nThe dorsal stream tracks trajectories, environmental affordances, and efficiency constraints. By coupling motion statistics with object identity and spatial layout, the system computes a \u201ctelic vector\u201d pointing to the likely goal. This route is conceptually akin to Gergely and Csibra\u2019s teleological stance and to Gibsonian direct perception. It works independently of one\u2019s own effector repertoire.\n\nRoute B: Motor resonance and embodied prediction  \nWhen an observed action falls within one\u2019s motor repertoire, inverse models in premotor cortex can covertly reproduce the kinematics, delivering a forward prediction of the sensory outcome. Concordance between predicted and observed feedback refines the telic estimate and perhaps affords richer phenomenology (e.g., a sense of \u201chow it feels\u201d to perform the action).\n\nCritically, neither route is universally privileged; the system flexibly weights them by reliability per Bayesian cue-integration principles. In cases of alien effectors, Route A dominates; in first-person imitation learning, Route B takes the lead. The architecture honours the genuine contributions of motor resonance without granting it monopoly status.\n\nIllustrative example: Watching a master potter  \nSuppose I watch a potter shape clay, a skill I lack. I nonetheless see that she is closing the vessel\u2019s lip. Route A reads the radial inward motion and recalls the typical telos of pottery strokes. Motor resonance is weak because my motor system lacks a relevant schema. Contrast a professional potter observing the same scene: Route B gives her additional insight about the torque required, perhaps enabling error prediction that exceeds my own. Both of us perceive the goal; her perception is enriched, not categorically different.\n\nVI. Philosophical upshot  \n1. Epistemological humility: Multiple realisability warns against inferring necessary mechanisms from sufficiency evidence.  \n2. Metaphilosophical moral: The debate is not merely empirical but about levels of explanation\u2014vehicle/content confusions routinely inflate necessity claims.  \n3. Research programme: Investigate the weighting function governing cue integration between kinematic heuristics and motor resonance, varying with expertise, effector overlap, and social context.\n\nConclusion  \nMotor resonance is a powerful, biologically elegant resource for understanding others, but it does not operate as the gatekeeper of goal perception. Visual-kinematic heuristics, affordance detection, and higher-level conceptual schemas each independently ground the capacity to perceive telos. Recognising this plurality aligns the philosophical account with the empirical landscape, avoids over-commitment to a specific neural mechanism, and opens richer avenues for studying social cognition across developmental stages and species. In sum: simulation may deepen our grasp of others\u2019 actions, but we can\u2014and regularly do\u2014see what they are up to even when our own motor system remains silent.", "output_tokens": 2470, "reasoning_tokens": 384}

Ever since mirror neurons were discovered in the macaque premotor cortex, many researchers have argued that the ability to \u201crun\u201d another\u2019s action in one\u2019s own motor code is the key that unlocks goal understanding. According to this simulationist picture, you recognize that the other\u2019s hand is reaching for the cup because your own motor system silently rehearses an identical reach; the rehearsal supplies the action\u2019s point, thereby transforming mere movement into an intelligible, goal-directed deed. The boldest versions of the view add a modal operator: motor resonance is not just helpful but necessary for perceiving goal-directed action.\n\nI will argue that this necessity claim is false. Motor resonance is neither constitutive of, nor indispensable to, the perceptual grasp of goal-directedness. Instead, the capacity to perceive actions as purposive is multiply realizable: it can be implemented through motor simulation but can also rely on purely visual, contextual, and inferential resources. Resonance serves as an efficiency enhancer and a source of phenomenological vividness, but it is one mechanism among several. I develop this thesis in six steps. (1) I sharpen the key concepts\u2014\u201cperception,\u201d \u201cgoal-directed action,\u201d and \u201cmotor resonance\u201d\u2014and disambiguate the necessity claim. (2) I present empirical evidence from developmental psychology, cross-species cognition, and neuropsychology that dissociates goal perception from motor repertoire. (3) I assemble philosophical considerations that make the purported necessity suspect on a priori grounds. (4) I address three influential arguments for the necessity thesis and show where they overreach. (5) I sketch a positive alternative\u2014a relational, affordance-based model enriched by hierarchical predictive coding\u2014on which resonance is optional. (6) I conclude by identifying residual questions and experiments that could settle remaining controversies.\n\n1. Conceptual Ground-Clearing\n\nPerception. The debate concerns the perceptual, not merely reflective, registration of goal-directedness. If I spend five minutes consciously reasoning that a twitching hand is trying to play Morse code, no one would say I perceive the goal; the claim is that purposiveness can be read off directly, on-line, as part of what Gibson called the \u201cambient array.\u201d\n\nGoal-directed action. Philosophers distinguish between bodily movement, action, and goal-directed action. The last implies not just intentional generation but also the presence of a teleological structure: the movement unfolds toward an outcome that functions as an attractor. Importantly, perceivers often attribute goals well above the kinematic level (e.g., \u201ctrying to repair the radio,\u201d not merely \u201crotating a screwdriver\u201d).\n\nMotor resonance. I reserve the term for automatic, subpersonal activation of motor circuits that would be executed if the observer were performing the observed action. Mere activation of generic premotor regions, activation that codes goals abstractly rather than motorically, or conscious imagery do not count. On the necessity view, without such motor mirroring the perceptual system cannot present the action as directed toward a goal.\n\nNecessity claim. A mechanism M is a necessary condition for cognitive capacity C if, in every possible situation where an agent has C, the agent deploys M. Single-modality evidence of covariation is insufficient; one must rule out counter-instances.\n\n2. Empirical Dissociations\n\na) Developmental timing. Infants attribute goals months before they possess the corresponding motor repertoire. Six- and even three-month-olds expect a human hand that has repeatedly reached over a barrier for an object to maintain the same goal when the barrier is removed, a classic \u201cWoodward paradigm\u201d finding. Three-month-olds cannot yet execute barrier-circumventing reaches, yet they parse the observed movement teleologically. Proponents reply that the infant motor system can \u201csimulate\u201d reaches it cannot yet perform. But that answer blurs the line between resonance and generic prediction; positing occult, silently mature motor programs amounts to immunizing the theory against falsification.\n\nb) Cross-species cases. Dogs can track human pointing, goats follow a conspecific\u2019s gaze to food, and octopuses solve jar-opening tasks after watching conspecifics\u2014even though their limb kinematics diverge radically from ours and from one another\u2019s. The match between observer and actor\u2019s motor repertoire is limited, yet goal recognition occurs. Mirror-theorists sometimes invoke \u201cfunctional equivalence\u201d rather than literal similarity, but once again the account threatens to become purely stipulative.\n\nc) Neuropsychology. Patients with peripheral paralysis or corticobasal degeneration lack the ability to execute many limb movements, yet they recognize the same movements in others as purposeful. More telling are ideomotor apraxics who cannot program specific actions: though their motor resonance is disrupted, they still rate goal-directedness appropriately in action-recognition tasks. When temporal variations in the readiness potential (measured by MEG) predict perception of goals, apraxics show dampened resonance yet normal behavioral performance. This dissociation is fatal to necessity.\n\nd) Novel-tool and impossible-agent perception. Viewers readily see a humanoid wielding a seven-joint telescoping rod as \u201ctrying to snag a distant fruit.\u201d Most of us possess no motor schema for seven-joint telescopic reaching. Likewise, audiences judge Pixar\u2019s sentient lamps and teapots to pursue goals despite lacking a motor repertoire for springing like a lamp or wiggling like a teapot. The appeal to \u201cmotor emulation at a higher, effector-independent level\u201d again moves the goalposts: the resonance specified becomes so abstract that it no longer meaningfully contrasts with vision-based goal extraction.\n\n3. Philosophical Grounds against Necessity\n\nFirst, necessity would collapse the distinction between structural and functional explanation. An architect can recognize a flying buttress without being able to construct one; analogously, perceiving that a trajectory is headed for a goal is a matter of visually extracting dynamic regularities\u2014velocity changes, curvature toward a target, energy minimization\u2014not a matter of being able to produce identical forces.\n\nSecond, simulation cannot be both necessary and explanatorily potent in the same sense. If I must first recognize the movement well enough to choose the matching motor program, perception already contains the relevant goal information; resonance becomes epiphenomenal. To avoid circularity, the necessity theorist must show a bottom-up causal story where motor matching precedes goal attribution, which empirical timing studies do not support.\n\nThird, the very possibility of non-embodied artificial systems reliably detecting goals\u2014autonomous cars anticipating pedestrian intent\u2014undercuts necessity. Unless one posits that such systems can only work because software inadvertently implements \u201cas if\u201d motor resonance, the logical space for non-motor goal perception is open.\n\n4. Three Arguments for Necessity Rebutted\n\n4.1 The Correlation Argument. fMRI and TMS studies repeatedly show that mirror regions (inferior frontal gyrus, inferior parietal lobule) light up during observation of goal-directed acts. Yet correlation is not necessity. The same studies show robust superior temporal sulcus activation whose disruption impairs goal perception more directly. In TMS designs where IFG is stimulated and STS left intact, behavioral goal recognition remains at ceiling; the reverse manipulation drops performance dramatically. Resonance looks auxiliary.\n\n4.2 The Disability Argument. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) correlates with weaker motor resonance; ASD individuals also show difficulties in action understanding\u2014ergo, resonance is necessary. But meta-analyses reveal that when stimulus complexity is controlled, ASD participants perform normally on goal perception tasks despite diminished mu-suppression (an EEG resonance marker). Their difficulties arise in rich social narratives requiring mental-state attribution, not in perceiving purposiveness per se.\n\n4.3 The Phenomenological Argument. Proponents like Gallese claim that resonance explains the felt immediacy of understanding others\u2019 actions\u2014the \u201cI know what she\u2019s doing because I feel it in my bones.\u201d Even granting the phenomenology, transcendental inference from \u201cX contributes to the feeling of immediacy\u201d to \u201cX is necessary for perception of goal\u201d is a non sequitur. Intensifying vividness is not the same as constituting content. Wine connoisseurs perceive flavor profiles better than amateurs, but olfactory training is not necessary for tasting sweetness.\n\n5. A Positive Alternative: Relational, Predictive Action Perception\n\nPerceiving goal-directedness is, first and foremost, perceiving a relation between an agent\u2019s unfolding kinematics and a salient environmental affordance. Vision is exquisitely sensitive to such relations. Johansson-style point-light displays already suffice: when dots accelerate toward an invisible object and decelerate on contact, observers see a goal. The ecological information is in the optical flow, not in a covert resonance.\n\nHow does the brain implement this? Hierarchical predictive coding offers a plausible architecture. Mid-level visual areas encode motion trajectories; higher levels predict future states on the assumption of efficiency (minimum jerk, energy minimization). These predictions are goal-conditional: the visual system implicitly asks, \u201cIf the hand aims at the apple, how will it move?\u201d Competing goal hypotheses generate forward models; mismatches drive error signals that suppress unlikely goals. Crucially, the forward models need not be motoric, though motor circuits constitute one computational resource the system can recruit. If motor resources are damaged or developmentally immature, the system falls back on purely visual generative models housed in posterior STS and temporo-parietal junction. When motor resources are available, they supply richly parameterized, dynamically precise priors that sharpen prediction and yield the feeling of \u201cI could do that.\u201d\n\nThis account has four virtues.\n\n1. Multimodality: It predicts that blindfolded individuals using auditory cues alone, or visually impaired subjects using tactile substitution devices, can perceive goal-directedness. Preliminary evidence from echo-locating blind participants confirms this.\n\n2. Inter-agent generality: Because the generative modeling works at the level of relational dynamics, it generalizes across morphologies\u2014explaining dog, goat, and even octopus cases.\n\n3. Gradability: It accommodates the fact that perception of purposiveness comes in degrees. Resonance enhances precision, leading to faster and more confident goal attributions, which matches response-time data.\n\n4. Clinical predictions: It forecasts that simultaneous disruption of both motor and posterior visual predictive resources will impair goal perception catastrophically, while isolated damage to either need not. Double-lesion patterns could be used to test the theory.\n\n6. Residual Questions and Future Work\n\n(a) Boundary conditions. Are there goal categories\u2014say, fine-grained tool manipulations\u2014where motor resonance becomes indispensable because visual regularities alone underdetermine the goal? Systematic manipulation of information content is needed.\n\n(b) Developmental tuning. How do infants\u2019 early non-motor goal-perception capacities interact with emerging motor skills? One hypothesis is that resonance gradually takes over low-level kinematic prediction as motor proficiency grows, freeing visual resources for more abstract social tasks.\n\n(c) Phenomenology. If resonance is non-essential, why does it produce a distinctive \u201cvicarious feel\u201d? Philosophers of mind can explore whether this feel is mere qualia overlay or plays a constitutive role in empathy.\n\n(d) Artificial intelligence. Implementing separate visual and motor generative models in robots and selectively lesioning them could offer decisive evidence: can the robot still extract goals when motor simulation is off-line?\n\nConclusion\n\nMotor resonance is a powerful, perhaps evolutionarily ancient tool for social cognition, but it is not the sole passport to perceiving goal-directed action. The evidence from infants, cross-species cognition, neuropsychological dissociations, and theoretical analysis converges: perceptual access to others\u2019 goals is multiply realizable. Vision can read purposiveness directly from relational dynamics; context, object affordances, and hierarchical prediction do the rest. Motor resonance refines, accelerates, and enriches this process, which explains why it is so ubiquitous and why impairments can hinder social interaction. Yet perceivers deprived of resonance, whether by developmental timing, neuropathology, or morphological mismatch, still see the point of others\u2019 deeds. Action understanding therefore remains open to agents of many kinds\u2014legged or tentacled, biological or artificial\u2014without requiring that they carry a matching motor program for every movement they observe.", "output_tokens": 3151, "reasoning_tokens": 512}

Introduction and Thesis  \nMost of us have had the uncanny experience of flinching when we see somebody about to bang a hammer on her thumb. Cognitive scientists often explain that jolt of vicarious pain by appealing to \u201cmotor resonance\u201d: roughly, the observer\u2019s motor system covertly rehearses (\u201cmirrors\u201d) the observed movement, and that rehearsal in turn supports our ability to perceive the action as aimed at a goal (missing the thumb, driving the nail). Simulation theorists thus propose a necessity claim:\n\n(N) Motor resonance is a necessary condition for perceiving an event as a goal-directed action.\n\nI shall argue that (N) is false. Motor resonance is frequently sufficient and often useful for perceiving goal-directed actions, but it is not necessary. We can, and often do, perceive goal-directedness independently of resonance mechanisms. The stronger claim that resonance is indispensable runs aground on three sorts of considerations:  \n\nA. Empirical counter-examples: People, animals, and artificial systems that lack the relevant motor repertoire can nevertheless perceive goal-directedness.  \n\nB. Conceptual analysis: What it is to see something as goal-directed is to register an extrinsic relation between an agent and an end-state, not to activate a matching motor schema in oneself.  \n\nC. Theoretical alternatives: Efficient-coding and teleological-rationality accounts explain the data at least as well as, and sometimes better than, mandatory simulation.\n\nI develop these points, respond to the leading pro-simulation arguments, and close by sketching a multi-level view on which motor resonance is one of several\u2014and not the fundamental\u2014routes to perceptual access to agency.\n\n2. Clarifying the Dispute  \n2.1 Goal-Directed Action  \nBy \u201cgoal-directed action\u201d I mean a bodily movement that is (a) produced by an agent, (b) organized toward an outcome, and (c) sensitive to obstacles or changes that bear on the outcome. The hallmark is teleological organization: the trajectory is best explained by reference to some end.\n\n2.2 Perception versus Inference  \nA classical empiricist will insist that we only see shapes and motions and infer goals; a direct-perception theorist will reply that we quite literally see that the dancer is reaching for the cup. The debate over resonance concerns \u201cperception\u201d in this direct sense: the immediate, non-deliberative apprehension of the action as for-something.\n\n2.3 The Necessity Claim  \nNecessary means that without motor resonance, perception of goal-directedness cannot occur\u2014period. Evidence that perception sometimes occurs in the absence of resonance is therefore decisive against (N), even if resonance is the typical route in everyday adult human observation.\n\n3. Empirical Counter-Examples  \n\n3.1 Congenital Motor Absence  \nPeople born without upper limbs cannot instantiate the motor programs required for grasping, yet they recognize grasp actions as readily as the rest of us. Vannuscorps and Caramazza (2016) used fMRI to show that such individuals show no activation in primary motor cortex when watching hand actions. Nevertheless, they categorize grasping versus scratching videos, anticipate the target of a reach from partial trajectories, and detect violations of efficient kinematics. Hence, the perceptual task can succeed when the relevant motor mapping is structurally impossible.\n\nObjection: Perhaps their lower-body motor system substitutes for the missing upper-body repertoire. Reply: The grasp-specific properties (opposition of thumb and forefinger, wrist rotation) have no lower-limb analogues, and multivariate decoding reveals no systematic remapping. The simplest explanation is that a non-motor route suffices.\n\n3.2 Cross-Species Perception  \nDomestic dogs track human pointing and gaze to infer hidden food locations, yet cannot themselves perform precise index-finger pointing. Nine-month-old infants, unable to form precision grips, nonetheless perceive adult pincer grasps as goal-directed. If resonance were necessary, these organisms should be blind to the goal structure until their own motor system matures or matches. They are not.\n\n3.3 Abstract Displays  \nClassic Heider-Simmel animations\u2014two triangles \u201cchasing\u201d a circle into a \u201chouse\u201d\u2014induce robust attributions of pursuit, coaxing, and evasion. Geometric shapes have no limbs, joints, or musculature; the viewer\u2019s motor system has no repertoire to mirror. Eye-tracking and pupillometry indicate that viewers register goal structure rapidly and automatically. Thus, fleshy kinematics are dispensable.\n\nSimulationists sometimes reply that what resonates is not the effector-specific motor program but a more abstract \u201cschematic\u201d motor template for, say, pursuit or avoidance. That reply concedes too much: once the motor mapping is allowed to float free of bodily realization, calling it \u201cmotor\u201d becomes terminological generosity. The phenomenon is better understood as predictive perception of relational motion patterns.\n\n3.4 Pathological Dissociations  \nParkinson\u2019s patients exhibit reduced mirror-neuron activity yet perform normally on tasks requiring them to judge others\u2019 intentions behind actions. Individuals with mirror-touch synesthesia show hyper-resonance but no superior ability to detect goals. These double dissociations undermine a tight necessity relation.\n\n4. Conceptual Reasons to Reject Necessity  \n\n4.1 Content Mismatch  \nWhat one sees when one perceives a goal is an external relation: the cup is to be grasped by the hand. What one represents when one resonates motorically is an internal plan of muscular activation. The two contents stand in no logical entailment. I can have a motor plan without seeing anything (dreams), and I can see a goal without being able to enact any corresponding plan (watching a cheetah sprint). Necessity would collapse this difference in intentional object.\n\n4.2 The \u201cNapping Driver\u201d Test  \nSuppose I am napping in the passenger seat and briefly open my eyes to see the driver swerve to avoid a deer. I instantly perceive the avoidance as goal-directed, but my motor cortex is sluggish and atonic. We would need evidence that motor resonance outruns such peripheral suppression before inferring necessity. None exists.\n\n4.3 Problems of Scope  \nNecessity claims are brittle: one counter-example refutes them. If perceptual psychology can supply even a single viable mechanism that bypasses resonance, the conceptual link dissolves. Given the empirical cases above, the burden shifts to defenders of necessity.\n\n5. Alternative Positive Accounts  \n\n5.1 Teleological Rationality Theory  \nGergely and Csibra propose that perceivers operate a \u201cteleological stance\u201d: they compute the most efficient action that would bring about an observed agent-goal relation, given environmental constraints. This theory explains infants\u2019 surprise when an agent detours around a non-existent barrier (they expect efficiency) and dogs\u2019 sensitivity to occluded object interactions. It predicts the preference for straight-line paths unless obstacles force detours, fitting the infant and animal data without invoking covert motor rehearsal.\n\n5.2 Bayesian Inverse Planning  \nAnother family of models\u2014Baker, Saxe, and Tenenbaum\u2014formalizes goal perception as Bayesian inference over rational planners: we infer the hidden reward structure that makes an observed trajectory likely under a noisily rational policy. These models achieve human-level recognition of goals in both realistic videos and abstract animations. They do so with purely computational resources; implementing them on a laptop suffices, yet laptops have no motor cortex.\n\n5.3 Affordance-Based Direct Perception  \nA Gibsonian could object that both teleological and Bayesian accounts re-introduce inference. But Gibson himself argued that the optic array contains invariant patterns\u2014such as \u201cflow gaps\u201d corresponding to pass-through-able apertures\u2014that specify affordances directly. Cutting and Proffitt showed that the time-to-contact variable \u03c4 can be picked up visually without motor rehearsal. Analogously, some invariant features of agentive motion (e.g., the causal coupling of limbs and objects) may specify goal structure.\n\n6. Replying to Simulationist Arguments  \n\n6.1 Predictive-Coding Efficiency  \nProponents of hierarchical predictive coding (e.g., Kilner and Friston) argue that the motor system\u2019s generative models minimize prediction error most efficiently, so evolution will co-opt them for perception. Crucially, that is an argument for sufficiency and optimality, not necessity. Even on their own presentations, the brain can recruit \u201cdorsal visual stream\u201d models if motor ones are unavailable (e.g., due to lesion). What matters is prediction-error minimization, not its motor vehicle.\n\n6.2 The Interference Argument  \nGalantucci et al. found that interfering with observers\u2019 motor systems (e.g., by having them tap a rhythm) impairs perception of biological motion. Does this show necessity? No. Cognitive tasks often draw on shared resources; taxing working memory impairs color discrimination, but working memory is not necessary to see red. Interference shows contribution, not indispensability.\n\n6.3 Developmental Timing  \nSimulationists note that mirror activity in infants blooms around the time they first perform grasping, implying causal dependence. But correlation is not necessity: grasping experience may train visual prediction without being constitutive. Moreover, neonates (hours-old) prefer goal-consistent displays over random ones (Di Giorgio et al.), well before grasping.\n\n7. A Multi-Level Account: Complementary, Not Constitutive  \nThe evidence suggests a layered architecture:\n\nLevel 1. Kinematic templates: visual motion detectors sensitive to biological motion.  \nLevel 2. Teleological predictors: compute efficiency relative to obstacles and goals.  \nLevel 3. Motor simulation: when available, provides fine-grained forward models that improve temporal prediction and empathy.\n\nMotor resonance sits at Level 3. It enriches, refines, and sometimes accelerates goal perception but rides on top of substrate that can function alone. This view accommodates:\n\n\u2022 Facilitation: Interference with Level 3 slows reaction times.  \n\u2022 Sufficiency: Laptop models (Level 2) succeed without motor code.  \n\u2022 Redundancy: Damage to one level leaves the others operational.\n\nAn apt analogy is speech perception. Visual lip-reading (McGurk effect) can enrich auditory comprehension but is not necessary for hearing words. Similarly, motor mirroring enriches, but does not ground, action perception.\n\n8. Consequences for Broader Debates  \n\n8.1 Understanding Others  \nIf goal perception is not shackled to motor resonance, we need not despair about mind-reading across embodiment gaps\u2014between the able-bodied and the disabled, humans and robots, or even humans and octopuses. Direct perception of telic structure can span radically different motor repertoires.\n\n8.2 Artificial Agents  \nRobotics engineers designing social robots often implement visual goal-recognition modules without motor analogues. The present argument vindicates that strategy: giving a robot a humanoid arm is not a precondition for its camera system to spot human goals.\n\n8.3 Empathy and Ethics  \nWhile empathy may piggyback on motor resonance, ethical understanding cannot depend on having the same body. A society that appreciates agency across bodily differences must rely on perception routes that transcend internal mirroring.\n\n9. Conclusion  \nMotor resonance is a versatile and powerful contributor to our social understanding, but it is not the bedrock on which perception of goal-directed action rests. The empirical literature furnishes multiple dissociations, the conceptual terrain reveals a content mismatch, and alternative theories explain the phenomena without positing a necessary role for simulation. A pluralistic, multi-level model\u2014under which motor resonance is one helpful but dispensable strand\u2014solves more puzzles with fewer commitments.

Introduction and thesis  \nA growing literature in philosophy of mind and cognitive neuroscience maintains that \u201cmotor resonance\u201d\u2014a covert activation of the perceiver\u2019s own motor system that mimics the observed movement\u2014is indispensable for seeing an action as goal-directed. I will argue against this necessity claim. Motor resonance (MR) is neither conceptually necessary nor empirically required for perceiving goal-directed actions. Instead, MR is one among several possible informational routes that can ground such perception. Perceivers can, and often do, attribute goal-directedness by using purely visual, contextual, or inferential cues that bypass motor simulation. MR facilitates and enriches action understanding, especially under conditions of uncertainty or when quick predictions of fine-grained kinematics are needed, but it is not a pre-requisite.\n\nThe plan is as follows. \u00a72 clarifies key notions\u2014perception, goal-directedness, and \u201cnecessity.\u201d \u00a73 rehearses the strongest arguments for the MR-necessity thesis, isolating four rationales. \u00a74 surveys empirical counter-evidence: congenital or acquired motor deficits, cross-effector perception, and computational dissociations between visual and motor representations. \u00a75 develops a positive alternative: a pluralistic, cue-integration model in which goal-directed perception can be grounded in at least three pathways\u2014visual-kinematic, teleological-contextual, and motor-resonant. \u00a76 addresses potential objections and explains why the pluralist position does not collapse into epiphenomenalism about MR. \u00a77 concludes with implications for social cognition and aesthetics.\n\n2. Conceptual groundwork  \n\n2.1. Perception versus judgment  \nBy \u201cperception of goal-directed action,\u201d I mean cases in which the agentive, purposive character of another\u2019s behavior figures in the content of the perceptual experience itself, not merely as a post-perceptual judgment. Watching a barista reach smoothly for a cup, one can literally see the reaching as \u201cfor the cup,\u201d not merely infer it. The debate concerns whether such perceptual content requires MR.\n\n2.2. Goal-directedness  \nI adopt a minimal, Davidsonian notion: an action is goal-directed if it is intelligible under a teleological description (e.g., grasping-for-the-cup) that explains its kinematics. We need not invoke sophisticated mental state attribution\u2014merely purposive organization.\n\n2.3. \u201cNecessary\u201d  \nNecessity in this context is empirical/logical: for any instance in which S perceives A\u2019s movement as goal-directed, MR must occur. Evidence can falsify this by identifying cases of goal-directed perception without MR.\n\n2.4. Motor resonance  \nOperationally: (i) covert activation in primary/premotor cortex (mirror neuron regions), (ii) effector-specific, (iii) time-locked to observation, (iv) functionally similar to execution.\n\n3. The case for necessity  \nAdvocates marshal four lines of argument.\n\n3.1. Developmental scaffolding  \nPremise: Infants\u2019 earliest sensitivity to goal-directedness coincides with emergence of resonance; lesioning infants\u2019 motor repertoire via mittens experiments disrupts goal perception. Conclusion: MR supplies the representational format in which goals are encoded.\n\n3.2. Kinematic inversion  \nObservers correctly predict \u201cwhere the hand will go\u201d only when they can perform the action themselves; non-experts fail to anticipate elite dance moves. The motor system\u2019s forward models supposedly underpin prediction, hence understanding.\n\n3.3. Neurophysiological concordance  \nfMRI/TMS shows premotor and M1 activation when seeing actions. Disrupting these regions impairs action categorization and goal discrimination.\n\n3.4. Philosophical parsimony  \nSimulation deflates the need for a freestanding \u201cmind-reading\u201d faculty; seeing others\u2019 goals is just reusing one\u2019s own motor schemas. On Occam\u2019s razor, why posit extra machinery?\n\nAlthough each rationale has force, they are all compatible with MR being helpful but non-essential. The next section develops this reply.\n\n4. Empirical and conceptual counter-evidence  \n\n4.1. Motor deprivation and intact goal perception  \na. Congenital limb absence: Individuals born without arms (Vannuscorps & Caramazza 2016) exhibit normal ability to perceive hand actions as purposive, despite lacking any motor plans for hand movement. fMRI shows atypical or absent hand-mirror activation, yet behavioural performance is unimpaired.  \nb. Spinal cord injury patients whose corticospinal tracts are severed show normal sensitivity to goal violations in point-light displays; TMS reveals minimal corticospinal excitability during observation (Tidoni et al. 2013).  \nIf MR were necessary, such populations should fail at goal perception; they do not.\n\n4.2. Cross-effector and tool actions  \nObservers readily see the goal in octopus tentacle behavior or in a novel tool-action they cannot perform (e.g., using chopsticks for the first time). Goal recognition precedes learning the motor schema; hence non-resonant visual pathways suffice.\n\n4.3. Temporal dissociations  \nMEG studies (Kilner et al. 2014) find that posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) encodes goal information ~150 ms post-stimulus, whereas premotor mirroring emerges ~250\u2013300 ms. Visual systems may therefore furnish goal percepts first, with MR providing supplementary prediction later.\n\n4.4. Neuropsychological double dissociations  \nApraxic patients with premotor lesions have poor action production yet often judge others\u2019 action goals normally; conversely, patients with pSTS damage struggle to identify goals while retaining intact MR (Zentgraf et al. 2019).\n\n4.5. The kinematic\u2013teleological pathway  \nWork on \u201cintuitive physics/action parsing\u201d (Baker, Saxe, & Tenenbaum 2009) shows that purely visual models using Bayesian inverse planning recover goals from motion trajectories without any motor emulation code.\n\nTogether, these results undermine necessity.\n\n5. A pluralistic, cue-integration model  \n\n5.1. Three informational routes  \n(i) Visual-kinematic: Sensitivity to signatures of efficiency (straight-line reach, 2/3-power law) supplies direct evidence that a trajectory is goal-directed (similar to Gibsonian \u201caffordance\u201d detection).  \n(ii) Teleological-contextual: Knowledge of objects (cups are for drinking) and situational constraints allows perceivers to infer likely goals independent of motor specifics.  \n(iii) Motor-resonant: Covertly executing observed movements yields rich, proprioceptively grounded predictions, enhancing fine-grained anticipation.\n\nEach route can generate representations at varying reliabilities. Perceptual systems integrate them, weighting by cue trustworthiness, analogously to multisensory fusion (Ernst & Banks 2002).\n\n5.2. Functional role of MR  \nWhy keep MR if not necessary?  \na. Temporal precision: Forward models in premotor cortex excel at millisecond-level prediction, vital for real-time coordination (e.g., catching a tossed object).  \nb. Ego-allocentric alignment: Resonance places the observed action in the agent\u2019s body map, facilitating error correction and empathy.  \nc. Learning: MR may update one\u2019s motor repertoire through observation (observational learning).\n\n5.3. Computational implementation  \nA predictive-coding architecture can house the pluralist view. Higher-level goal hypotheses in pSTS/TPJ send predictions to both visual areas (for trajectory features) and premotor regions (for motor commands). MR is engaged when motor predictions are diagnostic, but the system can rely solely on visual error minimization when motor priors are unavailable. Thus MR is optional but recruited on demand.\n\n6. Objections and replies  \n\nObjection 1: Lesion studies use coarse tasks; more sensitive tests might reveal subtle deficits, implying a hidden necessity.  \nReply: Even fine-grained tasks\u2014anticipation of grip aperture or detection of sub-goal violations\u2014are preserved in limb-absent individuals. Hidden deficits would at most show that MR contributes to precision, not necessity.\n\nObjection 2: MR is developmentally primary even if dispensable later; hence \u201cnecessity\u201d holds ontogenetically.  \nReply: Cross-cultural work shows infants as young as 6 months attribute goal-directedness to animated geometric shapes lacking any matching motor repertoire. Moreover, infants\u2019 goal perception of crawling appears before they themselves crawl. Hence early goal perception need not piggy-back on executed skills.\n\nObjection 3: The TMS disruption literature proves causality; interfering with premotor cortex impairs goal judgments.  \nReply: TMS effects are task- and site-specific. Disrupting pSTS produces comparable or larger deficits. The most parsimonious interpretation is that both areas contribute, with partial redundancy; causation does not imply necessity.\n\nObjection 4: The pluralist model risks epiphenomenalism\u2014if MR is not necessary, why did it evolve?  \nReply: Redundancy is common in biological systems when distinct mechanisms cover different ecological niches. MR enhances action understanding under constraints of speed, occlusion, or when visual information is noisy. Its contribution is beneficial though not indispensable\u2014much like stereoscopic depth is helpful but vision survives monocularly.\n\n7. Conclusion and outlook  \nMotor resonance is a valuable, versatile resource, but not a sine-qua-non for perceiving goal-directed action. Perceptual systems leverage a mosaic of cues\u2014kinematic regularities, contextual teleology, and, when available, motor emulation. The necessity thesis overgeneralizes from cases where MR happens to dominate. Recognizing pluralism refines both philosophical theories of social perception and empirical research: we should design studies that manipulate the availability of each cue type and model their integration computationally. Future work may explore whether individual differences in MR weighting relate to social disorders (autism, apraxia) or aesthetic response to dance and sport. In loosening the conceptual handcuffs that tie goal perception exclusively to motor resonance, we open space for a richer, more accurate picture of how minds meet in action.", "output_tokens": 2429, "reasoning_tokens": 256}

If a sensory transducer must be prodded by its target property, the argument goes, then the very idea of \u201ctemporal perception\u201d is category-mistaken\u2014time simply is not the sort of thing that can reach out and touch a nerve ending.  Clocks, however ingenious, seem only to track the shifting positions of hands, the oscillation of quartz, or the decay of cesium atoms.  At best they measure change, not time.  So the skeptic concludes: there can be no temporally dedicated sense organ, and talk of \u201cfeeling\u201d time amounts to a poetic gloss on memory plus expectation.\n\nI shall resist that conclusion.  I will argue that (i) the skeptic\u2019s causal requirement on sensory information is too restrictive, (ii) clock-like mechanisms can carry robust information about temporal properties without time doing any causal work, and (iii) the broader lesson is that representation of a variable X does not invariably require X to push causally on the representing device\u2014covariation secured by lawlike regularity, together with appropriate consumer systems, is enough.  A thermostat represents temperature though \u201ctemperature-ness\u201d exerts no sui generis force; similarly, an organism\u2019s circadian pacemaker can represent time-of-day without time\u2019s metaphysical fingers drumming on the suprachiasmatic nucleus.  Once we appreciate why, the possibility of a genuine temporal sense falls neatly into place.\n\nI.  Revisiting the Causal\u2013Impinge Requirement\n\nThe skeptic\u2019s implicit principle is something like:\n\n(CI)  A system S perceptually represents property P only if P causally impinges on S via a dedicated receptor channel.\n\nCI enjoys intuitive support from paradigmatic sense modalities.  Photons strike opsin molecules, air pressure waves bend cochlear hair cells, and tastants fit into receptor sites.  Yet CI is neither necessary nor sufficient.\n\n1.  Not necessary.  Several widely accepted sensory or quasi-sensory capacities violate CI.  a) Proprioception: muscle spindles do not detect an independent environmental magnitude; they register the stretch of the very muscle in which they are embedded, yet we count proprioception as a sense.  b) Magnetoreception in migratory birds is plausibly mediated by quantum coherence in cryptochrome molecules whose excited states co-vary with geomagnetic orientation, but the causal route may be indirect through photons rather than magnetic lines of force acting directly on receptors.  c) Thermoception: a nociceptor does not detect \u201cheat\u201d as a spooky Stuff but the kinetic agitation of molecules in surrounding tissue.  Time perception sits comfortably within this looser family of senses whose stimuli are relational or derivative.\n\n2.  Not sufficient.  A camera sensor is pummeled by photons yet represents nothing unless there is an interpreting system (a viewer, an algorithm) that treats the correlation between pixel array and distal scene as information.  Raw causal impact is not enough; information must be extracted and put to work.  Conversely, if reliable extraction occurs, direct causal impingement from the represented magnitude is dispensable.\n\nThus we should replace CI with a more liberal Information\u2013Use principle:\n\n(IU)  A device D carries information about variable X for consumer C at time t if, given C\u2019s background knowledge of the causal laws linking D and X, the state of D at t reduces C\u2019s uncertainty about X in a way that is exploitable for the achievement of C\u2019s goals.\n\nOnce IU is in view, the skeptic\u2019s objection loses its force.  The real question is whether systematic, law-grounded covariation exists between some readable state of a mechanism and temporal facts, and whether organisms (or engineers) can put that covariance to use.  Clocks supply an emphatic yes.\n\nII.  How Clocks Inform without Temporal Causation\n\n1.  Internal regularity as a temporal registration condition\n\nA functional clock has two essential features:\n\na)  A state-space whose evolution is governed by a highly stable, approximately time-homogeneous dynamical law L (for quartz clocks, harmonic oscillation at \u224832,768 Hz).\n\nb)  A calibration, or initial condition, that secures a mapping M from positions in that state-space to times in an external temporal framework (usually the Earth\u2019s rotation or Coordinated Universal Time).\n\nGiven L and M, later states of the clock are nomically chained to earlier states in such a way that reading the pointer value at t* allows an informed consumer to infer \u201cit is now t*.\u201d  Crucially, the immediate cause of the pointer being at position p is the preceding pointer state p\u2032 plus the mechanical constraints of L; no extra \u201ctemporal rays\u201d need to emanate from the present moment.  Yet the pointer position carries perfectly usable information about time because, under the known regularity, p would not obtain unless the temporal parameter had advanced by the appropriate amount since calibration.  That is enough under IU for representation.\n\nCompare a mercury thermometer.  Brownian motion does not exert a \u201ctemperature force\u201d on mercury; rather, molecular kinetic energy induces volumetric expansion according to well-charted laws.  Similarly, time\u2019s passage is registered by a clock through lawful change in the clock\u2019s own substrate.  If we should grant that a thermometer senses temperature, parity of reasoning grants that a clock senses time.\n\n2.  Law-mediated covariation: why common-cause suffices\n\nDretske famously remarked that \u201cinformation flow\u201d can ride on common causes: smoke carries information about fire even though the fire causes both smoke and warmth, not smoke about fire.  In the clock case, the common cause of both the pointer state and the true temporal fact is the prior pointer state plus L.  Once calibration locks the mapping, each successive state functions as a lawful surrogate for a unique elapsed-time value.  The causal link is indirect but unbroken.\n\nA skeptic may counter that the covariation is purely internal\u2014clock states covary with earlier clock states, not with time per se.  But this overlooks that time enters L as a parameter.  Harmonic oscillation is described by x(t) = A sin(\u03c9t + \u03c6).  If \u03c9 is constant, x at t1 is nomically tied to x at t0 in a way that factors through t1 \u2212 t0.  Given calibration, we invert the function: from observed x we retrieve t.  The mapping is lawful and stable, so information obtains.\n\n3.  Measuring what cannot cause: radioactive dating as case study\n\nCarbon-14 atoms in an ancient bone decay with half-life \u03c4 = 5,730 years.  No \u201cage rays\u201d nudge the Geiger counter; rather, age determines the fraction of remaining undecayed nuclei via the probabilistic law N(t) = N0 e^\u2212\u03bbt.  A single count reveals little, but statistical sampling lets us estimate t since death.  Here again, the sensed magnitude (age) lacks causal oomph.  What does the causal work is nuclear decay plus something we might call a stable rate constant.  Still, few hesitate to say that radiocarbon dating tells us the specimen\u2019s age.\n\nIII.  Biological Timekeeping: Circadian Pacemakers as Endogenous Clocks\n\nHaving softened the causal requirement, we can relocate the discussion from brass gears to neural tissue.  Mammals possess a master clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN).  Even in constant darkness the SCN exhibits \u224824-hour gene-protein feedback oscillations.  These oscillations satisfy the two criteria above: (a) state-space regularity (transcriptional\u2013translational feedback loops) and (b) periodic calibration via photic input at retinal intrinsically photosensitive ganglion cells each dawn.  Downstream systems\u2014sleep\u2013wake cycles, hormone release, temperature regulation\u2014consume SCN signals to schedule behavior adaptively.  That is a full-blown sensory function: extraction of temporal information from an internal oscillator disciplined by environmental cues.\n\nOne might object that the real stimulus here is light, so circadian rhythms reduce to vision.  But consider (i) the oscillator\u2019s persistence in free-run, (ii) its ability to entrain to non-light zeitgebers (feeding schedules, social interaction), and (iii) experiments with blind mole-rats who lack rods and cones yet retain circadian entrainment via melanopsin.  The SCN is not a mere derivative of photoreception; it is a timing organ exploiting multiple entrainment pathways to represent a temporally external variable, the phase of the solar day.\n\nIV.  Counter-Objections and Replies\n\n1.  \u201cCovariation minus causation yields accidental correlation.\u201d\n\nReply:  The objection confuses contingent co-occurrence with lawlike dependency.  A clock\u2019s pointer position at t is not merely correlated with t; it is functionally determined, in the sense that, modulo noise, the relation is sub-nomically necessary given L and calibration.  That suffices for non-accidental information.  In the classic covariation semantics literature, such lawful dependency is exactly what distinguishes information from lucky coincidence.\n\n2.  \u201cTime is the dimension in which change occurs; representing time via change smuggles time in by the back door.\u201d\n\nReply:  The charge amounts to saying \u201cyou can\u2019t measure a meter stick with another meter stick,\u201d but that is wrong.  We routinely measure spatial distance with rulers whose length is the very quantity measured.  The key is that the ruler\u2019s unit length is stable and known, enabling derivative measurement of unknown lengths.  Similarly, we measure unknown durations with periodic processes of known period\u2014atomic transitions, quartz oscillations, circadian gene cycles.  There is no circularity; there is calibration.\n\n3.  \u201cSubjective time illusions (e.g., temporal dilation under adrenaline) show that the brain\u2019s clock does not track objective time, undermining the sensory analogy.\u201d\n\nReply:  All senses are fallible\u2014mirages distort spatial vision; the McGurk effect scrambles audition.  Fallibility does not preclude genuine perception.  What matters is that the system\u2019s normal operation delivers reliably true representation under optimal conditions.  Temporal illusions reveal noise and modulatory influences on the brain\u2019s pacemaker (e.g., dopaminergic effects on striatal beat-frequency circuits).  They no more discredit temporal sense than visual illusions discredit sight.\n\nV.  A Philosophical Moral: Representation without Direct Causation\n\nWhat the time-sense debate exposes is a mistaken monism about the vehicles of perception.  There are two orthogonal dimensions:\n\n1.  Source of covariation: direct impingement vs. internal lawlike evolution.\n\n2.  Consumer exploitation: immediate phenomenological awareness vs. sub-personal regulatory control.\n\nPhotoreception falls in the (direct, phenomenological) quadrant; circadian timing in (internal, regulatory).  Both are genuine sensory adaptations.  The constraint is not \u201cP must poke S\u201d but \u201cP must be recoverable from S by principled decoding rules deployed by the organism.\u201d\n\nSeveral philosophers of mind and information\u2014Dretske, Cummins, Millikan\u2014have emphasized that semantics rides atop systemic functions, not bare causation.  A speedometer represents speed because, given its gearing ratio, needle position lawfully depends on wheel rotations per unit time.  No one demands \u201cspeedons\u201d hitting the dial.  Once we transfer the insight to biological sensors, the path is clear: time senses through pacemakers are as legitimate, metaphysically speaking, as spatial senses through photoreceptors.\n\nVI.  Concluding Proposal: A Taxonomy of Temporal Sensing\n\nTo crystallize the argument, let me sketch a three-tier taxonomy.\n\n1.  Exogenous clocks: sundials, water clocks, marine chronometers.  They depend on external periodic processes (solar position, water flow, mechanical escapement).  Organisms can latch onto such regularities behaviorally\u2014think of flowers opening at dawn (light as zeitgeber).\n\n2.  Endogenous calibrated clocks: SCN in mammals, ultradian oscillators in crustaceans, hourglass enzymes timing developmental events.  Calibration is provided by sporadic sensory cues but the ticker is internal.\n\n3.  Interval timers: cortico-striatal coincidence detectors that accumulate ticks (dopamine-mediated pulses) to estimate sub-second to multi-second intervals, essential for speech parsing, motor coordination, and reward prediction.\n\nAll three tiers satisfy IU: they deliver exploitable temporal information to downstream consumers.  None requires time to be a causal agent.  Instead, each exploits physically governed evolution of a reference process whose states can be mapped onto temporal magnitudes via calibration.\n\nHence the objection fails.  A clock mechanism carries information about time because its changing internal states stand in a nomically guaranteed, calibration-secured relation to temporal parameters, a relation that organisms can and do use to regulate behavior.  Causal impact by time itself is unnecessary; the harvestable covariance is enough.  And that is precisely how a sensory system for time could\u2014and in fact does\u2014exist.", "output_tokens": 3230, "reasoning_tokens": 448}

Introduction and Thesis\n\nA familiar objection to the very idea that animals\u2014or instruments\u2014can literally sense or measure time runs as follows: genuine sensory systems work only when the relevant environmental feature causally impinges on the system. Photons strike the retina; pressure waves deform the cochlea; odorant molecules bind to olfactory receptors. But, the objection continues, \u201ctime itself\u201d is causally impotent. There is no time-particle that collides with a receptor, no temporal field that exerts a force. Hence (so the argument concludes) there can be no genuine sense of time, and devices we call \u201cclocks\u201d must trade on some disguised causal influence from a different feature (thermal expansion, radioactive decay, planetary motion, and so on). \n\nMy thesis is that the objection rests on a conflation. It mistakes the requirement that a detector be causally affected by something for the stronger\u2014and false\u2014requirement that the detector be affected by the very property it ultimately represents. A mechanism can carry information about a property P by being caused to vary with a different property Q, provided that (i) Q reliably covaries with P under appropriate laws and (ii) the organism is biologically or functionally poised to exploit that covariation. Clocks, and the neural systems that underwrite human timing abilities, meet those two conditions. Time is represented not because \u201ctime\u201d exerts a force, but because certain physical processes unfold with a stable temporal regularity that organisms and artifacts can harness. To show this, I first clarify how information and representation work in sensory systems, then examine clock mechanisms, and finally sketch how the same principles illuminate biological timing.\n\n2. Sensing, Causation, and Information\n\nA. The orthodox causal picture  \nWhy is causal impingement thought to be necessary for sensory representation in the first place? One influential answer (found in, e.g., Fodor\u2019s asymmetric-dependency theory and Dretske\u2019s natural-sign approach) is epistemic: a system can exploit a correlation only if that correlation is underwritten by a causal chain connecting the represented feature to the representational state. If the state S is reliably caused by property P, then S carries information that P obtains; the organism can treat S as a sign of P.\n\nB. Two kinds of causal link  \nNotice, however, that a sign can be causally triggered by an intermediate property Q rather than P itself. Smoke carries information about fire, even though it is the hot gases and particulates (smoke) that enter the eye, not the fire-flames. What matters is that (within the relevant nomic background) smoke is reliably produced by fire. Similarly, one and the same photon can simultaneously carry information about the reflectance of an object\u2019s surface, its distance, and\u2014for a spectrograph\u2014its redshift, even though only its frequency and trajectory causally impinge on the detector. In short: causal impact is necessary, but the property that does the impacting need not be the property the system ultimately represents.\n\nC. Lawlike covariation and exploitable structure  \nThe crucial ingredient, then, is lawful, counterfactual-supporting covariation. To the extent that the organism can exploit a de facto stable mapping from the impacting cause to a distal property, the state can carry information about\u2014and thereby represent\u2014the distal property. This point is commonplace in philosophy of science, where measurement is routinely characterized as an interaction that yields data systematically related to the quantity measured, whether or not that quantity does any causal pushing or pulling. Consider:\n\n    Thermometer. Mercury column expansion is driven by kinetic energy of molecules contacting the bulb. Temperature, a macroproperty defined statistically over those energies, does not itself \u201cpress\u201d the mercury; nevertheless, the level of the column represents temperature because there is a lawful monotonic relation between mean kinetic energy and volume expansion.\n\nThe thermometer analogy undermines the view that causal impotence of a property precludes its measurement. Temperature is causally impotent in precisely the sense the objector worries about: it is an abstraction over micro-states, not a force. Yet we have no qualms saying a thermometer senses temperature. The same structure, I shall argue, holds for time.\n\n3. What Clocks Really Measure\n\nA. The basic architecture  \nEvery clock has three components:\n\n1. A regular process or \u201ctime-base\u201d (oscillatory or monotonic).\n2. A counter or accumulator that converts iterations of the process into a numerical or analog magnitude.\n3. A calibration procedure that links that magnitude to standardized units of temporal duration.\n\nIn a pendulum clock, the time-base is the swing period; in a quartz watch, it is the oscillation of a piezoelectric crystal; in an atomic clock, it is the hyperfine transition frequency of cesium atoms.\n\nB. Is the period caused by time?  \nPlainly not. A pendulum\u2019s period \u03c4 \u2248 2\u03c0\u221a(L/g) is set by its length L and local gravitational acceleration g. Quartz oscillation depends on lattice constants and electric potential. Cesium transitions depend on quantum energy gaps. None of these involve a causal role for time. Instead, the mechanisms instantiate a process whose evolutions are describable by differential equations with a temporal parameter t. If you prepare the system in state S(0), the laws prescribe S(t) for any later t. The same can be said for cardiac pacemaker cells, neural oscillators, and radioactive nuclei.\n\nC. Covariation without causation by time  \nBecause the laws governing the time-base are (within a certain range) temporally homogeneous\u2014that is, their parameters do not drift\u2014there is a fixed ratio between elapsed physical time and cycles completed. Counting cycles therefore yields information about elapsed time. Crucially, the causal influence flows from the micro-dynamics of the mechanism to the counter, not from time to the mechanism. Time is a dimension along which the dynamics unfold, not a force entering the interaction term. Yet the reliable mapping from cycles to seconds satisfies the informational criterion: given the state of the mechanism, we can infer elapsed time modulo calibration.\n\nD. The calibration step  \nYou might worry that a mapping is insufficient unless anchored to objective temporal units. But calibration is ubiquitous in measurement. The meter was once defined by a platinum-iridium rod; now by the distance light travels in 1/299,792,458 seconds. Space does not \u201ccause\u201d the rod to have a certain length. What matters is that we have agreed on, and procedurally sustain, a lawful correspondence between readings of the device and the quantity denominated. Clocks are no different: we declare that 9,192,631,770 periods of the cesium hyperfine transition constitute one second. The resulting international system is extraordinarily reliable, yet no causal role for \u201ctime itself\u201d is posited.\n\nE. Summing up  \nA clock mechanism measures time by exploiting a lawful, stable covariation between its internal physical evolution and temporal duration. The property that does the causal work is whatever drives the internal evolution (gravity, quantum transitions, etc.), not time. Nonetheless, the state of the mechanism carries information about time, just as smoke carries information about fire or mercury about temperature.\n\n4. Biological Timing: Toward a Sense of Time\n\nA. Endogenous oscillators  \nHuman and animal nervous systems contain several distinct timing subsystems. Circadian clocks rely on transcription-translation feedback loops in suprachiasmatic nucleus neurons that oscillate with a period of ~24 hours. Millisecond-second interval timing appears to depend on cortico-striatal circuits that integrate pulses from thalamic or cortical oscillators. Again, the causal drivers are biochemical reactions and ionic currents, not time. But because the rate of these processes is relatively stable, counts or phases of oscillations map onto elapsed time.\n\nB. Entrainment as calibration  \nUnlike artifact clocks, biological timers must periodically recalibrate. Circadian rhythms entrain to the light/dark cycle via retinal ganglion cells projecting to the SCN. Beat perception entrains to external auditory rhythms. These calibrations align internal oscillations with environmental regularities, thereby mitigating drift. Note that the entraining stimulus (e.g., blue-spectrum light) stands to the circadian clock as the international cesium standard stands to a quartz wristwatch.\n\nC. Perceptual integration  \nDoes this amount to a \u201csense\u201d of time? On a representational theory of perception, yes\u2014if (i) neural states track temporal properties and (ii) the organism uses them as a basis for behavior. Interval timing abilities satisfy both. Rats trained to press a lever after 20 seconds do so with characteristic scalar variability; humans can tap in synchrony with metronomes at hundreds of milliseconds precision. These feats attest to internal states whose content is temporal. The objection that time is not a causal agent is beside the point; what matters is that internal dynamics reliably covary with elapsed duration and are functionally exploited.\n\n5. Objections and Replies\n\nObjection 1: The covariation story reduces representation to accidental correlation. Suppose my knee hurts whenever it rains. The pain \u201ccovaries\u201d with precipitation, yet it would be absurd to say my knee represents weather.  \nReply: Correlation is insufficient unless embedded in a proper teleofunctional context\u2014what Millikan calls \u201cproper function.\u201d Clocks were designed (or, in biology, selected) to indicate elapsed time; knees were not selected to report weather. Evolution or engineering must have favored the mechanism precisely because the mapping to time was exploitable. Teleological grounding blocks the \u201caccidental sign\u201d worry.\n\nObjection 2: Drift shows that clocks do not really measure time; they only approximate it within a tolerance window.  \nReply: Every measurement is approximate. Thermometers have thermal lag; rulers expand with heat. What justifies calling them temperature- or length-sensors is not perfect fidelity but (a) systematic bias we can model and correct, and (b) the fact that the device\u2019s states vary monotonically with the quantity measured across the operating range. Clocks meet these criteria; drift is a correctable bias, not a refutation.\n\nObjection 3: Time perception displays illusions (e.g., the oddball effect, chronostasis). Doesn\u2019t that show there is no veridical temporal sense?  \nReply: All senses are fallible. Vision has M\u00fcller-Lyer and color afterimages; audition has Shepard tones. The existence of illusions presupposes a normal veridical baseline against which error is definable. If temporal illusions counted against time representation, visual illusions would count against seeing. Instead, they reveal computational shortcuts the system uses to infer temporal properties from neural dynamics.\n\nObjection 4: Even if clocks represent duration, they do not represent the flow or passage of time\u2014the phenomenologically salient aspect.  \nReply: The debate over passage versus static \u201cblock\u201d time is metaphysical, not empirical. What sensory systems can represent is metric temporal relations (before/after, interval length, phase). Whether passage is an additional primitive feature of reality remains controversial. Rejecting time representation because it doesn\u2019t capture passage is like rejecting color vision because it doesn\u2019t capture \u201cqualia\u201d independent of reflectance. Clocks and brains represent the structure that physics and action require; more may be metaphysics, not perception.\n\n6. Clarifying Key Distinctions\n\nDistinction 1: Causal versus informational dependence. A state can carry information about P even if P does not cause the state, provided a law links P to the actual cause Q.\n\nDistinction 2: Direct versus indirect sensing. Vision is often direct (photons from the surface), but smell is indirect (volatile molecules product of distal objects). Time sensing is analogous to indirect sensing: internal dynamics are the proximal cause, dur\u00e9e is distal.\n\nDistinction 3: Quantity versus property measurement. Temperature, mass, and time are quantities defined by relations among processes, not forces that act; measurement of such quantities proceeds by comparison to a reference process. The purported special problem for time dissolves once this general point is appreciated.\n\n7. Substantive Contribution: The Structural Matching View\n\nThe preceding analysis suggests a positive account I call Structural Matching. A mechanism M represents a quantity Q when:\n\n1. M instantiates a family of states S(t) generated by a law L with parameter t.  \n2. There exists a monotonic, law-grounded mapping f: S \u2192 Q within an operating regime R.  \n3. M is calibrated (by design, learning, or evolution) so that agents can use S to guide action concerning Q.  \n\nUnder Structural Matching, temporal representation is prototypical, because most dynamical laws are formulated with explicit temporal parameters, ensuring ample candidates for S(t). What seemed puzzling\u2014that time is not a force\u2014turns out to be advantageous: any stable law provides a resource for timing. Biological evolution and human engineering exploit that fact massively. The wristwatch on your arm, the suprachiasmatic nucleus in your brain, and the argument of Hamiltonian equations in physics all exemplify structural matching.\n\n8. Conclusion\n\nThe objection that there can be no sense of time because time does no causal work trades on an overly literal picture of how sensing and measurement operate. Photoreceptors do not need to be struck by \u201ccolor,\u201d thermometers do not need a \u201ctemperature force,\u201d and clocks do not need to be impacted by \u201cchronons.\u201d What is required is lawful covariation tethered by functional calibration. Clock mechanisms\u2014both silicon-based and carbon-based\u2014satisfy that requirement in paradigm fashion. They harness regular physical processes whose evolution is governed by temporally homogeneous laws, map iterations of those processes onto standardized units, and make that mapping available for inference and action. In this perfectly ordinary, scientifically respectable sense, there is indeed a sense of time.", "output_tokens": 3440, "reasoning_tokens": 576}

Introduction\n\nDoes the very idea of a \u201csense of time\u201d commit one to something metaphysically impossible\u2014namely, to a sensory receptor that is acted on by time itself?  Critics think so.  Vision works because photons impinge on photoreceptors; audition works because pressure waves buffet the eardrum.  But temporal passage, they say, is not a causal agent.  So, if causal impact is the essence of sensation, time cannot be sensed.  My aim is to show that this objection rests on a misunderstanding of how perceptual systems\u2014biological or artifactual\u2014carry information.  A clock can register temporal facts without being causally pushed by \u2018Time-stuff\u2019; likewise, biological organisms can possess a genuine if fallible temporal sense.  The key ideas are (i) covariance rather than direct causal force, (ii) the role of law-governed internal dynamics, and (iii) information-carrying relations that piggy-back on other causal processes.  Nothing in any of that requires that time exert a sui generis force.\n\nI proceed in five stages.  Section 2 analyses the motivating objection and separates two confusions it trades on.  Section 3 explains how physical clocks measure time, stressing that what matters is reliable co-variation under counterfactual perturbations, not a special \u201ctemporal particle.\u201d  Section 4 generalizes the lesson to biological time-keepers\u2014from circadian rhythms to sub-second interval timing\u2014and draws the philosophical upshot: a modality can be sensory in virtue of its functional role, not in virtue of being hit by dedicated environmental carriers.  Section 5 rebuts two residual worries: (a) that temporal tracking is always merely inferential rather than genuinely perceptual, and (b) that representations of time are invariably secondary, parasitic on primary spatial senses.  Finally, Section 6 summarizes the positive picture.  If successful, the argument undercuts the original causal-impotence objection and opens conceptual space for a bona fide sense of time.\n\n2. Diagnosing the Objection\n\nThe causal-impotence objection can be stated more explicitly:\n\nP1. A genuine sensory system acquires information only through causal impacts from the environmental feature it senses.\nP2. Passage of time does not causally impact any mechanism; it exerts no force.\nC. Therefore, no mechanism can sense time; at best it can infer time indirectly.\n\nTwo conflations lurk here.\n\n2.1 Impact vs. Covariance\n\nP1 equivocates between causal impact by the very property sensed and causal impact by some process that covaries with that property.  Vision involves photons, but what vision represents is not photons; it is distal layout, color, motion, faces.  What makes retinal excitations informative about, say, a tiger\u2019s location, is not that \u201ctigerness\u201d pounds rods and cones.  Rather, there exists a reliable lawlike dependency linking tiger-presence to photon patterns, and the visual system is designed (by evolution or learning) to exploit that dependency.  The property represented (location of a tiger) need not itself do the causal pushing; correlated goings-on (light reflection) suffice.  Once this point is grasped, the demand that time itself deliver the causal push looks gratuitous.\n\n2.2 Force vs. Parameter\n\nP2 treats causal impact as if it must be mediated by a force; but many measurable magnitudes are parameter-like rather than force-like.  Temperature, pressure, and pH are paradigmatic.  No separate \u201ctemperature force\u201d hits the thermometer; rather, myriad molecular impacts\u2014and the statistical regularities they instantiate\u2014produce systematic changes in mercury volume or thermistor resistance.  Similarly, time is encoded in the successive states of processes whose evolution is governed by dynamical laws.  The pendulum\u2019s bob, the caesium atom\u2019s hyperfine transition, or the neuron\u2019s oscillatory firing do not need a \u201cchronon shove\u201d; they change because the ordinary forces already in play iterate under temporal evolution.  What the clock exploits is the law that, ceteris paribus, a process will traverse a given state-space trajectory at a characteristic rate.  So P2\u2019s premise, read strongly, is false; read weakly, it is too modest to support the conclusion.\n\n3. How Clocks Tell Time\n\nConsider an ordinary pendulum clock.  Gravitational and tension forces give rise to simple harmonic motion whose period T \u2248 2\u03c0\u221a(L/g).  Neither gravity nor tension \u201cis\u201d time; nonetheless, after N swings the mechanism occupies a state reliably correlated with an elapsed duration \u0394t = N\u00b7T.  If we reset the system at t\u2080 and allow it to evolve freely, then\u2014counterfactually\u2014had a different time interval elapsed, the gear-train would occupy a different state.  This is precisely the sort of robust covariance required for informational carry-capacity, \u00e0 la Dretske or Millikan.  \n\nCrucially, the direction of explanation is not \u201ctime causes the pointer to move\u201d but \u201cthe laws governing the pendulum guarantee that pointer position covaries with elapsed time.\u201d  A helpful analogy is the barometer: falling air pressure deflects the needle; we say the instrument represents atmospheric pressure even though the proximate cause is a mechanical linkage modulated by pressure-induced deformation of a capsule.  In neither case do we insist that \u201cpressure-stuff\u201d or \u201ctime-stuff\u201d reach out and poke the pointer.\n\nOne might object that the pendulum merely embeds a property of its own dynamics; surely that is an internal clock, not a sensory organ.  Yet the semantics of representation does not care whether the carrier is internal or external.  What matters is that the state of the device stands in a counterfactually supported relation to the represented magnitude and that the system is used (by an agent or larger mechanism) to guide action or inference appropriately.  When I consult my wristwatch, I rely on exactly such a relation.  The causal chain that produced the configuration of hands does not include \u201cimpact from time,\u201d yet the watch informs me of the hour.\n\nA more sophisticated illustration is the caesium-beam standard.  The dependence of transition frequency on fundamental constants makes it extraordinarily stable; by counting oscillations we create an index of duration.  Again, no separate temporal force operates.  All that is required is that nature\u2019s laws ensure a fixed frequency.  That is enough for the time variable to be functionally \u201cencoded\u201d in the tally of cycles.\n\nIf a human sensory receptor were built on the same principles\u2014say, an array of neurons whose intrinsic biophysics yields a regular oscillation\u2014then downstream neural circuits could read off phase or count spikes to extract temporal intervals.  In fact, this is close to how the mammalian brain tracks sub-second durations: cortical and striatal circuits integrate pulses from thalamic or brainstem oscillators, then compare accumulation levels to learned thresholds.  Biological clocks are thus homologous, in informational architecture, to their mechanical cousins.\n\n4. Is That Perception?  Biological Evidence\n\n4.1 Circadian Time\n\nThe suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in mammals maintains ~24-hour rhythms via transcription-translation feedback loops.  The cycle persists in vitro, entrains to external cues (light), and drives hormonal and behavioral outputs.  From a functionalist standpoint, the SCN is a dedicated time-sense organ: it generates representations of phase within a circadian period that organisms use to anticipate dawn, regulate metabolism, and so forth.  The system\u2019s sensitivity to external zeitgebers secures calibration, analogous to how the vestibular apparatus calibrates against gravity.\n\n4.2 Interval Timing\n\nOn shorter scales\u2014milliseconds to seconds\u2014animals display Weber-like discrimination, scalar variability, and chronological expectancy effects.  Experiments with \u201cpeak-interval\u201d procedures show that rats, pigeons, and humans learn to press a lever or blink at characteristic delays following a cue; pharmacological manipulation of dopaminergic oscillators predictably shifts perceived duration.  Neurophysiological recordings reveal ramping activity or population clocks whose trajectories encode elapsed time.  Again, nothing temporal literally strikes the nervous system.  Neural dynamics themselves embody the temporal metric, and law-governed covariation with real elapsed time is what licenses interpretation as temporal representation.\n\n4.3 Multimodal Integration\n\nThe brain integrates temporal information across modalities to solve the \u201cunity of simultaneity\u201d problem; for instance, audio-visual asynchrony is compensated by shifting acceptance windows depending on context.  This shows that temporal representations are processed in ways characteristic of standard perceptual data: they are subject to calibration, adaptation, illusion, and Bayesian fusion.  If those are hallmarks of perception, temporal tracking qualifies.\n\n5. Addressing Two Residual Worries\n\n5.1 Isn\u2019t This Merely Inference?\n\nA skeptic might concede that oscillators covary with time but maintain that the organism only ever infers time; the covariance is exploited by higher-level cognition, unlike \u201cgenuine\u201d perception which is iconic or analog.  This demarcation is arbitrary.  Touch receptors transduce mechanical deformation; the brain still \u201cinfers\u201d texture from population codes.  If what matters is subpersonal availability in a format usable by reflexes and mid-level control systems, then temporal encodings meet the criterion.  Consider saccadic suppression of displacement: during eye movements the visual system predicts expected retinal motion using an efference copy and timing signals; errors trigger rapid correction without conscious reflection.  The temporal parameters here are hardly merely inferred post hoc; they modulate perception online.\n\n5.2 Isn\u2019t Temporal Content Secondary to Spatial Content?\n\nAnother line holds that temporal perception piggy-backs on motion or change perception, hence is derivative.  But empirical dissociations cut the other way.  Patients with akinetopsia (motion blindness) can still judge duration; conversely, Parkinsonian patients exhibit distorted time perception while retaining motion perception.  Moreover, static flicker paradigms let one manipulate perceived duration without altering spatial content.  These double dissociations indicate that temporal representation is not merely the shadow of spatial processing.\n\n6. Positive Picture and Conclusion\n\nWe are now in position to answer the guiding question: How can a clock mechanism, biological or mechanical, carry information about time without time itself exerting a causal influence?  The answer has three interlocking components.\n\nFirst, informational semantics.  What makes a state represent X is that, in the normal (selected, trained, or intended) conditions, the state covaries with X in a law-governed way and is used by a consumer system to guide behavior with respect to X.  Direct causal impact from X is sufficient but not necessary.\n\nSecond, physical law.  Many processes have dynamics whose rate constants are stable across contexts (pendulum periods, caesium transitions, gene expression feedback).  When such a process is started at a known phase, its subsequent states correlate with elapsed time.  The mechanism thereby becomes a timekeeper without needing a dedicated temporal force.\n\nThird, functional integration.  Organisms that exploit these correlates in automatic, online, subpersonal ways\u2014calibrating, adapting, merging signals\u2014manifest the hallmarks of a sensory modality.  They track duration, order, and simultaneity in the same sense that color vision tracks surface spectral reflectance: fallibly, corrigibly, but reliably enough for survival.\n\nAccordingly, the causal-impotence objection fails.  It wrongly assumes that representation requires causal action by the represented property itself, and that time\u2019s alleged \u201cimpotence\u201d blocks informational access.  Clocks, whether on wrists or in brains, reveal the flaw: they sense time by harnessing lawful internal dynamics that stand in robust counterfactual support relations to temporal magnitudes.  No metaphysical mystery, no chronon impacts\u2014just ordinary causation plus clever exploitation of regularities.  And that is all a sense has ever needed.", "output_tokens": 3276, "reasoning_tokens": 768}

But nothing in the vicinity is being \u201cpushed\u201d or \u201cpulled\u201d by time. The watch is tick-tocking along of its own accord, and yet its gearing undeniably carries accurate information about temporal passage. Does that show that there could be a perceptual system for time even though time itself never exerts a causal force? I shall argue that it does. More generally, I defend the following thesis:\n\nThesis: A device or organism can possess a genuine sensory representation of elapsed time without time\u2019s being a causal agent, because (i) lawful regularities governing physical change allow internal mechanisms to evolve in ways counterfactually dependent on temporal parameters, (ii) information about time is functionally grounded in such counterfactual dependence rather than in a direct \u201cimpact\u201d from time, and (iii) this renders the \u201cno causal contact, no sense\u201d objection unsound.\n\nThe argument will proceed in five steps. Sections 1 and 2 unpack and neutralise the core objection. Section 3 explains how clock mechanisms carry temporal information. Section 4 generalises the lesson to biological time-keeping and the putative human sense of duration. Section 5 addresses two residual worries\u2014drift and calibration\u2014that might still tempt one to deny the sensory status of temporal perception.\n\n1. The \u201ccausal contact\u201d model of perception  \n\nAt first glance, the objection has intuitive pull. Paradigmatic sensory modalities conform to a simple schema:\n\nEnvironmental feature  \u2794  Physical medium  \u2794  Receptor organ.\n\nLight reflected from a surface passes through the medium of air and strikes photoreceptors; airborne chemicals dissolve in mucus and bind to olfactory cilia; vibrations propagate through tissue to mechanoreceptors in the cochlea. In each case there is an energy transfer whose causal ancestry traces to the distal property seen, smelled, or heard. Because time is not an energetic property\u2014it does not radiate or vibrate\u2014it appears to fall outside this schema. No energy packet marked \u201c+5 ms\u201d can strike a neuron.\n\nCall this picture the Causal Contact Model (CCM). CCM\u2019s key premise:\n\n(CCM-P) To be sensed, a property must stand in a causal interaction with the sensory organ.\n\nIf CCM-P is true, and if time cannot so interact, then \u201csensing time\u201d is impossible. The premise is plausible but mistaken. It conflates two very different roles causation can play in perception: (a) transmitting a signal, and (b) underwriting a lawful correlation that makes the signal informative. Only the latter is indispensable.\n\n2. What information actually requires  \n\nIn the late 1970s, Fred Dretske proposed that a state S carries information that P just in case there is a lawful or probabilistically reliable dependency between S and P\u2014enough that the presence of S would not occur unless P were true (in the relevant range of worlds). Shannon\u2019s information theory makes an allied point in terms of mutual entropy reduction. Neither framework requires the target property to punch or poke the channel; what matters is counterfactual dependence under the appropriate laws. \n\nConsider two instructive analogies:\n\nThermometer: A mercury thermometer informs me the room is 21 \u00b0C. Does temperature \u201chit\u201d the glass? Not exactly. Mean molecular kinetic energy of air collides with the bulb, raising internal energy; the actual cause is molecular motion, not an ethereal property called temperature. Yet the mercury\u2019s height lawfully covaries with the very magnitude reported.\n\nSpace perception: Space itself is not causal either. Nothing called \u201cleftness\u201d pushes my retina. Nevertheless, disparity in retinal images lawfully correlates with spatial depth, allowing stereopsis. We comfortably speak of perceiving distance even though there is no causal force named \u201cdistance.\u201d \n\nThese cases reveal CCM-P to be too strict. Causation is required somewhere in the chain (molecular motion heats mercury, photons strike rods and cones), but not from the abstract property as such. What is needed is (i) a concrete process that changes state over time, and (ii) a stable mapping between that process and the magnitude to be represented. The same recipe works for time.\n\n3. How clocks tell time without time acting  \n\nA clock is any system whose states stand in a reliable one-to-one mapping with elapsed temporal intervals. There are roughly two components:\n\nPacemaker: an internal physical process that undergoes regular oscillations (phosphorous atom transitions, quartz crystal shear, pendular swing).\n\nAccumulator and readout: a gearing or electronic counter that translates the pacemaker\u2019s cycles into a usable variable (hand position, LED digits).\n\nWhy does a quartz crystal oscillate at 32 768 Hz? Because of the laws governing piezoelectric resonance, laws in which time appears parametrically. The oscillation is not \u201ccaused by time.\u201d It is caused by electro-mechanical tensions whose dynamics are time-dependent. The dependence is captured by differential equations in which t is a parameter. Given the laws L and initial conditions IC, the state S(t) of the quartz at time t is fixed. Hence:\n\nIf t were different, S(t) would be different.  \nTherefore S(t) counterfactually tracks t.  \n\nThat counterfactual dependency is sufficient for informational tracking. Observe the contrast with properties that truly cannot be sensed at all\u2014say, the parity of \u03c0\u2019s trillionth digit. There are no lawful regularities connecting that abstract numerical fact with everyday physical states; no mechanism could register it reliably. Time, by contrast, is built into every dynamical law. Wherever there is change, there is the possibility of an internal state that changes in tandem with elapsed duration. The world itself provides the clock signal.\n\nReturning to CCM, the crystal\u2019s harmony with t is mediated by law-governed causation internal to the device, not by any impingement from time. That suffices. The device embodies what philosophers of science call a \u201cnomic designator\u201d: a physical magnitude that designates an abstract parameter through the very laws of motion.\n\n4. Biological time perception  \n\nDoes the same story extend to organisms? Yes, though with familiar biological complications\u2014drift, noise, multisensory integration.\n\nPacemaker candidates abound:  \n\u2022 Circadian rhythms rely on transcription-translation feedback loops whose products inhibit their own synthesis with a roughly 24-hour delay.  \n\u2022 Neural oscillations in the striatum, cerebellum, and cortical gamma bands provide millisecond-to-second timers.  \n\u2022 The heart itself offers a coarse rhythm.  \n\nThese oscillators evolve in accordance with biochemical kinetics and electrophysiological dynamics. Because those dynamics are time-indexed, the organism\u2019s internal state changes lawfully with elapsed duration. Downstream circuitry\u2014often characterised as an \u201caccumulator\u201d or \u201ccounter\u201d\u2014integrates pulses until a threshold, triggering behaviour (press the lever after 2 s, migrate before winter). The mapping from accumulated pulses to time interval is established by evolutionary and learning-based calibration: states that mis-track time impose fitness costs and are selected against. \n\nCrucially, nothing in this picture treats time as a causal stimulus. Sensory reception of duration is endogenous: the organism monitors its own changing states. Yet that is equally true of interoceptive modalities like proprioception. Muscle spindle afferents inform one of limb position by detecting stretch, not by a force called \u201cposition.\u201d Time perception is structurally homologous.\n\n5. Two residual worries  \n\nWorry 1: Clock drift shows the mechanism does not genuinely sense time.  \n\nClocks drift when their internal dynamics deviate from the assumed mapping to t. But even canonical exteroceptive senses misrepresent: visual illusions, auditory masking, pheromone confusion. Fallibility is not evidence of non-sensory status. Biological clocks are continually recalibrated by exogenous cues\u2014light-dark cycles, social signals, feeding schedules. The presence of calibration pathways reinforces the sensory analogy: retinal ganglion cells projecting to the suprachiasmatic nucleus play for the circadian system the same role photoreceptors play for colour vision, namely, updating internal encodings with fresh causal inputs. \n\nWorry 2: If the \u201csignal\u201d is just internal change, don\u2019t we collapse the distinction between sensing and mere happening?  \n\nNo. The distinction lies in functional role. An oscillation in my liver that influences no further processing is a mere happening. An oscillation whose pulses are monitored by neural areas governing anticipation, planning, or motor coordination plays the information-bearing role distinctive of sensory signals. In cybernetic terms, the variable is part of the system\u2019s feedback loop. Organisms with damaged basal ganglia show impaired interval timing, just as those with damaged cochleae show hearing loss. The same diagnostic criteria (deficit on discrimination tasks, loss of calibration, incapacity to offset drift) support sensory attribution.\n\nConclusion  \n\nTime never enters a detector like photons enter an eye. That fact does not impugn the possibility of a sensory system for time because sensing, in the information-theoretic sense relevant to cognitive science, requires counterfactual-lawful dependence, not literal causal aggression by the target property. Clocks\u2014whether quartz watches or neuronal circuits\u2014instantiate regular processes whose states map onto elapsed duration under the governing dynamical laws. Those mappings endow the states with temporal content. Biological organisms tap into such mappings via pacemaker-accumulator architectures, calibrating them with external cues. Hence the \u201ccausal impotence\u201d objection fails: one can sense time in virtue of being a temporally evolving system that lawfully encodes how much time has evolved.\n\nApproximate word count: 1,050.", "output_tokens": 2712, "reasoning_tokens": 640}

Framing the Objection  \n\nContemporary philosophy of perception often treats the senses as causal intermediaries between worldly properties and the perceiver. Vision works because light strikes photoreceptors; audition because pressure waves move the basilar membrane; olfaction because volatile molecules bind to cilia. Many therefore reason: \u201cIf there were a sense of time, time itself would have to impinge on a receptor in the same way. But time exerts no forces, so there can be no genuine time-sense.\u201d The target objection is not merely an empirical hunch but a conceptual claim: temporal representation seems ruled out by the very definition of perception-as-causal-registration.  \n\nI shall defend a contrary thesis. There can be (and is) perceptual representation of temporal intervals even though time never serves as a proximate cause. Clock mechanisms\u2014both artefactual and neural\u2014carry information about time by exploiting lawful correlations between their internal dynamics and objective temporal structure. The correlation, not direct causal \u201cpressure\u201d from time, secures the representational link. Once we distinguish (i) being the cause of a signal from (ii) fixing a reliable correlation class that the perceiver can exploit, the objection loses its grip. In what follows I (A) clarify how information can flow without the tracked magnitude being a causal force; (B) analyse clock mechanisms as paradigms of such tracking; (C) extend the lesson to biological time-sense; and (D) address residual worries about error, calibration, and explanatory circularity.  \n\n2. Causation versus Information  \n\nBegin with a mundane instrument: a mercury thermometer. Temperature, like time, is not itself a force. What does the pushing is molecular motion, which\u2014via collisions\u2014expands the mercury. Nonetheless we happily say that the thermometer \u201cregisters temperature.\u201d Philosophers after Dretske capture this by appealing to nomic covariance: mercury column height H carries the information that the ambient temperature is T because, under stable background conditions, P(H|T) = 1. A detector need only be causally affected by some chain that lawfully depends on the magnitude in question; the magnitude need not appear as a separate causal factor.  \n\nThe anti-time-sense objection conflates two theses:  \n\n1. Perception requires causal influence.  \n2. The represented property itself must be the causal influencer.  \n\nBut 2 is false. A barometer is influenced by air molecules striking a diaphragm, not by \u201cpressure-in-the-abstract\u201d; a Geiger counter is triggered by ionising particles, not by \u201cradioactivity\u201d per se. Likewise, temporal measurement hinges on physical processes whose rates are law-governed with respect to time. This loosening from direct property causation is already endemic to our theory of instruments. Clocks simply generalise the pattern.  \n\n3. How Clocks Track Time  \n\nEvery clock has two components:  \n\na. A regular physical process\u2014swinging pendulum, quartz oscillation, caesium-atom hyperfine transition\u2014whose state cycles with period \u03c4.  \nb. A counting or integrating mechanism that maps successive cycles onto larger-scale representational states (\u201c3 : 47 pm,\u201d \u201c400 ms elapsed\u201d).  \n\nThe crucial property of the oscillator is dynamical invariance: given background conditions C, the number of completed cycles N within an interval is highly reliably proportional to the objective duration \u0394t (N = \u0394t/\u03c4). The clock\u2019s reading carries the information that \u0394t = N\u03c4 because (a) N is causally produced by the oscillator, and (b) the oscillator\u2019s behaviour is lawfully correlated with \u0394t. Time does no causal work beyond underwriting the laws that specify how physical systems evolve.  \n\nPut schematically:  \n\nLaw L: For system S in conditions C, if S undergoes K state transitions, duration elapsed = K\u03c4.  \n\nThe pointer reading is caused by those K transitions; duration is inferred from L. No extra \u201ctemporal particle\u201d need hit the escapement. Instrument scientists call this a \u201csecondary standard\u201d: you tie an easily observable variable (pendulum angle, quartz voltage) to a quantity (time) that figures in the equation of motion.  \n\n4. Avoiding Vicious Circularity  \n\nA frequent rejoinder is: \u201cYou assume the pendulum\u2019s period is one second, but that is defined in terms of time; isn\u2019t that circular?\u201d The worry confuses epistemic calibration with metaphysical dependence. Of course we need an independent procedure\u2014say, astronomical observations of the Earth\u2019s rotation\u2014to set \u03c4. But once calibrated, the pendulum continues to track duration via its own dynamics. The fact that measurement epistemology is relational does not impugn the metaphysical point that causation flows through physical forces, while representation accrues by lawful correlation. (Compare: we first determine that mercury expands 0.00018 of its length per degree Celsius; thereafter the thermometer registers temperature without circularity.)  \n\n5. Biological Clocks and Human Time-Sense  \n\nHuman and animal timing provides an instructive naturalistic counterpart. Two empirical paradigms dominate:  \n\n\u2022 Circadian timing (~24 h). Molecular feedback loops in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) produce rhythmic gene expression. Light pulses entrain the loop, but day-to-day ticking is endogenously generated.  \n\n\u2022 Interval timing (milliseconds to minutes). The \u201cpacemaker-accumulator\u201d model posits a neural oscillator (possibly striatal dopaminergic bursts) whose pulses are gated to an accumulator when the organism initiates timing.  \n\nIn neither case is \u201ctime\u201d pressing on receptors. The causal work is done by molecular transcription cycles or neuron firing. Yet experiments show rats anticipate a reward at 10 s; humans tap in synchrony with 600 ms metronomes; SCN lesions disrupt sleep-wake cycles. These are canonical perceptual phenomena: detection, discrimination, and adaptation. The brain\u2019s internal oscillators play the same role the quartz crystal does in a wristwatch.  \n\n6. Anticipating Objections  \n\nObjection 1: Covariance is cheap; any reliably functioning mechanism could be described as time-sensitive. Doesn\u2019t that trivialise perception?  \nReply: Perception requires not just covariance but availability for real-time control. A representation must be poised for integration with action-guidance systems (Dretske\u2019s \u201cstructural\u201d constraint, Neander\u2019s \u201cteleological\u201d one). SCN outputs modulate alertness; interval timers guide lever-presses. The information is exploited, not merely correlated.  \n\nObjection 2: If time is not a cause, how can misrepresentation occur? Clocks can run slow. What makes a reading false if not failure of causal contact with time?  \nReply: Representational error arises when the correlation embodied in Law L is broken by interfering conditions C*. A pendulum clock transported to high altitude lengthens its seconds because g is lower, violating the assumption about background conditions. Similarly, dopaminergic drugs speed up the neural pacemaker, leading subjects to over-estimate intervals. Misrepresentation is thus defined relative to the law-grounded correlation, not to missing \u201ctemporal contact.\u201d  \n\nObjection 3: In vision and audition, the stimulus energies are themselves structured; the retina receives a 2-D image. What is the \u201cstimulus structure\u201d for time?  \nReply: The stimulus is the phase of the oscillator at the moment of sampling. Phase is not a force but a dynamical state variable, just as wavelength is a spatial variable. Different senses exploit different state spaces: spatial layout for vision, spectral composition for audition, phase trajectory for timing. The formal property of phase supports discrimination among intervals exactly as hue supports discrimination among wavelengths.  \n\n7. The Sense/Instrument Continuum  \n\nAt this point one might concede that oscillatory clocks gather information but deny that this yields a sense \u201cproper.\u201d Senses, it might be argued, are exteroceptive; internal clocks are more akin to proprioception or inference. The line, however, is porous. Thermoception detects internal tissue temperature, yet it is uncontroversially sensory. Nor do we demand a dedicated peripheral receptor for every sense: vestibular hair cells reside in the inner ear and track angular acceleration of the head, an endogenous feature relative to the torso. The better criterion is functional: if a subsystem delivers information in a format available to perceptual cognition, it counts as sensory. The cortical network involving basal ganglia and supplementary motor area displays classic sensory hallmarks\u2014feature selectivity (specific interval tuning), adaptation, cross-modal transfer\u2014warranting the label.  \n\n8. Lessons from Instrumental Design  \n\nPhilosophers sometimes overlook a treasure trove of conceptual guidance in engineering practice. Instrument designers routinely separate:  \n\n(i) The measurand (quantity to be measured).  \n(ii) The transduction principle (physical process that converts the measurand into a detectable signal).  \n(iii) The readout.  \n\nFor timekeeping, (i) is duration, (ii) is periodicity of a chosen oscillator, (iii) is pointer position or digital code. Every dimension we measure\u2014mass, temperature, time\u2014relies on this tri-layer. The fact that only (ii) is directly causal does not impede (i)\u2019s successful measurement. Hence, denying time-sensing on causal grounds would equally undermine thermometry and weighing. Rather than treat time as a special case, we should acknowledge that all measurement is mediation.  \n\n9. Beyond Covariance: Counterfactual Support  \n\nA critic might accept law-governed covariance yet insist that real representation requires counterfactual dependence: had the duration been different, the system would have indicated differently. Clocks meet this standard. Vary the length of the interval, and the pendulum will swing more or fewer times. The device\u2019s correctness is subserved by a causal model that supports counterfactual inferences. Time-sense in animals likewise shows flexible generalisation: rats trained on 10-s intervals adjust behaviour when the interval is shifted to 15 s, evidencing counterfactual sensitivity rather than rigid entrainment.  \n\n10. Does Time\u2019s \u201cCausal Impotence\u201d Matter?  \n\nThe initial objection trades on an equivocation. Time is causally impotent in the sense that nothing pushes because of time over and above ordinary forces. Yet time is causally omnipresent in the sense that every law of motion is time-indexed. An oscillator\u2019s evolution through state space just is the physical manifestation of the passage of time. Saying \u201ctime causes nothing\u201d is like saying \u201cspace causes nothing,\u201d yet spatial relations are plainly perceived when photons carry structure governed by geometry. Similarly, temporal relations are perceived when dynamical evolutions carry structure governed by kinematics.  \n\n11. Integration with Multimodal Perception  \n\nAn independent consideration for time-sensing comes from multisensory binding. Audio-visual simultaneity judgments and the flash-beep illusion reveal a modality-independent temporal metric. Neural oscillatory measures (gamma-phase locking) serve as the common reference frame. The success of integration would be inexplicable if each modality merely delivered uninterpreted phase codes. The brain houses a supra-modal timer\u2014an internal clock\u2014into which different sensory signals are mapped. Again, the representational function is secured not by temporal \u201ccontact\u201d but by shared covariant dynamics.  \n\n12. The Metaphysical Moral  \n\nA metaphysical temptation lies beneath the causal objection: imagining \u201cthe passage of time\u201d as a substance that would have to impinge on sensors. Once we reject substantival passage, the puzzle dissolves. On a relational view, time is an order of events; tracking that order is just tracking patterns in events. Clocks, biological or mechanical, are themselves events arranged in repeatable sequences. Representation is achieved when one repeatable sequence is harnessed to witness another.  \n\n13. Summing Up  \n\nWe can now restate the rebuttal succinctly.  \n\nPremise 1: A system represents a magnitude M if it contains a state S that lawfully covaries with M under suitable background conditions and is available for the organism\u2019s use.  \n\nPremise 2: Periodic physical processes lawfully covary with temporal duration by virtue of the dynamics of the world.  \n\nPremise 3: Clock mechanisms (artefactual and biological) contain states that covary with duration and are used for anticipatory action, decision, and coordination.  \n\nConclusion: Therefore, clock mechanisms represent temporal duration; a genuine sense of time is possible without time causally impacting receptors.  \n\nThe causal requirement on perception is satisfied because the internal oscillator\u2019s state is caused by physical forces; the representational requirement is satisfied because the oscillator\u2019s evolution covaries with the external temporal order. The objection fails by mistaking direct causal pressure for the broader informational relation that underwrites all measurement.  \n\n14. Broader Implications  \n\nRecognising time-sensing reshapes debates about consciousness and temporal phenomenology. If the brain harbours dedicated timing circuits, subjective flow may be partially grounded in their operation, demystifying the elusive \u201cspecious present.\u201d Moreover, artificial intelligence systems can inherit the same design principle: embed an oscillator, calibrate it, and you endow the machine with temporal awareness adequate for action.  \n\nThe philosophical take-home is methodological. When evaluating whether a property can be perceived, we must disentangle causal transduction from informational correlation, and we must situate biological sensing within the wider engineering paradigm of measurement. Doing so reveals that the \u201ccausal impotence\u201d of time is no more a barrier to its perception than the causal impotence of pressure or temperature is to barometry and thermometry. Far from being an anomalous sense, temporal perception exemplifies a general strategy: use regular internal dynamics as a mirror for an abstract relational magnitude.  \n\n15. Conclusion  \n\nThe spectre of causal impotence dissolves once we see that perception hinges on reliable linkage, not on direct impact by the represented property qua property. Clocks\u2014mechanical, atomic, or neural\u2014function by embedding in their own causal evolution a signature that stands in stable correspondence with elapsed durations. Information flows along the causal chain of physical forces; representation flows from lawful correlation. Time need not shove the hand of the clock any more than temperature need shove the mercury. Hence, the existence of a genuine sensory system for time is not only conceptually possible but empirically instantiated in both our artefacts and our nervous systems.", "output_tokens": 3490, "reasoning_tokens": 448}

Framing the Objection  \n\nThe objection can be sharpened like this:\n\nP1\u2003Sensory systems represent a property F only if F itself causally affects the system.  \nP2\u2003Time, unlike photons or sound waves, cannot causally impinge on a mechanism.  \nC\u2003Therefore no genuine sensory system can represent time. Any appearance that we \u201csense\u201d time is merely cognitive inference or memory, not sensation.\n\nThe conclusion looks powerful because it trades on an intuitive picture of sensing as passive registration: light strikes the retina, molecules bind to olfactory receptors, pressure deforms the skin. Nothing seems to \u201cstrike\u201d a time-sensor. Hence, no time-sense.\n\nI shall argue that P1 is false: a system can carry information about\u2014and so, in a perfectly respectable sense, \u201csense\u201d\u2014a property even when that property is not itself among the causal forces acting on the system. What matters is not \u201cdirect causal impingement by F\u201d but reliable causal covariation with F, where the reliability is underwritten by law-like regularities. Clocks, both artificial and biological, exemplify this. Once P1 is rejected, the rest of the objection collapses.\n\nII. Clarifying the Target: What Would \u201cSensing Time\u201d Amount To?  \n\nWe need to keep apart three questions that often get run together:\n\n1. Representation: can a mechanism\u2019s internal states stand for (carry information about) temporal magnitudes such as duration or temporal order?  \n2. Causation: must those states be produced by causal chains that include \u201ctime\u201d as a *cause*?  \n3. Phenomenology: can such mechanisms give rise to a distinctive temporal phenomenology (the feeling of duration, flow, simultaneity)?\n\nThe objection equivocates between (1) and (2). It correctly notes that \u201ctime\u201d is not a cause. But (1) does not require that; reliable *covariation* suffices. My focus will be on (1) and (2); phenomenology can ride on whatever answer we give to them.\n\nIII. Information Without Direct Causal Impact: Dretske\u2019s Lesson  \n\nFred Dretske (1981) proposed an influential information-theoretic semantics: a signal R carries information that S is F just in case, under a suitable background condition C, the probability of S\u2019s being F given that R occurs is 1 (or very high). Crucially, R need not be caused *by F itself*. What is needed is that, within background C, R would not occur unless S were F.\n\nExample: A speedometer needle\u2019s location represents the car\u2019s speed, but the causal pathway involves rotational frequency of the driveshaft, magnetic fields in the torsion spring, and so on. \u201cSpeed\u201d does not push the needle; the needle covaries with speed because of a lawful relation fixed by the device\u2019s design and the laws of mechanics.\n\nIf Dretske is even roughly right, P1 is mistaken. Representation requires lawful covariation, not direct causal impact by the represented property.\n\nIV. Clocks: How a Mechanism Can Represent Time  \n\nConsider a pendulum clock. Its hands advance in step with the oscillations of the pendulum; each swing triggers a gear movement that displaces the minute hand by a fixed arc. Let state H\u2099 be the hand\u2019s pointing at the n-th minute mark. For normal environmental conditions (constant gravity, negligible friction) the following counterfactual holds:\n\nIf the mechanism is in state H\u2099 at t, then n minutes have elapsed since calibration.\n\nThat is enough, in Dretske\u2019s sense, for H\u2099 to carry information about elapsed time. No swing is *caused by time itself*; swings are caused by gravity, inertia, and escapement mechanics. Yet thanks to the law g = 4\u03c0\u00b2L/T\u00b2, the period T remains constant. The designer exploits this law to forge a stable R\u2013F mapping: pendulum swings \u2194 equal temporal intervals.\n\nThe same pattern recurs in quartz watches (where piezoelectric oscillations replace gravity), atomic clocks (hyperfine transitions), circadian pacemakers in neurons (feedback loops of gene expression), and millisecond timers in cerebellar Purkinje cells (metabotropic cascades). All are *self-sustained oscillators* whose internal dynamics provide a yardstick for duration.\n\nV. A Parity Argument: Temperature, Not Just Time  \n\nIf the objection were sound, it would equally undermine the possibility of sensing temperature. Temperature is a statistical property of molecular motion; it is not itself a causal entity. Yet thermometers work. Mercury expands because individual molecules collide with it more vigorously at higher mean kinetic energy. The representation is indirect\u2014but perfectly legitimate.\n\nSo either we deny that thermometers (or the skin\u2019s thermoreceptors) sense temperature, or we concede that sensing need not involve causal impingement by the represented magnitude as such. Parity pushes us toward the latter, rescuing a time sense.\n\nVI. Biological Timing: Evidence of Dedicated Mechanisms  \n\nThere is converging evidence for at least three partially dissociable timing systems in organisms:\n\n1. Circadian (~24 h). Suprachiasmatic nucleus neurons maintain self-sustained gene-protein feedback loops; lesions obliterate daily rhythms even when the animal remains otherwise sensorimotorly intact.\n2. Interval timing (~500 ms to minutes). Striatal beat-frequency models explain how cortical oscillations in the beta-gamma range are detected and counted by medium spiny neurons, producing scalar timing behavior that obeys Weber\u2019s law.\n3. Millisecond timing (<300 ms). Cerebellar microcomplexes learn precisely timed pauses in Purkinje cell firing, crucial for tasks like eyeblink conditioning.\n\nAll three systems satisfy the key requirement: their states covary, lawfully and calibratably, with elapsed time. Pharmacological manipulation of dopamine selectively distorts perceived interval duration; cooling the cerebellum selectively stretches sub-second timing. These double dissociations show that the timing is not merely a by-product of generic cognitive processes; there are specialized \u201cclock\u201d circuits.\n\nVII. Addressing Objections  \n\nObjection 1: Covariation may be *accidental*. Reliance on lawful covariation only works if background conditions are stable; friction will slow a pendulum clock.\n\nReply: True, but the same is so for vision (fog degrades accuracy) and temperature sensing (thermoreceptors saturate). Imperfect covariation does not void representation; it merely introduces noise. What is needed is *counterfactual-supporting* regularity within normal operating conditions.\n\nObjection 2: A self-oscillator measures only itself. Without anchoring to external events, it cannot tell *objective* time.\n\nReply: Most biological clocks are *entrained* by external cues. Circadian clocks entrain to the light\u2013dark cycle; interval timers are reset by stimulus onset; cerebellar timers are calibrated by climbing-fiber teaching signals. The system\u2019s own oscillations provide a metric; environmental events provide start/stop markers. This hybrid solves the \u201cmerely internal\u201d worry.\n\nObjection 3: Even if clocks represent time, human temporal phenomenology\u2014the felt flow\u2014is illusory and thus not \u201csensed\u201d.\n\nReply: The objection slides from representation to qualia. My claim is not that we have a dedicated \u201cduration receptor\u201d analogous to rods in the retina, but that sensory-like mechanisms furnish the nervous system with non-inferential information about temporal magnitudes. How that information is rendered phenomenally is a further, still-open question. The existence of illusions (e.g., time dilation under arousal) shows fallibility, not absence, of a sense.\n\nVIII. Distinguishing Two Kinds of Temporal Representation  \n\nA useful distinction (analogous to Marr\u2019s \u201cwhat vs. where\u201d) separates:\n\nA. Metric time: how much interval has elapsed.  \nB. Ordinal time: what is the order of events.\n\nStatic perceptual snapshots plus memory suffice for B; sensing A requires oscillatory or decay processes whose own *physics* depends on time-rate parameters. The objection we began with targets A. My response shows that metric time can be sensed via mechanisms whose state-transitions are governed by rate-constants (k) that are, in the relevant equations, functions of time. The system does not need time to be a cause; it needs its own state changes to unfold lawfully with regard to time.\n\nIX. A Positive Proposal: the Law-Exploiting Account of Temporal Sensing  \n\nI propose the following sufficient condition:\n\nA mechanism M counts as a *temporal sensory system* for organism O over interval domain D iff:\n\n1. M possesses a physical process P whose state S(t) evolves according to a law L containing an explicit temporal parameter (e.g., dS/dt = f(S)).  \n2. There is a calibration procedure C such that, after C, specific values of S(t) reliably co-vary with temporal magnitudes in D under normal background conditions B.  \n3. Downstream consumers (neural or artifactual) use S(t) non-inferentially to guide behavior that is sensitive to temporal magnitudes\u2014e.g., anticipatory motor commands, foraging timing, speech parsing.\n\nConditions (1) and (2) guarantee the Dretske-style information link; (3) gives it the \u201conline\u201d flavor distinctive of sensory as opposed to post-hoc cognitive systems.\n\nThis account explains both artificial clocks and biological timing nuclei. It also predicts that if we could implant an artificial oscillator in an animal\u2019s brain, entrain it to external time, and demonstrate that the animal used its phase angle to guide behavior, we would have literally given the animal a *new temporal sense* (say, a 90-minute ultradian sense). That is an empirically testable\u2014and philosophically gratifying\u2014prediction.\n\nX. Wider Implications: Revising Our Taxonomy of Senses  \n\nAccepting temporal sensory systems fits with a more general, naturalistic taxonomy of sense modalities based on the *kind of information* extracted, not the superficial receptor type. On such a view, proprioception, nociception, and magnetoreception join the roster alongside vision and audition; time-sense and numerosity-sense have an equal claim. The causal-impingement criterion was always too restrictive.\n\nXI. Conclusion  \n\nThe initial objection mislocates the explanatory burden. Representation depends on reliable covariation supported by physical law, not on the represented magnitude\u2019s being a causal force. Time, though causally impotent, figures in the laws governing oscillatory processes; clever organisms (and clockmakers) exploit those laws to build mechanisms whose states map systematically onto durations. Because the mapping is calibrated and used online to guide action, such mechanisms qualify as genuine sensory systems for time. Pendulum clocks, quartz watches, and the suprachiasmatic nucleus all testify that one can *sense time* without time ever lifting a causal finger.", "output_tokens": 2969, "reasoning_tokens": 640}

A tempting view\u2014call it the Causal Impingement Requirement\u2014says that to sense X the sensory organ must be struck by X.  Since time never strikes, there can be no sense of time and no genuine temporal detectors.  Clocks may *keep* time, the objection continues, but only by tracking some other causal factor (oscillations in quartz, radioactive decay, etc.).  They get temporal facts \u201cfor free,\u201d as an accidental by-product of processes that are *really* driven by forces like electromagnetism.  On this view, both artefactual clocks and the brain\u2019s \u201cinner chronometer\u201d piggy-back on genuinely causal signals; they never register time *itself*.\n\nI shall argue that the objection mis-describes what any detector must do.  No sensory system\u2014visual, thermal, chemical, or temporal\u2014requires causal influence *from* the abstract property it detects; what it needs is causal *covariation* with that property.  Covariation can arise because (i) there is a lawlike relation between some directly causal process and the property to be measured, and (ii) the system has evolved, learned, or been engineered to exploit that lawful relation.  In that sense a clock measures time exactly as a thermometer measures temperature or a Geiger counter measures radioactivity: not via \u201cimpingement\u201d by an abstraction, but via reliable internal dynamics that lawfully mirror the target magnitude.  Once this point is clear, the \u201ccausal impotence of time\u201d objection dissolves.\n\nI develop the response in four steps.\n\n1.  Diagnosing the error in the Causal Impingement Requirement.\n2.  Showing how artefactual clocks encode temporal information through self-causation plus lawlike regularities.\n3.  Extending the same model to neurobiological timing mechanisms, thereby vindicating a genuine sense of time.\n4.  Addressing three residual worries: about calibration, representation, and phenomenal temporality.\n\nThroughout, I distinguish carefully between (a) causal forces, (b) abstract properties, and (c) the information-carrying structures that underwrite representation.  Conflating these three\u2014treating causal impact by a property as the only grounds for sensing it\u2014produces the illusion that time is special.  It is not.\n\n1.  The Causal Impingement Requirement Is Over-Strong  \n\nVision is often introduced as paradigm case: photons emitted or reflected by distal objects strike photoreceptors, triggering a neural cascade.  A superficial lesson is that the sensed property itself, light, \u201chits\u201d the organ.  But reflection shows that even in vision we do not detect *colors* or *shapes* by being causally bombarded by those entities.  Photons have frequencies; \u201credness\u201d is an abstraction we read off from a pattern of neuronal firings that covaries, by law, with frequency.  A fortiori, a thermometer senses temperature though temperature never presses on mercury.  What presses are molecules that exchange kinetic energy; the device relies on the gas-law correlation between average kinetic energy and macroscopic expansion.  Likewise barometers, smoke alarms, and pH strips sense pressure, combustion risk, and acidity without being struck by \u201cpressure,\u201d \u201cdanger,\u201d or \u201cacidity\u201d as such.\n\nSo the Causal Impingement Requirement exaggerates.  What any sensor needs is this:\n\n   Reliable Covariation Condition  \n   The sensor\u2019s states stand in a counterfactual-supporting, lawlike mapping to the environmental magnitudes it purports to measure.\n\nThat mapping may be mediated through forces that the sensor does feel, but the *target property* need not itself exert any primitive force.  Temperature is a statistical abstraction over many forces; acidity is a concentration ratio; risk is modal.  Time, too, is an ordering relation plus a metric on events.  The fact that it is abstract does not bar lawful covariation with physical processes.\n\n2.  How Artefactual Clocks Encode Elapsed Time  \n\nConsider a wristwatch with a quartz crystal oscillating at 32,768 Hz, driving digital circuitry that counts cycles, advances gear trains, and moves hands.  Elapsed-time information ends up in the hand positions.  What grounds their representational content?\n\nStep 1:  Self-causation.  The state S(t+\u0394t) of the crystal is causally determined by S(t) plus the crystal\u2019s physical parameters.  As long as the law \u201cfor every cycle, next inversion occurs after ~30.5 \u03bcs\u201d holds, later states carry information about how many cycles have transpired since a reference zero.\n\nStep 2:  Lawlike connection to the time dimension.  Quantum mechanics and solid-state physics guarantee that each period takes one fixed unit of proper time.  Thus a simple causal chain\u2014current cycle \u2190 previous cycle \u2190 \u2026 \u2190 initial trigger\u2014mirrors the passage of time even though *time* neither pushes nor pulls.  The \u201cpush\u201d comes from inter-molecular forces inside the crystal; the mapping from number of cycles to minutes is conceptual rather than causal.\n\nStep 3:  Decoding convention.  Human observers treat one full rotation of the minute hand as encoding 60 minutes because (a) we built the watch with gear ratios that enforce that mapping and (b) we stand ready to interpret the hand\u2019s angle accordingly.  That convention turns the brute causal covariation into something epistemically useful.\n\nNotice the general pattern: causal dynamics reflect a parameter that does no direct causal work.  The mechanism\u2019s initial state\u2014call it a time stamp\u2014causally screens off earlier environmental influences.  All subsequent \u201cinformation flow\u201d about elapsed time is via the internal succession of states.  Yet that is sufficient for the watch to indicate time, and for us to learn the time by looking.\n\nA skeptic might reply: \u201cYou have shown only that the watch\u2019s later states covary with cumulative counts of oscillations, not with time itself.  Time enters only via our head, as the ratio 2^15 cycles = 1 second.\u201d  But this underestimates the information already in the causal chain.  By Shannon\u2019s criterion, a signal carries information about X if variation in X would, under the governing laws, produce systematic variation in the signal.  If the rate of proper time flow sped up or slowed down\u2014holding crystal physics fixed\u2014the period of oscillation would change and the watch would drift.  So the watch\u2019s states counterfactually depend on elapsed time.  That is enough for information-theoretic content even before any human conventions.\n\n3.  Biological Clocks and the Sense of Time  \n\nDo brains work the same way?  Ethology suggests yes.  Songbirds control syllable duration to within milliseconds; rats learn to nose-poke exactly eight seconds after a cue; human subjects can tap rhythms with <2% variance.  These feats invoke internal timing circuits comprising:\n\n   a.  Pacemakers: oscillatory neural populations (e.g., striatal neurons entrained by dopamine).  \n   b.  Accumulators or integrators: cortical or cerebellar circuits that sum spikes.  \n   c.  Memory registers: hippocampal traces of start signals.  \n   d.  Comparison modules: frontal networks that check current sum against stored interval criteria.\n\nNo external temporal \u201cstimulus\u201d impinges.  The system exploits reliable autocausal dynamics: pacemaker period \u2248 10 ms; accumulator leakage constant k; etc.  Because these constants are themselves functions of metabolic temperature, neurotransmitter balance, and so on, the brain also employs exteroceptive cues (day\u2013night cycles, heartbeat, footsteps) to recalibrate.  But the point is that elapsed-time information is present *in* the unfolding state of the network.  As long as the organism has learned the mapping \u201cN spikes \u2248 1 s,\u201d it can read its own state to guide behavior\u2014start running, stop pecking, begin a syllable.\n\nHence there is nothing metaphysically peculiar about a sense of time.  It is simply an internalized version of the quartz-watch story, using biological oscillators in place of crystal lattices.  Time need not push on neurons any more than temperature pushes on mercury.  What matters is lawful, counterfactual-supporting covariation plus an evolved decoding routine.\n\n4.  Residual Worries  \n\na.  Calibration:  What anchors the scale?  \n   All clocks\u2014artefactual or neural\u2014are prone to drift because the pacemaker period is fixed only *ceteris paribus.*  Organisms therefore anchor their internal timers to salient environmental periodicities: sunrise, circadian melatonin spikes, the 1/f structure of ambient sound.  Artefactual clocks rely on international atomic standards.  Calibration is essential but no more mysterious for time than for thermometers, which require fixed points (melting ice, boiling water).\n\nb.  Representation versus mere covariation  \n   Some philosophers argue that lawlike covariation is insufficient for *representation*; swamp-thermometers could register temperature without representing it.  Suppose we accept a richer teleosemantic condition: a state represents X when selected or designed *in part* because it carries information about X.  Biological clocks satisfy that too: natural selection favors organisms whose internal states stand in a mapping to objective time because that mapping guides activity (foraging, predator avoidance).  Human-built clocks satisfy the design clause as well.  So representation is secured.\n\nc.  Phenomenological time  \n   Someone can grant informational content yet protest that subjective flow\u2014the \u201cspecious present,\u201d felt duration, the gaze of consciousness\u2014remains unexplained.  Fair point: establishing a sensory *system* for time does not by itself solve the hard problem of temporal qualia.  But notice that the Causal Impingement objection targeted *any* sensory basis whatsoever.  Showing that the brain has reliable temporal detectors removes that negative argument, opening conceptual space for empirically tractable models of temporal consciousness (e.g., Grush\u2019s \u201ctrajectory estimation,\u201d Buonomano\u2019s state-dependent networks).\n\nConclusion  \n\nThe objection that \u201ctime cannot be sensed because it never exerts causal pressure\u201d mistakes the job description of a detector.

Introduction: framing the objection\n\nThere is something initially compelling about the \u201ccausal impotence\u201d objection. Photons striking rods and cones, airborne chemicals binding to olfactory receptors, and pressure waves deforming the basilar membrane are paradigmatic cases in which what is sensed directly exerts causal pressure on the sense organ. Time\u2014understood as the dimension along which events are ordered earlier-than and later-than\u2014appears unlike light, odor, or force. It does not \u201cpress\u201d on anything. Hence, the argument goes, there can be no genuine sensory system for time, and mechanisms that purport to represent it (biological clocks, wristwatches, circadian pacemakers) must do something other than sense.\n\nI shall argue that the objection rests on a mistaken picture of how informational representation works. A mechanism can carry information about a magnitude without being causally acted upon by that magnitude itself; tight, law-governed covariation is enough. Clocks\u2014whether quartz, atomic, or neural\u2014exploit internal processes whose evolutions map, with a lawful regularity, onto temporal intervals. Because of that mapping, their internal states are usable by organisms and engineers alike to guide time-sensitive behavior. Once the representational condition is made clear, the alleged causal impotence of time ceases to threaten the possibility of a sensory system dedicated to it. What follows develops this reply in six steps.\n\n2. Do sensory systems always require direct environmental causation?\n\nBegin with a conceptual housekeeping point: even in uncontroversial modalities, the property represented is often not the property that directly causes receptor activity. Photons do not cause the brain\u2019s representation of \u201cred\u201d by virtue of their intrinsic redness; they cause hyperpolarizations that covary, under the right conditions, with surface reflectances peaking at ~650 nm. Similarly, pain receptors fire not because \u201cdamage\u201d literally presses on them but because tissue deformation triggers ionic currents that correlate with potential injury. The philosophical moral\u2014drawn by Dretske, Fodor, and Millikan in different idioms\u2014is that sensory systems traffic in reliable correlations, not direct property-to-neuron pushing.\n\nInstrumental cases make the same point starkly. A mercury thermometer represents temperature by the height of a column of liquid. Strictly speaking, degrees Celsius never exert force on the glass. Molecular motion alters volume, which displaces mercury, which moves the meniscus. Yet we are perfectly happy to say the thermometer senses temperature. Whatever philosophical account one favors\u2014indicator semantics, teleosemantics, predictive coding\u2014the device qualifies as an information-bearing system for temperature despite the absence of a \u201ctemperature force.\u201d\n\nSo even if time really were causally inert, that would not by itself preclude a sensory coding of temporality. The real question is whether mechanisms exist whose internal states reliably covary with temporal structure so that they can function, biologically or instrumentally, as time indicators.\n\n3. Is time causally impotent?\n\nThe objection\u2019s persuasiveness partly derives from a verbal slide. Physicists treat temporal order as a structural aspect of every causal interaction; philosophers of causation sometimes speak of time as the \u201cstage\u201d rather than an actor. From that it is inferred that time lacks the oomph to impinge upon matter. But the same could be said of space: spatial relations are not entities that slam into receptors either, yet we possess robust spatial perception. The retina is not causally poked by \u201cleftness.\u201d Instead, patterns of photic input covary with spatial layout, and neural processing extracts the relevant information.\n\nMoreover, the claim that time is wholly causally impotent outruns physics. What makes a pendulum bob complete a cycle in one second is a complex of causal regularities linking length, gravitational acceleration, and inertial mass. Those regularities are expressed as equations with explicit temporal parameters (t). While one hesitates to say \u201ctime causes the oscillation,\u201d temporal metrics are built into the causal laws governing the system. The difference between one-second and two-second periods is causally effective in the sense that it figures in the nomic explanation of the bob\u2019s trajectory.\n\nStill, glossing this debate is unnecessary for our purposes. Grant the strongest reading of the objection\u2014that time itself never exerts a force. The response I shall defend requires only the weaker premise: causal covariation can arise without the target property\u2019s directly impacting the representing mechanism. That premise is already accepted in the thermometer and photoreceptor cases. Therefore, even if time remains a \u201cfree rider\u201d on more basic forces, it can be represented.\n\n4. How clocks carry temporal information\n\n4.1. The abstract recipe\n\nA minimal clock consists of two components:\n\na) A periodic or steadily accumulating physical process whose dynamics are highly regular across environmental contexts (the \u201coscillator\u201d or \u201ctimebase\u201d).\n\nb) A read-out mechanism that counts cycles, measures accumulated change, or samples the state of the oscillator to deliver a usable magnitude.\n\nIf (a) unfolds with sufficient stability and (b) links particular oscillator states to particular elapsed-time magnitudes, then, by Dretskean lights, the clock state R carries the information that time t has elapsed: P(t|R) \u2248 1, given background conditions C in which the device was designed or selected.\n\nFor a quartz wristwatch, microcrystalline lattice vibrations at 32 768 Hz serve as (a). An electronic circuit divides the oscillations until one pulse per second is achieved, and stepper motors drive the hands: (b). For an atomic clock, transitions between hyperfine energy states in cesium play the oscillator role, counted by microwaves tuned to 9 192 631 770 Hz. For the circadian clock in mammals, gene-protein feedback loops in the suprachiasmatic nucleus produce approximately 24-hour oscillations; neural and hormonal pathways propagate phase information to peripheral tissues.\n\nIn none of these cases does \u201ctime\u201d bat the mechanism like a ping-pong ball. Nonetheless their states are temporally informative because, given the laws governing quartz lattices, cesium atoms, or molecular feedback, the physical evolution of the system stands in a fixed mapping relation to objective temporal intervals. The metaphysical bridge is nomic rather than direct causal impact.\n\n4.2. Structural representation\n\nSome philosophers (Cummins, Ramsey, G\u0142adziejewski) prefer to explicate representation in terms of structural similarity or \u201cisomorphism\u201d used in a driving task. The pendulum clock\u2019s escapement wheel progresses one tooth per swing; the angular displacement of the hand mirrors the linear temporal progression in virtue of a homomorphism between hand angle and elapsed seconds. This structural mirroring allows a user\u2014whether the owner of a grandfather clock or the neural circuitry controlling diurnal body temperature\u2014to extract temporal facts by reading off clock states.\n\nNotice how this differs from a thermometer. Where the thermometer relies on a single equilibrium state whose value encodes temperature, most clocks rely on dynamical structure: a trajectory of states over which the system moves. Representing time requires representing ordered differences, not merely static magnitudes. Thus the clock mechanism uses its own passage through state-space as the representation. That is why no \u201ctime particle\u201d need bang on it; instead, the system\u2019s evolution is itself the vehicle.\n\n5. Biological time-keeping and the status of a \u201csense\u201d\n\nThe complaint, \u201cbut internal oscillators are not a sense,\u201d gains traction from a folk picture in which senses must be exteroceptive. Yet cognitive neuroscience now recognizes genuine sensory modalities that primarily or exclusively monitor internal states: proprioception, nociception, vestibular balance, baroreception. The vestibular system, for example, detects angular acceleration via fluid inertia in the semicircular canals\u2014fluid set in motion by head movement, not by an external substance called \u201crotation.\u201d If the vestibular organs count as sense organs even though there is no \u201crotation stuff,\u201d then, mutatis mutandis, temporal pacemakers can qualify.\n\nEmpirically, organisms deploy multiple such pacemakers on distinct time-scales:\n\n\u2022 Millisecond timing for acoustic localization uses phase differences across auditory nerve firing.\n\n\u2022 Interval timing in the seconds-to-minutes range recruits striatal beat-frequency models in which cortical oscillations with staggered phases create a \u201ctemporal pattern\u201d read by downstream neurons.\n\n\u2022 Circadian timing involves the aforementioned SCN loop.\n\nEach system is modulated by environmental cues\u2014light entrainment for circadian rhythm, dopaminergic input for interval timing\u2014analogously to how vestibular signals are calibrated by vision. These relations further support the sensory analogy: clashing sources yield perceptual aftereffects (subjective time dilation under stimulants; \u201cchronostasis\u201d when saccades reset apparent duration) reminiscent of cross-modal illusions in vision and audition.\n\n6. Meeting potential objections\n\nObjection 1: Correlation is cheap; mere covariation does not suffice for representation.\n\nReply: Correct. Dretskean indicators become representational only when appropriately recruited by a consumer system\u2014what Millikan calls the \u201cnormal consumer.\u201d In biological clocks, downstream effectors\u2014hormone release, sleep-wake switches, foraging behavior\u2014are systematically controlled by clock state. Maladjusted clocks (jet lag, constant-light conditions) reveal the teleology: their states continue to change but fail to guide behavior adaptively, just as a broken speedometer\u2019s needle moves without representing speed when disconnected from the consumer (the driver). Thus pacemakers are not accidental correlates; they are entrenched in feedback loops that give them semantic weight.\n\nObjection 2: The mechanism might drift; then states would covary poorly with time. Does representation cease?\n\nReply: Exactly as with vision under fog or a thermometer left in the sun, representational accuracy is graded. Representation persists though it degrades. Indeed, the need for regular re-entrainment (zeitgebers like dawn light) illustrates the sensory nature of the system: it is open to calibration by external inputs, not sealed like an innate code. The \u201cdrift objection\u201d therefore supports, rather than undermines, the claim that timekeeping mechanisms function analogously to other senses.\n\nObjection 3: If time is a dimension of every physical process, any process could serve as a clock; hence clock states fail to provide distinctive information.\n\nReply: From the premise \u201cany process unfolds over time,\u201d it does not follow that any process unfolds in a reliably measurable way. Boiling water, radioactive decay, or human speech exhibit too much variability to act as clocks. What matters is lawful stability: low variance in period, insensitivity to moderate environmental fluctuation, and predictability across cycles. Only a subclass of systems meets these criteria. The fact that many objects can emit photons does not prevent photoreceptors from counting as vision; what matters is specialized selection and fidelity.\n\nObjection 4: Sensing time is conceptually different because it lacks modality-specific qualia; there is no \u201ctime qualia\u201d analogous to color.\n\nReply: The same complaint could be leveled at proprioception or baroreception. The phenomenology of bodily posture is subtle and easily overlooked, yet its absence (as in deafferented patients) is devastating. Subjective duration, while faint relative to brightness, can be experimentally manipulated (oddball stimuli seem to last longer, etc.). The presence or absence of strong phenomenal character is not a reliable guide to the taxonomic status of a sense. Philosopher Bence Nanay has suggested that sensory modalities form a graded cluster concept rather than a set defined by necessary and sufficient conditions; temporal sensing falls into the cluster by sharing the relevant explanatory roles.\n\n7. A deeper look: counterfactual dependence and nomological necessity\n\nOne might press: Why not say that the quartz oscillator merely embodies laws of physics, and those laws, not time, do the causal work? But representation does not require the represented magnitude to be a causal antecedent; it requires counterfactual dependence. If the duration between noon and one o\u2019clock were slightly longer, the oscillator\u2019s state\u2014given unchanged physics\u2014would differ. Quartz periodicity is fixed as \u201cone second\u201d only because of how the actual world\u2019s temporal metric is stitched into physical laws. Thus the clock\u2019s operation counterfactually depends on the temporal structure of the world, satisfying Woodward\u2019s criteria for causal explanation.\n\nThis point carries an instructive moral: representation often piggybacks on deeper laws. A barometer need not be shoved by \u201catmospheric pressure particles\u201d; Boyle\u2019s law plus mercury\u2019s density suffice. Similarly, a quartz crystal is not acted on by \u201ctime atoms\u201d; Hooke\u2019s law in the time domain plus the rigidity of silicon dioxide create a reliable correlation. For representation, nomological necessity undergirds informational dependence.\n\n8. Consequences for philosophy of perception\n\nAccepting that organisms possess genuine time-sensing mechanisms forces a reconsideration of familiar dichotomies:\n\n\u2022 External vs internal: The time sense blurs boundaries because it is driven by endogenous oscillators calibrated by exogenous cues.\n\n\u2022 Analogue vs digital: Biological timekeeping employs both continuously evolving processes (oscillatory phases) and digital-like counting (spike accumulation), illustrating the hybridity of sensory coding.\n\n\u2022 Perception vs cognition: Interval judgments as short as 200 ms are modulated by attention and expectation, yet they originate in sub-cortical oscillators. Thus time-perception straddles levels in ways that challenge sharp splits.\n\nMoreover, temporal representation is arguably a necessary precondition for any sensorimotor activity. Acting in the world without encoding duration or simultaneity would be impossible. If so, the \u201cobjection from causal impotence\u201d would entail that no organism could ever perceive\u2014hardly a defensible conclusion.\n\n9. An illustrative example: echolocating bats\n\nConsider a bat emitting an ultrasonic chirp and waiting for its echo to return. The bat determines target distance by measuring the time between emission and re-entry of the sound. Crucially, the bat\u2019s auditory system does not rely on an external timer; instead, neural oscillations in the inferior colliculus phase-lock to the outgoing pulse and count cycles until the echo arrives. Experimental lesion studies show that disrupting these oscillations impairs distance estimation even though auditory sensation remains intact. The bat thus possesses a dedicated sense of interval independent of the acoustic content per se. Nothing in the environment \u201ccauses\u201d the passage of time between chirp and echo; the bat\u2019s intrinsic neural dynamics do the tracking. If that is not sensory time-perception, nothing is.\n\n10. Synthesis: what licenses calling it a \u201csense of time\u201d?\n\nA minimal functional characterization runs as follows:\n\nSense X is a system that (i) transduces energy into neural signals, (ii) whose output covaries lawfully with a distal magnitude M, (iii) which is used by the organism to guide behavior related to M.\n\nTemporal pacemakers in the brain satisfy (i) because metabolic energy drives the oscillations; they satisfy (ii) because oscillator phase corresponds lawfully to elapsed time; and they satisfy (iii) because motor planning, hormonal cycles, and learning windows depend on that phase. The lack of a dedicated \u201ctime particle\u201d is irrelevant, just as the lack of a \u201cleftness particle\u201d does not undermine spatial perception.\n\n11. Closing remarks\n\nThe causal impotence objection dissolves once we notice that representation rides on reliable covariation, not on the represented property\u2019s performing a Newtonian push. Clocks\u2014artificial or biological\u2014achieve temporal representation by enlisting physical processes whose evolution is nomically yoked to temporal intervals. Their informational legitimacy is secured by their integration into feedback loops that exploit that lawlike mapping to steer action. In this respect, temporal sensing resembles more familiar modalities, though it has distinctive features: its vehicles are endogenous oscillations, its mapping is dynamical rather than static, and its phenomenology is diffuse. None of those differences, however, impugns its status as genuine perception.\n\nThus, philosophers who deny a sense of time on grounds of causal impotence mistake a contingent fact\u2014that time is not a force\u2014for a principled bar to representation. Once the distinction between direct causal action and law-grounded covariation is in view, the path is open: a mechanism can faithfully tell the time without time\u2019s ever having to knock on its door.", "output_tokens": 4450, "reasoning_tokens": 1024}

I shall argue that it does not.  The objection trades on an overly literal interpretation of what it takes for a system to carry information about some environmental magnitude.  No perceptual system\u2014whether retinal, cochlear, or internal clock\u2014needs to be knocked about by the very property it represents.  What matters is that the system participate in reliable causal regularities that vary as the represented magnitude varies.  A clock, whether mechanical, electronic, or neural, can therefore inform an organism about temporal intervals even though \u201ctime\u201d never impinges on the device the way photons strike the eye.  I proceed in four steps.  \n\n(1) I distinguish causal impact from representational dependence and clarify what informational coupling really involves.  \n(2) I show, by analogy with familiar measuring instruments, how a system can track an abstract dimension without that dimension\u2019s directly producing a force.  \n(3) I develop a positive model of clock-like timing mechanisms\u2014in machines and in brains\u2014that satisfies the informational requirements of perception while respecting the metaphysical fact that time has no mechanical bumping power.  \n(4) I reply to three objections: the \u201cmere correlation\u201d worry, the \u201cself-contained oscillator\u201d worry, and the \u201cphenomenology\u201d worry.  \n\nThe result is a coherent picture on which a genuine sensory faculty for time is not only intelligible but almost certainly instantiated in many organisms, ourselves included.\n\n1. Causal impact vs. representational dependence  \nA quick concession: sensory systems require causal interaction with the world.  Retinas, cochleae, and olfactory epithelia do not operate in informational isolation.  But from this unobjectionable premise one must not leap to the stronger thesis that the very property represented acts as the distinctive causal initiator.  Two distinctions are worth pressing.\n\na. Token events vs. represented properties  \nA single token event (photons hitting rods) can carry information about a higher-level property (e.g., the surface reflectance of a lemon) without that higher-level property itself causing the retinal excitation.  Surface reflectance is a dispositional trait; it manifests in the pattern of light only in the presence of illumination.  Likewise, velocity is represented by the visual system, yet no \u201cvelocity force\u201d bombards the receptors.  What causally stimulates the eye are successive positions of an object across time.  The visual system nevertheless registers the property of motion because of law-like correlations between those successive positions and the object\u2019s velocity.  \n\nb. Primary vs. derivative causal links  \nOnce we broaden our focus from single links to whole causal chains, representation often turns on derivative rather than primary causal relations.  A newspaper thermometer \u201ctracks\u201d economic inflation if an editor instructs reporters to paste the current CPI figure on it every morning.  The reds and blues on the page are causally linked to printers\u2019 ink, not directly to prices.  Yet the thermometer carries authentic economic information because of a stable, historically designed regularity.  In Dretskean terms, what matters is that there be a reliable dependence that the system is poised to exploit, not that the dependence arises from a single, unmediated causal shove by the represented magnitude itself.\n\nThese two distinctions jointly undermine the premise that because time exerts no primitive force, it cannot be sensed.  What is required is only that there exist physical processes that unfold in ways lawfully dependent on the temporal variable, such that a biological or artifact system can latch onto those processes.\n\n2. Measuring abstract dimensions: length, temperature, number\u2026time  \nAnalogies help.  Consider length.  A wooden ruler does not enjoy the benevolent push of the meter property.  Instead, spatial relations between the ruler\u2019s markings and the object under inspection are exploited to yield information.  To be sure, molecules in the ruler and in the object come into contact, but it is hardly the abstract property of \u201cbeing 10 cm long\u201d that presses itself into the wood.  Similarly, a mercury thermometer measures mean molecular kinetic energy (temperature) via expansion: kinetic agitation of glass and mercury causes volumetric change, but expansion is not driven by some sui generis temperature force.  What is crucial is a law-like monotonic relation between volume and average kinetic energy.  \n\nTime, too, is an abstract dimension.  What we call \u201ca second\u201d or \u201can hour\u201d is individuated by a certain number of occurrences of a chosen periodic process: today, cesium-133\u2019s 9,192,631,770 hyperfine transitions; yesterday, the swing of a pendulum at sea level; before that, the Solar day.  The link between countable physical cycles and duration is established by convention, engineering practice, and natural law.  Nowhere in this linkage does \u201ctime\u201d push anything.  Instead, stable physical processes provide us with markers whose evolution covaries with elapsed time according to principles of mechanics, electromagnetism, or quantum physics.  A clock thus carries temporal information without temporal causation.\n\n3. A positive model: the oscillator-comparator architecture  \nArtificial clocks.  In a quartz wristwatch, electrical energy excites a piezoelectric crystal that vibrates at roughly 32,768 Hz.  An electronic circuit counts these oscillations; upon reaching 32,768, it flips a second-register, drives motor steps, and so on.  The quartz crystal is not acted upon by \u201ctime.\u201d  It vibrates by virtue of its elastic restoring forces and the conservation laws governing its mass and charge distribution.  Yet because the period of vibration is highly stable across temperature ranges and crystal aging, the tick counts provide a reliable stand-in for elapsed seconds.  The watch converts frequency (cycles per second) into a duration code (seconds per hour) by exploiting law-governed regularities, not by sensing a mysterious temporal ether.  \n\nBiological clocks.  Neurobiologists find an analogous scheme in circadian and interval timing.  In Drosophila and mammals alike, transcription-translation feedback loops (TTFLs) generate roughly 24-h oscillations in protein concentrations.  Specialized \u201cclock genes\u201d inhibit their own transcription with a delay, producing rhythmic peaks and troughs.  Downstream pathways\u2014neural firing patterns in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), hormone secretion rhythms, body-temperature cycles\u2014serve as read-outs.  No hypothesized \u201ctime particles\u201d bombard SCN neurons.  Nevertheless, those neurons\u2019 changes in firing rate lawfully covary with objective astronomical time because the TTFL oscillations maintain a near-constant period, entrained by ambient light.  \n\nGeneral architecture.  Both artificial and biological time-senses can be modeled by three components:\n\nOscillator: any physical process with a repeatable, approximately constant period (quartz vibration, thalamocortical spindle, genetic feedback loop, or chemical relaxations).  \n\nCounter/Integrator: a mechanism to accumulate cycles or integrate oscillator phase, thereby generating a monotonic mapping onto elapsed interval length.  \n\nComparator/Effector: a decision device that uses the accumulator\u2019s state to guide behavior\u2014display digits, trigger expectancy of food, or initiate a saccade.  \n\nThis architecture meets the informational desiderata: (i) causal interaction\u2014oscillator dynamics cause counter states; (ii) nomic reliability\u2014periodic dynamics are governed by known laws; and (iii) accessibility\u2014organisms can exploit the accumulator\u2019s state for action.  Crucially, none of the three stages requires a direct force from \u201ctime.\u201d  The causal story is entirely local and mechanistic.\n\n4. Replies to objections  \n\n4.1 The \u201cmere correlation\u201d worry  \nObjection: If temporal representation is grounded only in correlation, then the system lacks warrant to treat its internal states as about time rather than about the oscillator\u2019s phase.  A stopped watch still goes through micro-vibrations; those won\u2019t track real time.  \n\nReply: Correct.  Representation is always fallible.  A retinal photoreceptor that is bleached carries no color information.  What secures content is not instantaneous correlation but historically selected, statistically reliable mapping.  Teleosemantics or etiological theories handle this elegantly: the oscillator-comparator system was selected or engineered precisely because, in normal conditions, its states correlate with elapsed interval.  When placed in abnormal environments\u2014e.g., under strong magnetic fields that slow quartz vibrations\u2014the device misrepresents.  Fallibility is not a defeater of content; it is an inevitable consequence of indirect representation.  The same point applies to every other modality.\n\n4.2 The \u201cself-contained oscillator\u201d worry  \nObjection: Brain clocks are endogenous.  If the oscillator sits inside the agent, how can it constitute a sensory channel as opposed to pure computation?  Sensory systems draw in something from outside; an intrinsic oscillator seems like internal noise.  \n\nReply: The retina, too, is partly endogenous\u2014its phototransduction cascade relies on vitamin A stored in the pigment epithelium.  What makes a system sensory is not its physical location but its informational role: delivering world-directed, action-guiding states.  Circadian oscillators do so because their phase is entrained by external light-dark cycles via melanopsin ganglion cells.  Ultradian and interval timers can likewise be calibrated by exteroceptive cues (sounds, motor reafference, social signals).  Endogenous dynamics merely supply gain and stability; they do not undercut the system\u2019s function as a bridge between environment and action.\n\n4.3 The phenomenology worry  \nObjection: Even granting that clocks carry temporal information, sensory awareness of time has a distinctive flow or duration quality.  Oscillators seem too mechanical to account for the felt passage of time.  \n\nReply: Phenomenology raises deeper questions, but here the causal impotence of time is irrelevant.  The objection conflates (i) representing temporal interval objectively and (ii) generating the subjective \u201cpassage\u201d phenomenology.  One can coherently hold that internal oscillations provide the quantitative metric, while network-level integration and attention shape temporal qualia.  Representation is a necessary component of experience, but the phenomenology depends on additional neural dynamics, much as color experience depends on cortical opponent processing beyond cone excitation.  Thus, the informational story is a prerequisite and remains untouched.\n\nConclusion  \nThe objection that time cannot be sensed because it lacks causal oomph mistakes how representation works.  Clocks\u2014biological and artifact\u2014measure time by embedding themselves in law-governed causal chains that covary with elapsed intervals.  They receive no blows from \u201ctime\u201d itself, but neither do rulers from \u201clength\u201d or thermometers from \u201ctemperature.\u201d  What matters are reliable, exploitable regularities, which abound in oscillatory physical processes.  Consequently, a genuine sensory system for time is not only metaphysically possible but empirically instantiated.  Denying its existence would require an implausibly restrictive view of what perception demands\u2014a view inconsistent with our best understanding of measurement, representation, and neurobiology.", "output_tokens": 2756, "reasoning_tokens": 448}

Introduction and Thesis  \nThe \u201ccausal-impotence\u201d objection goes roughly as follows: we have genuine senses of light, sound, and pressure because photons, sound waves, and mechanical forces causally impinge upon dedicated receptors. Time, by contrast, is not a force or field; it does not bump into retinas or press on cochleae. Therefore there can be no bona-fide sense of time, and any device (biological or artefactual) that seems to \u201ctrack\u201d time must be doing something else\u2014at best monitoring metabolic change, light\u2013dark cycles, or some other genuinely causal signal.  \n\nI shall argue that the objection rests on two mistakes. First, it assumes that information about a property or magnitude must arrive via that property\u2019s exerting a direct, isolatable causal influence. But many familiar sensory and measurement systems acquire information through mediated or structural correlations with features that never themselves \u201cstrike\u201d the receptor. Second, it trades on an ambiguous picture of what time is: if time is not a worldly feature in addition to events but the relational dimension in which all physical change is embedded, then the demand that time act as an independent causal factor is misplaced. Once these confusions are cleared away, it becomes clear how a clock can carry information about time: not by being kicked by \u201ctime particles\u201d but by instantiating a lawful, reliably periodic process whose successive states stand in a law-governed mapping to temporal intervals. A nervous system can exploit the same strategy\u2014e.g. via circadian oscillators or short-period neuronal pacemakers\u2014to ground a rudimentary sense of duration or simultaneity. Causal contact with time is unnecessary; lawful covariation, properly recruited, suffices.\n\n2. The Objection Analysed  \nSensory systems, the objector notes, have a characteristic architecture:  \n(1) There is an environmental variable E (light intensity, air pressure, sugar concentration) that matters to the organism.  \n(2) E causally affects a receptor R dedicated to that range of stimuli.  \n(3) Through a chain of transduction and neural processing, information about E reaches decision and motor centres.  \n\nTime appears to violate step (2). While events occur in time, nothing called \u201ctime\u201d strikes R; so either step (1) is misdescribed (there is no such variable) or R is idle. Hence, no temporal sense.\n\nThis line of thought is initially compelling, but it equivocates on two distinct claims:\n\nC1. Information that originates in X can reach an organism only if X causally interacts with the organism.\n\nC2. A system can represent X only if X causally interacts with the system in a way the system is specially designed to exploit.\n\nI grant C1; you cannot discover the colour of a distant nebula without causal traffic from nebula to you. C2, however, is false. Representation can be based on reliable intermediaries. A barometer represents atmospheric pressure, not because \u201cpressure particles\u201d press directly on its dial (they do not) but because changes in pressure causally influence air density, which influences the mercury column. The mercury\u2019s height is about pressure in virtue of a law-governed chain that preserves a strict mapping. The proximate cause is mercury expansion; the represented magnitude is air pressure.\n\nAn exactly parallel story can be told for clocks. What directly causes the displacement of the quartz crystal or the motion of the pendulum is electromagnetic interaction or gravity; nonetheless the readings are about time because the underlying dynamics are lawfully periodic in a way that establishes a stable correlation with elapsed durations. Hence C2 is too restrictive. Once we admit representation via lawful covariation, the alleged gulf between time and its \u201csenses\u201d evaporates.\n\n3. What Would Count as a Sense of Time?  \nBefore defending the positive proposal, we need a minimal functional criterion: an organism S possesses a sensory system for magnitude M just in case\n\n(Functional Adequacy) States of S systematically covary with values of M in a way that (i) is produced by stable internal mechanisms, (ii) can misrepresent M, and (iii) is exploited to guide behaviour adaptively sensitive to M.\n\nThis criterion is neutral on whether M\u2019s values impinge directly on the receptor. It emphasises function: to sense temperature, a snake\u2019s pit organ need not be touched by heat per se; it merely has to evolve a mechanism whose states reliably track temperature and serve control. If that is right, a temporal sense is possible in principle: an internal pacemaker whose cumulative phase difference tracks external durations and modulates behaviour (e.g. foraging or predator avoidance) would qualify.\n\n4. Time, Change, and Causation  \nA second thread in the objection is metaphysical: time, it is claimed, does no causal work at all. Events are causes; time is just the background. So how could tracking time provide novel information? The answer lies in distinguishing two roles of \u201ctime\u201d:\n\n(Physical Time) A relational parameter t in the fundamental laws, ordering events and spacing them by intervals measured by standard processes.\n\n(Manifest Time) The phenomenological or ecological feature that matters to agents: how much \u201clater\u201d one event is than another, constraints on simultaneity, rates of change.\n\nFor creatures embedded in the world, what matters is manifest time: knowing whether dawn is three hours away or whether a looming object will collide in 0.5 seconds. The covariance exploited by clocks\u2014pendula, atomic oscillations, neuro-oscillators\u2014links the unfolding of some local physical process to parametric time in the laws. Therefore, although time qua dimension causes nothing, lawful correlations between parametric time and the phase of an oscillator allow the oscillator to serve as an informational surrogate. To reject this would also force us to deny that a thermometer gives information about temperature (temperature is not a particular causal agent but a statistical property of molecular motion), or that a galvanometer measures voltage (no \u201cvoltage particle\u201d exists). The objection thus overgeneralises.\n\n5. How Clocks Carry Temporal Information  \nConsider a simple pendulum clock.\n\n5.1 The Physical Story  \nA pendulum of length L, under gravity g, exhibits small-angle oscillations with period T = 2\u03c0\u221a(L/g). The positions of the pendulum bob at successive moments are governed by Newtonian dynamics with no explicit time-dependant forcing. Yet if we record the number of completed swings N since a reference moment t0, we can reconstruct elapsed time \u0394t \u2248 N\u00b7T. Crucially:\n\n(a) The pendulum is endogenously periodic: its state space trajectory returns to near the same point every T seconds.  \n(b) The law linking N to \u0394t is stable across a wide range of conditions (to first order).  \n(c) The counting mechanism\u2014an escapement advancing gears\u2014transforms these cycles into a representational medium (dial position).\n\n5.2 The Informational Story  \nOn a broadly Dretskean picture, a physical event E carries information about proposition P when the conditional probability of P given E is high because of a law-like dependence. Each additional tick raises the probability that one minute has passed by a factor determined by the reliability of the mechanism. Nothing in this account requires time itself to do causal work; it suffices that (i) physical laws fix a one-to-one mapping between time parameter t and oscillator phase \u03c6, and (ii) the mechanism is designed (by selection or engineering) so that downstream consumers read \u03c6 as a cue to \u0394t.\n\n5.3 Semantic Uptake  \nSuppose the gears drive a bell that chimes each hour. The bell\u2019s striking is causally triggered by gear alignment; semantically, the strike signifies: \u201can integer hour has elapsed.\u201d That content is underwritten by the history of design (the clockmaker intended hours to be signalled) or in the biological case by natural selection. Again, direct causal contact between \u201ctime itself\u201d and the striker is not needed.\n\n6. Biological Parallels: Circadian and Interval Timing  \nNature is full of temporal sensors:\n\na. Circadian clocks: Suprachiasmatic-nucleus neurons express transcriptional\u2013translational feedback loops with near-24-hour periods. Light inputs entrain the oscillator, but after entrainment the clock free-runs. If you place an organism in constant darkness, gene-expression cycles continue, and behaviour (sleep, hormone release) follows. The internal state misleads if the organism is transported across time zones\u2014jet-lag is temporal misrepresentation.\n\nb. Interval timing: Cerebellar and striatal circuits implement millisecond-to-second timers via ramping firing rates or population clocks. Experiments show animals can be conditioned to expect a reward one second after a tone; lesions disrupt this expectation without impairing other senses, indicating specialised temporal circuitry.\n\nIn each case, causal interactions with metabolic or photic cues fine-tune the oscillator, but the core timing signal is generated intrinsically. The brain uses the oscillator states as surrogates for external time. The causal work is done by molecular reactions; the representational target is duration.\n\n7. Objections and Replies  \nObjection 1: Correlation is not representation. Why say the pendulum position represents time rather than just bob displacement?\n\nReply: Representation depends on function. A barometer tube also correlates with mercury temperature, but we say it represents air pressure because the device was built to track pressure and because downstream consumers treat the reading as information about pressure. Similarly, the clock was built so that dial positions guide time-keeping actions (meeting, prayer, factory whistles). In biological contexts, evolutionary success calibrates which correlations matter. Teleology, not bare covariance, grounds semantic content.\n\nObjection 2: Without a genuine receptor for time, we lack sensory phenomenology of time. Clocks may measure duration, but organisms do not feel it.\n\nReply: The argument conflates sensory input channels with conscious phenomenology. Many genuine senses operate below awareness (blood-oxygen chemoreceptors, vestibular otoliths). Experiments on \u201ctemporal adaptation\u201d show that humans can experience altered duration perception (e.g., after prolonged exposure to rapid flicker, subsequent events seem longer). Such after-effects suggest dedicated neural pathways analogous to orientation-selective cells in vision. The presence of adaptation and illusion fulfils a standard mark of sense modality.\n\nObjection 3: If tracking time depends on periodic change, the system really senses change, not time.\n\nReply: Change and time are conceptually intertwined. Yet the crucial feature is that lawful periodic change provides a metric for temporal intervals independent of specific events measured. The pendulum\u2019s cycles do not represent swings; they represent seconds. What makes them seconds rather than swings is their role as a standard unit parasitic on the invariance of T. Likewise, a yardstick is a stick, but we say it represents length, not cellulose. Representation supervenes on use.\n\nObjection 4: General relativistic effects (gravitational time dilation) break the uniform mapping between oscillator phase and time; hence clocks can mislead. Does that not undercut the informational link?\n\nReply: Fallibility is a virtue of representation: only things that can mis-represent count as representations. Pendulum clocks fail on a ship; quartz watches drift with temperature; atomic clocks require relativity corrections. These breakdowns show that the system really purports to represent physical time, otherwise we would not call the discrepancies errors.\n\n8. Distinctions Clarified  \nThe debate is clouded by several conflations; let me draw three distinctions.\n\nD1: Direct vs. mediated causation. Direct impingement is a special case of mediated causal chains. Sensing via proxy is ubiquitous.\n\nD2: Physical vs. semantic information. Physical information is covariance; semantic information requires functional use. The causal-impotence objection targets the wrong level.\n\nD3: Ontic vs. epistemic roles of time. Physics treats time as a dimension; organisms treat time as a variable to estimate. The second role can be filled by tracking periodic processes.\n\n9. Dialectical Up-shot: From Sensory Limitation to Design Opportunity  \nBy reframing the issue around covariance and function, we dissolve the claim that a temporal sense is impossible. Indeed, the objection yields a research program: identify the internal oscillators, their noise characteristics, and how neural architectures read out and correct them. Computational neuroscience now models \u201ccentral pattern generators\u201d and \u201cpopulation clocks\u201d that subserve rhythmic motion and duration judgement. Far from exposing a conceptual impossibility, the causal-impotence challenge highlights where empirical investigation should look: to the design of internal dynamics rather than to mythical time particles.\n\n10. Conclusion  \nA clock\u2014or a circadian pacemaker\u2014carries information about time without time\u2019s exerting causal force. It does so because (i) physical law tightly correlates oscillator phase with parametric time, and (ii) the system is functionally organised so that those correlations guide behaviour. The causal-impotence objection thus misfires. Time need not \u201chit\u201d a receptor; stable lawful structure suffices for sensing. This moral generalises: whenever a magnitude lacks a proprietary force, organisms and engineers can nonetheless achieve representation via internally generated processes whose unfolding mirrors the magnitude\u2019s order and metric. Rejecting such representation would force us to abandon not just the sense of time, but thermometers, voltmeters, and barometers too. An adequate theory of perception must make room for information delivered by structure as well as by impact\u2014a lesson we already rely on each time we glance at a clock.", "output_tokens": 3523, "reasoning_tokens": 640}

Setting the Problem\n\nMany philosophers and neuroscientists speak loosely of a \u201csense of time.\u201d  Critics charge that this talk is metaphysically confused.  Standard sensory modalities rely on causal impingement from an external feature onto a sensory receptor: light on the retina for vision, pressure on the skin for touch, molecules on olfactory cilia for smell.  Time, however, does not buffet our nervous system the way photons buffet photoreceptors.  Time\u2014so the objection goes\u2014is not a causally efficacious substance or field; it is a dimension, a parameter in the laws.  Since nothing literally \u201cemanates\u201d from time and strikes our receptors, there cannot be a bona fide time sense.  Similarly, a physical clock seems puzzling: if time has no causal powers, how can a mechanism reliably encode temporal information?  Must we conclude that talk of \u201csensing\u201d or \u201cmeasuring\u201d time is metaphorical at best?\n\nI shall argue that the objection rests on an overly narrow conception of how a system can carry information.  A mechanism can lawfully covary with some worldly magnitude even when that magnitude exerts no independent causal force.  What matters is that (a) the mechanism\u2019s internal dynamics unfold according to laws that make its state a reliable function of the magnitude to be represented, and (b) the system can be calibrated so that users (biological or artifactual) can exploit that reliable covariance.  Once this broader notion of information\u2010carrying is in view, both biological \u201ctime sensing\u201d and mechanical timekeeping present no mystery.  A quartz crystal or a neural pacemaker does not need to be shoved by time; it needs only to instantiate dynamical regularities whose evolution, when counted or read off, is correlated with elapsed temporal interval.  The work is done by lawful self-propagation, not by an external \u201cinflux\u201d of temporal stuff.\n\nThe argument proceeds in five steps.  Section 2 clarifies two rival pictures of sensory representation.  Section 3 sketches an information-theoretic account on which lawful covariance\u2014rather than direct causal impingement from a proprietary stimulus\u2014is sufficient for representation.  Section 4 applies the account to paradigmatic clock mechanisms from pendulums to atomic transitions; Section 5 turns to neurobiological timing.  Section 6 replies to three lingering worries, and Section 7 concludes.\n\n2. Two Pictures of Sensory Representation\n\nCall the first picture the Impingement Model:\n\n     (I) A sense modality requires a dedicated receptor that is selectively excited by a proprietary stimulus energy.  \n     (II) The presence of that energy at the receptor is the proximate physical cause of sensory signals.\n\nOn the Impingement Model, what it is to be a genuine stimulus for a sense just is to be the kind of thing that impinges causally on the receptor surface.  Vision owes its existence to the fact that photons deliver energy to retinal photopigments.  Hearing exists because acoustic pressure waves jostle the basilar membrane.  \n\nFrom (I) and (II) a quick objection seems to follow: time is not the sort of thing that can impinge; therefore there is no time sense.\n\nYet philosophers of perception have long recognized a second, broader picture, call it the Lawful Covariance Model:\n\n     (LC) A receptor variable R can represent environmental variable E provided there is a counterfactual-supporting lawlike dependency such that, across normal conditions, the value of R is correlated with (and explained by) the value of E, in a way that can be exploited by downstream systems.\n\nUnder (LC) the sun\u2019s position represents time of day to a sundial, even though the sun does not impinge on the gnomon with a proprietary \u201ctime particle.\u201d  What impinges is light; but what is represented, via lawful functional dependence, is the hour.  More precisely, there is a stable mapping f between solar elevation and clock time under ordinary terrestrial conditions; the sundial exploits f to make hour\u2010indicating shadows.\n\nNotice that LC does not deny causal influence; the dial\u2019s shadow is caused by light.  But causal impingement need not come from the represented magnitude itself.  Likewise we routinely say that a mercury thermometer \u201crepresents temperature\u201d: the causal influence is pressure on the glass\u2010mercury system, yet what is tracked is kinetic energy per molecule.  The thermometer\u2019s reading depends lawfully on temperature, even though the latter is not a distinct causal stuff.\n\nThe opponent might reply that thermometers still rely on causal energy transfer.  True; but the transfer is not from temperature per se.  Nor does the thermometer possess a special receptor for temperature; it merely has constituents whose expansion lawfully covaries with molecular agitation.  The crucial lesson is that tracking can be mediated: a system can represent X via causal mediation by Y, so long as there is a suitable law linking Y\u2019s states to X\u2019s values.\n\n3. Information Without Direct Impingement\n\nWe can make this precise using Dretskean informational semantics.  Signal S carries information about condition C when, given background laws L,  \n\n      P(C | S) = 1.  \n\nThat is, under L, S would not occur unless C occurs.  To know that the signal S has obtained is ipso facto to know C.  C may, but need not, be the immediate cause of S; it suffices that S lawfully covaries with C.  \n\nShannon\u2019s quantification of information is likewise correlation-based, not impact-based.  Mutual information I(S;C) is high when observing S reduces uncertainty about C.  Whether C ever physically touches the channel through which S travels is irrelevant.\n\nTherefore, the notion that \u201csenses must be caused by what they sense\u201d is too strong.  They must be caused by something that is suitably related by law to what is sensed\u2014a weaker and far more general requirement.  Photons lawfully covary with external reflectance features, so retinal excitation informs us about macroscopic shapes.  Light is merely the mediator.\n\nOnce we adopt the lawful-covariance view, the puzzle about time evaporates: a mechanism can represent temporal intervals if its states stand in a reliable mapping to those intervals, regardless of whether time causally \u201cpushes\u201d those states.  All that matters is that each temporal interval be associated (under normal conditions) with a distinctive, readable state of the mechanism.\n\n4. How Physical Clocks Work\n\n(a) Pendulum Clocks  \nA pendulum of length l oscillates with period T = 2\u03c0\u221a(l/g).  Neglecting air resistance and temperature drift, the pendulum\u2019s own prior displacement plus gravitational force suffices to determine its next displacement.  Time plays no causal role beyond entering the second-order differential equations as a parameter.  Yet the pendulum\u2019s state at t\u2080 + nT (namely, \u201chas crossed the mean position n times\u201d) is nomically linked to the amount of elapsed time nT.  By counting the swings, an escapement gear converts that lawful regularity into dial motion.  Anyone who sees the minute hand, therefore, gains information about elapsed time, not because time forces the hand into place, but because the hand\u2019s angle is functionally constrained by the pendular dynamics that lawfully unfold at a fixed rate relative to inertial time.  \n\n(b) Quartz Oscillators  \nIn a quartz watch, an electric circuit drives a crystal cut so that it mechanically resonates at 32,768 Hz.  Elapsed time is represented by counting cycles of electrical vibration.  Again, it is the feedback loop between piezoelectric deformation and the circuit that causes the next oscillation; time does no work.  Why trust the watch?  Because under quantum-grounded physical laws, the resonant frequency of quartz is extraordinarily stable across ordinary ranges of temperature and acceleration.  Stability grounds counterfactual dependence: had 10 seconds not elapsed, the counter in the CMOS register would not yet have received 327,680 pulses.\n\n(c) Atomic Clocks  \nThe same story unfolds at higher precision.  Cesium-133 atoms possess a hyperfine transition whose frequency is fixed by natural constants.  Microwave radiation is locked in phase with that transition; a servo loop adjusts cavity frequency until maxima in absorption indicate resonance.  The atom\u2019s internal dynamics\u2014stemming from quantum electrodynamics\u2014are the causal drivers; but they evolve in a way we treat as temporally invariant.  Hence we use the count of oscillations (9,192,631,770 for one SI second) as an index of time, and indeed define the second that way.  Causation runs from atomic constitution to detector clicks, not from a metaphysical \u201cflow of time,\u201d yet the correlation is robust enough to ground temporal representation.\n\n(d) Error, Drift, and Calibration  \nThese examples also show why time representation need not be perfect.  Friction shortens a pendulum\u2019s effective length; voltage drift alters quartz period.  Such errors reveal that the mechanism\u2019s reliability, not some mysterious causal power of time, underwrites successful timekeeping.  Calibration\u2014comparing one oscillator with another taken as standard\u2014is our way of ensuring the necessary lawful linkage.  If two watches diverge, the poorer is corrected or discarded; no metaphysical crisis ensues.\n\n5. Biological \u201cClocks\u201d\n\nHuman and animal brains contain multiple timing systems:\n\n(i) Circadian oscillators (the suprachiasmatic nucleus) implement roughly 24-hour gene-protein feedback loops.  Light resets the phase each day, but once entrained the loop free-runs in constant darkness.  Time of day is internally represented by the concentration profile of certain proteins; the mapping holds by biological law, not because time beams its hours into our neurons.\n\n(ii) Seconds-to-minutes interval timing appears to rely on cortical-striatal circuits in which ensembles of neurons show ramping or oscillatory firing.  In \u201cpacemaker-accumulator\u201d models, a quasi-Poisson pacemaker emits pulses that are collected until a threshold representing the criterion interval is reached.  Pulse generation is caused by intrinsic membrane dynamics; time does not strike the brain like hail.  Yet organismal behavior (pressing a lever after 12 s for reward) indicates that pulse count covaries with objective duration.\n\n(iii) Millisecond timing for speech and music probably exploits oscillatory interference patterns in auditory cortex and cerebellum.  Again, lawful dependencies between phase relationships and real time allow perception of rhythm and syncopation.\n\nIn each case the nervous system uses internal change\u2014oscillation, drift, ramping\u2014to stand in for elapsed time.  Exteroceptive calibration (sunlight, social schedules, metronomes) refines accuracy, but the basal mechanisms need no external causal influx from time itself.\n\n6. Replies to Three Worries\n\nWorry 1. \u201cBut these devices only measure change, not time.  Counting oscillations is just tracking one process\u2019s internal state.  Calling the result \u2018time\u2019 is conventional.\u201d\n\nReply:  All measurement involves mapping an unknown to a known.  A mercury column measures temperature by tracking its own expansion; a voltmeter measures potential difference by tracking coil deflection.  What licenses the description \u201cmeasurement of X\u201d is not metaphysical directness but reliable, law-grounded correlation plus agreed calibration.  Oscillation counts are therefore perfectly legitimate temporal measurement.  The fact that the mapping is conventional (we could have defined the second as 18,385,263,540 oscillations) does not undermine the reality of what is measured; conventions merely fix units, not the magnitude itself.\n\nWorry 2. \u201cEven if clocks measure physical time, a \u2018sense\u2019 requires sensory transduction of an external magnitude.  Biological timing is endogenous, so it is not perception but cognition.\u201d\n\nReply:  The boundary between perception and cognition is porous.  Proprioception and vestibular balance rely on internal receptors (muscle spindles, semicircular canals) driven by self-motion, not by external objects.  We rightly treat them as senses because they deliver non\u2010inferential, phenomenologically immediate information usable for action.  Interval timing shows the same profile: we can feel a rhythm speed up or a movie\u2019s frame rate stutter without inference.  What qualifies a system as sensory, on contemporary embodied views, is its role in guiding perception\u2013action loops, not the exteroceptive origin of its signals.\n\nWorry 3. \u201cIf time has no causal efficacy, how can there even be laws that state t-dependence?  Surely equations like d\u03b8/dt = \u221a(g/l) presuppose something about temporal becoming.\u201d\n\nReply:  The objection conflates metaphysical accounts of time (A\u2010theory, B-theory, presentism, eternalism) with causal power.  Whatever one\u2019s stance on becoming, the differential equations remain empirically confirmed.  They describe how system states at one parameter value (t) entail states at another (t + dt).  Nothing additional needs to push systems along the parameter; determinism plus initial conditions suffice.  Saying \u201ctime does no causal work\u201d is not to deny that physical evolution is temporally indexed; it is simply to reject the reification of time as an agent.  Clocks exploit the indexed regularities, not a mysterious flow.\n\n7. Conclusion\n\nThe challenge to a genuine time sense stems from an overly restrictive template for sensory representation\u2014a template that demands proprietary causal impingement from the represented magnitude.  Once we adopt the more general lawful-covariance conception, the mystery dissolves.  A quartz watch, a pendulum clock, or a cortical timing circuit does not wait for time to knock on its door; it only needs internal dynamics that unfold at a stable rate.  Those dynamics, when appropriately calibrated and read, lawfully encode elapsed temporal interval.  Biological creatures evolved to exploit such internal clocks, integrating them with exteroceptive cues in complex ways that support circadian regulation, motor coordination, and conscious temporal experience.  \n\nTherefore, the absence of a distinctive \u201ctemporal particle\u201d is no bar to sensing time.  Information can ride on causal processes whose relation to the represented magnitude is indirect yet lawful.  Clocks tell time not because time causally tells them what hour it is, but because they reliably tell us where, in the invariant dynamical structure of the world, we currently stand.  That is all representation requires.", "output_tokens": 3663, "reasoning_tokens": 640}

A pendulum clock, a suprachiasmatic nucleus in the mammalian brain, or an oscillating quartz crystal carries information about elapsed time because its state tokens stand in stable, law-grounded correlations with temporal magnitudes.

What must a sensory system do?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTalk of a \u201csense of X\u201d can mean at least three different things.\n\nSense1:    A transducer that is selectively sensitive to a magnitude, transforming it into neural signals.  \nSense2:    A representational system that keeps track of a magnitude well enough to guide action.  \nSense3:    A phenomenological modality\u2014there is \u201cwhat it\u2019s like\u201d to experience X.\n\nThe objection under consideration targets Sense1: If no causal influence of time reaches a transducer, there is nothing to register.  The critic tacitly assumes a *Contact Principle*: for a system to carry information about M, M itself must strike the system.  But that principle is false both philosophically (on any information-theoretic account) and empirically (many instruments work via correlations rather than direct contacts with the measured property).\n\nNotice also that the critic jumps from \u201ctime exerts no force\u201d to \u201cno system can use time-related information.\u201d  This overlooks the pervasive fact that *time is a parameter in the equations governing every causal process*.  The pendulum bob does not feel a separate temporal shove, yet its motion is *indexed* by the temporal parameter because Newton\u2019s second law contains derivatives with respect to t.  That is enough for information-bearing.\n\nA more defensible principle, I suggest, is:\n\nInformational Covariation Principle (ICP):  \nA state S of mechanism C carries information about magnitude M if, in virtue of general physical laws and boundary conditions, P(S at t | M = m) \u2248 1 and P(S at t | M \u2260 m) \u2248 0 within the relevant calibration range.\n\nICP makes no mention of M\u2019s delivering a causal \u201ckick\u201d directly to C.  What matters is the nomic reliability of the correlation.  This is Dretske\u2019s idea in *Knowledge and the Flow of Information* dressed in Bayes\u2019 clothing; one can also connect it to Shannon\u2019s mutual information.\n\nIf ICP is right, the critic\u2019s premise (1) is wrong; causal covariation is enough, direct causal mediation by the property as such is unnecessary.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nII.  How a clock keeps time\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTake the paradigmatic artefact-clock: a simple pendulum.\n\nDynamics.  For small amplitudes \u03b8, the period T \u2248 2\u03c0\u221a(L/g).  This result is derived from *F* = m\u00b7a and the small-angle approximation of the sinusoidal restoring torque.  Neither the derivation nor the resulting motion invokes a force of time.  Nevertheless, *the number of oscillations completed* by the pendulum in an interval covaries one-to-one with the duration of that interval because the equations governing the system are time-translation invariant.\n\nCalibration.  To turn a lawful covariation into a *measurement*, we calibrate.  Choose an arbitrary conventional unit\u2014say, \u201cthe duration of 86,400 such periods shall equal a day.\u201d  The markings on the clock face encode that mapping.  The clock does not *need* to know what days are; it need only maintain the invariant oscillatory dynamics.  \n\nInformation flow.  Let S\u2099 = \u201cthe escapement wheel has advanced n teeth.\u201d  By construction, P(S\u2099 | elapsed time = n\u00b7T/teeth) \u2248 1 to a high degree of precision (modulo thermal drift, friction, etc.).  S\u2099 therefore carries the information \u201cn seconds have passed.\u201d  The causal chain runs: gravitational field + rigid rod length + initial amplitude \u2192 oscillatory motion \u2192 escapement advancement.  Time doesn\u2019t enter as a free cause; it is the parameter with respect to which the entire causal story is *described*.  That is enough.\n\nNo mystical residue remains.  Time appears *implicitly* as the independent variable of the dynamical law.  Because the law is stable, the mechanism\u2019s state trajectory can stand in for elapsed time.  In short: a clock is a *law-rigged correlator*.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nIII.  Temperature: a diagnostic analogy\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe critic might grant the pendulum story but complain that we have only replaced one puzzle with another: isn\u2019t the notion of \u201cstanding in lawlike covariation\u201d itself suspect when the measured magnitude does no causal work?\n\nConsider thermometers.  Temperature, on statistical-mechanical accounts, is a macroproperty defined as mean molecular kinetic energy.  Molecules in the mercury bulb collide with glass molecules, transferring kinetic energy, causing volume expansion.  But \u201ctemperature\u201d itself\u2014*the mean*\u2014never strikes the mercury.  Yet nobody doubts that thermometers measure temperature.\n\nThe thermometer case shows:\n\n1.  Indirect detection via lower-level causal processes is common and unproblematic.  \n2.  The property measured need not be an independent causal entity; it can be a higher-level abstraction realised in the very same causal goings-on.  \n\nTime is analogous.  It is not a force; it\u2019s a structural parameter built into every causal evolution.  Mechanisms that exploit invariant dynamics to produce reliably changing states can therefore carry information about time in exactly the way thermometers carry information about temperature.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nIV.  Biological timekeeping\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSceptics sometimes shift ground: \u201cPendulum clocks are artefacts calibrated by us; living organisms had no engineer to do the calibration.  So how could evolution deliver a genuine time sense?\u201d\n\nThe answer is: the same lawful invariances exploited by clockmakers furnish raw material for natural selection.  Two examples:\n\n1.  Circadian oscillators.  The cyanobacterial KaiABC protein loop exhibits a roughly 24-hour phosphorylation rhythm even in vitro.  Differential growth rates among mutant strains show that strains whose oscillation period better matches the environmental light-dark cycle outcompete others.  Natural selection ratchets the oscillator\u2019s period towards 24 hours.  The proteins are \u201ccalibrated\u201d by differential reproductive success, not by a watchmaker.\n\n2.  Neural pacemaker-accumulator systems.  In vertebrates, dopaminergic neurons in the basal ganglia fire at quasi-regular rates.  Psychophysical experiments (peak-interval procedures, temporal bisection tasks) reveal scalar timing: the standard deviation of time estimates grows linearly with mean duration.  This is predicted by a simple tick-counter model (pacemaker emitting pulses stored in an accumulator, read out by reference memory).  Dopamine manipulations that speed or slow the pacemaker rate predictably contract or dilate subjective duration.  Again, no force of time is detected; rather, stable neural oscillations correlate with elapsed time, and behaviour exploits that correlation.\n\nSo biological \u201csenses of time\u201d rest on exactly the same explanatory schema as artefact clocks: lawful regularities + calibration (via selection or learning) \u2192 informative states.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nV.  Four residual objections\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nObjection 1.  \u201cIf time exerts no causal force, calling the clock\u2019s state \u2018informative about time\u2019 is merely conventional.  We could equally say it tracks *oscillations*.\u201d  \n\nReply.  Conventions settle which variable we map to which physical state, but the *nomic structure* supporting high mutual information is objective.  We could indeed re-describe the clock as a counter of pendulum bobs, yet because the period is stable, the state also reliably indicates elapsed seconds.  That double-description is typical: a barometer \u201ccounts\u201d mercury column heights *and thereby* barometric pressure.  Objective informativeness does not reduce to human convention, though our interests select which correlation we exploit.\n\nObjection 2.  \u201cRelativity teaches that time is frame-dependent, so any single oscillator can\u2019t tell \u2018what time it really is\u2019.\u201d  \n\nReply.  True, but irrelevant.  Clocks measure proper time along their world-lines.  Two world-lines with relative velocity will record different intervals between shared events.  That fact vindicates, rather than undermines, the present account: each clock\u2019s internal dynamics track the invariant integral \u222b\u221a(1\u2212v\u00b2/c\u00b2) dt along that path.  What the objection shows is that no single device gives *God\u2019s time*, not that no device carries temporal information.\n\nObjection 3.  \u201cIllusions of duration (e.g., oddball stimuli seem longer) show that our time sense is too malleable; therefore it cannot be a bona fide sense.\u201d  \n\nReply.  Every sensory system is susceptible to context-driven illusions (consider color constancy failures, Muller-Lyer lines).  Illusions demonstrate *processing*, not absence of a sensory modality.  Moreover, the very possibility of systematic misestimation presupposes a representational standard that can be deviated from.  A blank slate cannot err.\n\nObjection 4.  \u201cEven granting lawful covariation, why isn\u2019t temporal tracking just an internal monitor, not a *sensory* system?  Vision and audition are exteroceptive; timing mechanisms seem endogenous.\u201d  \n\nReply.  The exteroceptive/interoceptive divide is a red herring.  Proprioception senses limb position via muscle spindles\u2014an internal signal\u2014yet is rightly called a sensory system.  What matters is informational function.  Organisms need to coordinate with rhythms in the environment (day/night, predator approach, speech flow).  Internal oscillators provide access to a dimension\u2014temporal location\u2014crucial for successful action.  They are therefore perfectly analogous to other senses in their teleofunctional role.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nConclusion\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe no-sense-of-time objection dissolves once we replace the \u201cforce\u201d model of perception with an information-theoretic model.  Time is not a causal agent, but its metric structure constrains every physical process.  Mechanisms\u2014artefactual or biological\u2014that embody stable dynamics thereby come to carry reliable information about elapsed time.  Calibration (by design, selection, or learning) harnesses those correlations for action guidance.  Thus a clock *can* keep time, and animals *can* sense time, without needing a causal shove from Father Time himself.  The objection mistakes absence of a mysterious \u201cchronon flow\u201d for absence of information; in reality, information piggybacks on lawful covariations, and those are everywhere.", "output_tokens": 3396, "reasoning_tokens": 832}

Introduction and Thesis\n\nA venerable line of skepticism insists that there can be no \u201csense of time.\u201d Sensory systems, the thought goes, work by causal impingement: light waves strike the retina, pressure deforms the skin, odorant molecules bind to olfactory receptors. Time, by contrast, is routinely characterized as \u201ccausally impotent.\u201d It is not a force or substance that can buffet a receptor. Hence (the objection concludes) time cannot be sensed, and mechanisms such as biological clocks do not literally carry temporal information.  \n\nI shall argue that the objection mis-conceives both the nature of sensing and the way in which information is carried. Once we keep track of the distinction between (a) something\u2019s being a *causal source* of a sensory stimulus and (b) its being a *law-governed correlate* that a system can exploit, we see that time can be represented without exerting causal force. A clock\u2014biological or artificial\u2014stores information about temporal relations in virtue of internal causal processes whose behavior is systematically dependent on the parameter t. What matters for representation is not that time *pushes* the mechanism, but that the mechanism\u2019s states vary with time in a stable, counterfactually robust way that a consumer system can use. In short: causal covariation suffices; causal *origin* is not required.\n\nAfter clarifying the causal requirement implicit in the objection (\u00a72), I show (\u00a73\u20134) how a physical process whose dynamics are governed by laws with an explicit time-parameter naturally comes to carry temporal information. I then illustrate with pendulum clocks, radioactive decay, and endogenous circadian oscillators (\u00a75). Section 6 addresses three residual worries: (i) calibration, (ii) the \u201cmere change\u201d objection, and (iii) the alleged difference between perception and inference. I conclude (\u00a77) by situating the proposal within contemporary theories of representation.\n\n2. What Do Senses Really Require? Relaxing the Causal Source Condition\n\nThe objection trades on an intuitive but overly strong principle:\n\n(Causal Source Condition, CSC)  \nA system S perceptually represents property P only if P causally produces, or partially constitutes, the proximal stimulations that drive S.\n\nCSC is plausible for paradigmatic exteroception: the *light* is the proximal cause of retinal excitation; the *pressure* wave from a sound makes the eardrum vibrate. But two preliminary points already chip away at CSC\u2019s universality.\n\nFirst, even in vision, the distal property that interests us\u2014say, the *shape* of an object\u2014is **not** itself the causal source of retinal activity. What shapes the retina is a pattern of reflectance; \u201cshape\u201d enters the causal chain only by law-governed correlation. CSC therefore over-states what standard senses require.\n\nSecond, biology teems with *endogenous* sensing. Vertebrate vestibular organs sense head rotation partly by monitoring inertia of internal fluids; the fluid\u2019s movement is generated by the subject\u2019s own motion, not by an external medium. Proprioception similarly samples muscle spindles that the organism itself stretches. In such cases there is causal stimulation, but it is not imposed by an independent environmental source. The property represented (joint angle, head acceleration) is *constituted* by the organism\u2019s relation to its own previous states. Again, causal origination by P is absent.\n\nThese cases suggest replacing CSC with a weaker principle:\n\n(Relational Covariance Condition, RCC)  \nA system S perceptually represents property P if changes in P are reliably correlated, by natural law, with changes in some internal variable V such that S is functionally organized to use V as a guide to P.\n\nRCC still insists on causal traction\u2014there must be a dependable causal pathway\u2014but it does not demand that P be the immediate causal *source*. Lawlike covariance and functional exploitation suffice. The question is whether clocks satisfy RCC for time. I now show that they do.\n\n3. Dynamics, Parameters, and the Time Variable\n\nPhysics describes systems by state variables x(t) whose evolution is governed by ordinary differential equations like dx/dt = f(x). Here, t appears as an *independent parameter*\u2014the axis along which change is plotted. Time does not enter as a force term; nevertheless, if you know the law and the current state, you can read time off the system\u2019s subsequent states. A trivial example is uniform motion: x(t) = x0 + vt. From the distance traveled you can calculate the elapsed time \u2206t = (x \u2013 x0)/v.\n\nThe general pattern is this:\n\n1. There is an internal variable V whose value is given by a law V(t).  \n2. V changes monotonically over ordinary temporal intervals (monotonicity prevents ambiguity).  \n3. The mapping from V to t is stable under a range of perturbations.  \n\nWhenever 1\u20133 are satisfied, reading V is tantamount to reading t. That is precisely how a clock, broadly construed, works.\n\nCrucially, nothing in 1\u20133 requires that *time itself causes the change in V*. Rather, V\u2019s evolution is a manifestation of a causal mechanism (pendulum dynamics, radioactive decay, gene-regulation feedback loops) whose *law* explicitly involves t. The representation relation piggy-backs on lawful covariation rather than on t\u2019s supposed causal potency.\n\n4. A Generic Model of Clock Information\n\nLet us formalize the foregoing intuition. Suppose a mechanism M has an internal state space \u03a3 and a read-out function R: \u03a3 \u2192 \u211d. Call R(\u03c3) the *display variable*. We add three properties:\n\n(i) Law of Motion: For initial state \u03c30 at t0, the evolution \u03c3(t) obeys \u03c3(t) = \u03a6t(\u03c30). \u03a6t is a deterministic flow indexed by t.  \n(ii) Rate Condition: R(\u03a6t(\u03c30)) = kt + c for constants k, c.  \n(iii) Consumer Link: Some downstream system C relies on the value r = R(\u03c3) to guide behavior that is adaptively successful only if r correctly tracks t.\n\nGiven (i)\u2013(iii), Shannon-style mutual information between R and t is maximized (subject to noise); on a teleosemantic reading, R *represents* t because it is recruited by selection for that very purpose. Note that t never impinges on M as a cause; what drives the change is the mechanism\u2019s own internal dynamics plus energy supplied by gravity, spring tension, metabolic reactions, etc. Still, RCC is satisfied: variations in t covary with R in a way M and C exploit.\n\n5. Concrete Cases\n\n5.1 Pendulum Clocks  \nThe period of a simple pendulum of length L in a uniform gravitational field is T = 2\u03c0\u221a(L/g). Gravity and mass distribution set the *rate*, but once constructed the device counts atoms of time via successive swings. Each swing advances the escapement wheel by one tooth; the wheel\u2019s rotation angle \u03b1(t) is piecewise linear in t. Reading \u03b1 is reading elapsed seconds. Time does not *press* the pendulum; gravitational potential energy and inertial motion do the work. Yet \u03b1 carries temporal information because \u03b1(t) has a stable harmonic relation to t modulated only by small perturbations (temperature, air resistance)\u2014hence the historical quest to isolate the pendulum from such noise sources.\n\n5.2 Atomic Clocks  \nA cesium-133 atom switches between hyperfine energy levels at a frequency f = 9,192,631,770 Hz. An electronic circuit counts the oscillations. The causal origin of the transitions is quantum electrodynamics, not \u201ctime,\u201d but because the frequency is remarkably constant, the count N is proportional to t, allowing the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures to define one second as *exactly* 9,192,631,770 cycles. Atomic clocks illustrate how improving the stability of the law (ii) above refines temporal resolution without invoking temporal causation.\n\n5.3 Circadian Oscillators  \nMany organisms possess gene-regulatory feedback loops (e.g., the PERIOD\u2013TIM complex in Drosophila) with an intrinsic 24-hour limit cycle. The phase variable \u03c6 of the molecular oscillator entrains to day-night cues but persists under constant conditions (free-running rhythms). Neural circuits read \u03c6 to modulate metabolism, hormone release, and sleep. In mammals, lesions to the suprachiasmatic nucleus abolish \u03c6 and produce arrhythmic behavior, demonstrating consumer dependence (iii). Again, no \u201ctime rays\u201d strike the neurons; information arises from the oscillator\u2019s consistent phase advance with respect to t.\n\n6. Replying to Three Objections\n\n6.1 Calibration Worries  \nOne might concede that internal dynamics can track time *in principle* but worry that, absent external temporal cues, drift would soon destroy accuracy. True, mechanism M must be *calibrated*. But calibration does not undermine representational status. Vision relies on ocular growth, lens accommodation, and neural plasticity to keep images in focus; proprioception recalibrates via efference copy. Clocks are no different: entrainment to the light-dark cycle, temperature compensation, or periodic synchronization to a radio time signal refine k in R(\u03a6t). Calibration is a ubiquitous feature of sensing, not a mark against temporal representation.\n\n6.2 The \u201cMere Change\u201d Objection  \nPerhaps what clocks register is not time per se but *change* in some physical magnitude. A pendulum measures angular displacement, the cesium clock counts energy state transitions, the circadian oscillator tracks protein concentration. While true descriptively, the objection conflates *vehicle* with *content*. To see why, recall that retinal cones register glutamate release rates, yet we say they represent color. Vehicle/content separation is forced by the consumer relation: what matters downstream is not the pendulum\u2019s angle but the answer to \u201chow much time has elapsed?\u201d If changing angle ceased to correlate with time\u2014say, on a spacecraft with variable g\u2014the same angular readings would no longer guide successful temporal predictions. Teleosemantic theories make representation dependent on *proper function*; the proper function here is tracking time, not angular displacement.\n\n6.3 Perception versus Inference  \nA final worry insists that because the organism must *compute* time from endogenous change, the phenomenon is cognitive inference, not sensory perception. The line between perception and inference, however, is porous. Color constancy requires complex neural computation; yet we call color a perceptual attribute. Similarly, vestibular perception of rotation subtracts efference-copy from semicircular-canal signals. Many psychologists classify interval timing (milliseconds to hours) as a form of \u201cinternal sense\u201d because its error profile (scalar variability, adaptation aftereffects) mirrors that of canonical senses. Rejecting its sensory status on the ground of internal processing would overshoot and threaten to declassify much of perception.\n\n7. Situating the Account: Information, Structure, and Representation\n\nSeveral contemporary accounts of representation endorse exactly the sort of covariation-plus-use relation exploited above.\n\n1. Dretskean Informational Semantics: A variable R carries information about t if the probability distribution P(t | R) differs from the prior P(t). Monotonic functions of t maximize this information.  \n2. Teleosemantics (Millikan, Neander, Papineau): R represents t when natural selection has recruited R because it *indicates* t, and consuming systems use it accordingly. Biological clocks fit the bill handsomely.  \n3. Structural Representation (Cummins, Ramsey, G\u0142adziejewski): An internal model M structurally maps onto features of the target domain. The phase space trajectory of an oscillator is homomorphic to the linear time-axis; the mapping preserves temporal order, enabling prediction.\n\nIn all three cases, causal *origin* in t is unnecessary. What matters is reliable correspondence and functional exploitation. That is why the initial objection conflated two distinct roles played by causality: (a) transmitting energy that perturbs a receptor, and (b) underwriting nomic correlations on which a system relies. Time fails at (a) but succeeds at (b). Hence the objection does not go through.\n\n8. Conclusion\n\nWe began with a challenge: if time cannot causally impinge on a mechanism, how could any system \u201csense\u201d it? The answer is that sensing is not limited to direct causal bombardment by the represented property. A clock, whether hanging in a train station or ticking in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, harnesses an internal process whose evolution law includes time as a parameter. Because that law is stable, monotonic, and exploitable by a consumer system, the mechanism\u2019s state variables encode elapsed time. This satisfies a relaxed but principled account of what sensory representation requires.\n\nRecognizing this point unifies exteroceptive and interoceptive phenomena under a common informational framework, while freeing us from reifying time as an occult causal agent. The sense of time is real, not because time pushes on us, but because organisms have evolved ingenious ways of letting the river of change leave a mark in organized matter\u2014marks we, and they, can read.", "output_tokens": 3504, "reasoning_tokens": 704}
{"question_id": "Viera-SenseTime-2020", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_with_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 13, "is_human": false, "grader_model": "openai/o3", "scores": {"thesis_clarity": 5, "argumentative_soundness": 5, "dialectical_engagement": 6, "precision_distinctions": 6, "substantive_contribution": 5, "example_quality": 6, "total": 33}, "error": null, "answer": "How can an organism, or a machine, be said to \u201csense\u201d time if time itself never reaches out and pushes on anything?  The objection rests on a familiar causal-transduction picture of the senses: photons strike retinas, pressure waves strike cochleae, chemical molecules bind to olfactory receptors.  Because time is not the sort of entity that exerts forces, the thought goes, there can be no sense dedicated to time.  In what follows I argue that the objection conflates two very different ways in which a feature of the world might underwrite representation.  A feature can be (i) a direct causal source of signals in the transducer, or (ii) a law-governed parameter that systematically modulates other states of affairs which, in turn, do exert causal influence.  Temporal magnitude falls into the second category.  The upshot is that a clock\u2014whether a pendulum in a cathedral or a circadian pacemaker in a suprachiasmatic nucleus\u2014can carry actionable information about time even though time itself never \u201chits\u201d the device.  Sensing time requires only that there be (a) an internal process whose evolution is monotonically related to elapsed duration and (b) an information-picking relation between that process and action-guiding systems.  Once we see that, the causal-impotence objection loses its grip.\n\n1.  Two Routes to Representation\n\nThe first step is to separate causal interaction from information content.  Call the immediate impinging cause of a transducer\u2019s state a \u201cprimary signal.\u201d  In normal daylight vision, the primary signal is photon absorption in photopigments.  But consider vision at night.  Because photon flux is low, the visual system relies heavily on temporal integration: rods accumulate charge over \u223c100 ms before generating a neural spike.  Crucially, what the spikes represent (spatial layout and reflectance) is not identical to what impinges on the receptor (electromagnetic quanta); there is a many-to-one inference from input to distal cause.  So even paradigmatic senses involve a gap between causal source and represented property.  That gap is bridged by lawful regularities linking the impinging energy to the environmental property of interest.  The same strategy applies to temporality, only in a purer form: the represented property is a *parameter* that structures the lawful evolution of physical processes rather than an energetic source in its own right.\n\n2.  Time as a Parameter in Dynamical Laws\n\nPhysics treats time as an independent variable in differential equations: x(t + \u0394t) = f(x(t), \u0394t).  Although time does not exert a Newtonian force, it is not inert from an informational point of view.  Given any sufficiently regular system\u2014radioactive decay, crystal oscillator, migrating interneuron bursts\u2014there is a lawful mapping between elapsed duration and the state of the system.  If an organism has access to the current state, and knows the law (whether innately or through calibration), it can infer how much time has passed.  The lawful mapping plays the same epistemic role as the optics equations that link wavelength distributions to surface properties.  That role is enough to ground representation even in the absence of direct causal contact with time itself.\n\n3.  Clocks and the Information-Carrying Relation\n\nWhat, then, is a clock?  Nominally: a physical mechanism whose state S(t) instantiates a monotone, invertible function of elapsed time.  A pendulum\u2019s angular displacement, a caesium atom\u2019s hyperfine oscillation, or a thalamic network\u2019s spiking rhythm each satisfy that condition.  The second ingredient is a *read-out* mechanism: an observer (human, animal, or robot) that couples to S(t) and maps it onto action.  For instance, bees use oscillatory levels of PER protein as a phase indicator to decide when to leave the hive.  Notice that what interacts causally with the read-out is not time but the *surrogate variable* S.  The surrogate is causally efficacious; it vibrates, decays, or changes concentration, and thus triggers downstream activity.  Yet by virtue of lawful correlation, S carries Shannon information about t.\n\n4.  Addressing the Causal-Impotence Worry\n\nThe critic may concede that clocks correlate with time but protest that a mere correlation is insufficient for genuine sensory representation.  After all, barometer readings correlate with impending storms; yet no one says the barometer *senses* storms.  The missing ingredient, however, is *appropriate use.*  A clock is hooked up to behavioral controllers in a way that enables on-line temporal regulation: circadian gene expression schedules metabolic cycles, cerebellar Purkinje cells fine-tune motor commands in milliseconds, bats adjust emission rates of echolocation pulses in microseconds.  The barometer, by contrast, sits on the wall and is ignored.  One can formulate the point in Ruth Millikan\u2019s teleosemantic terms: the proper function of the pacemaker is to provide the organism with time estimates; the proper function of the barometer is not to guide anyone\u2019s actions.  Proper function completes the step from correlation to representation.\n\n5.  \u201cPhotons Hit Retinas\u201d and Other Red Herrings\n\nStill, the critic might insist: in vision the distal cause and the energetic signal are token-identical (photons), whereas in time-keeping the distal cause (elapsed duration) is a parameter, so the analogy fails.  But the comparison is weaker than it appears.  When colors are perceived, the relevant distal cause is *spectral reflectance,* not photons.  Reflectance is a dispositional property, realized across indefinitely many photon-events; yet we do not deny that color vision is a sense.  Similarly, pitch perception represents the frequency of a sound source, not the pressure waves themselves.  Frequency is an abstract parameter, again realized in but not identical to its energetic substrate.  So the ontology of the represented property\u2014dispositional, statistical, or parametric\u2014poses no barrier to sensory status.\n\n6.  Objection from Multiple Realizability\n\nSuppose the critic reformulates the worry: because any physical process unfolds in time, *any* change in S is correlated with elapsed duration.  So the correlation between a clock variable and time is trivial; hence reading S provides no non-accidental information.  Response: what matters is not mere covariation but *law-grounded, counterfactually robust* correlation.  If the pendulum were shorter, its period would change in a lawful way; if ambient temperature altered the quartz crystal, the oscillator would speed up.  These counterfactual patterns are precisely what is exploited when we calibrate a clock or when neural learning rules adjust synaptic weights to track reliable temporal regularities.  By contrast, accidental correlations do not support such cross-world stability.  That is why the angle of my cat\u2019s tail, though temporally extended, is useless as a chronometer.\n\n7.  Is a Temporal Sense Redundant?\n\nOne line of criticism suggests that, given extramental clocks in the environment (the sun\u2019s position, tidal cycles), organisms need no internal time sense.  Yet ethological evidence shows otherwise.  Desert ants *Cataglyphis* integrate outbound stride counts to compute homing vectors even when the sky is occluded; songbirds rehearse nocturnal migratory routes using endogenous circannual rhythms; humans deprived of zeitgebers still display free-running circadian periods.  These behaviors require sensitivity to time intervals in the absence of external synchronizers.  External clocks supplement but do not replace internal timing mechanisms.\n\n8.  The Metaphysics of Temporal Qualia\n\nA more phenomenological version of the objection targets consciousness: even if clocks exist in the nervous system, why should their activity manifest as a *sense* that time is passing?  Here the reply mirrors the broader representational argument.  Just as activation in V4 gives rise to red-experience because of its role in tracking spectral features, activation in timing circuits (e.g., striato-cortical loops) gives rise to duration experience because of its role in estimating elapsed time.  No additional \u201cchronokinetic force\u201d must impinge on consciousness.  The sense of time emerges from the brain\u2019s use of temporal proxies, not from brute causal contact with time.\n\n9.  A Constructive Model: Oscillatory Timestamping\n\nTo make the proposal concrete, consider an \u201coscillatory timestamp\u201d model.  (i)  A central pattern generator emits rhythmic bursts at frequency f.  (ii)  Downstream neurons integrate spike counts; the integral n approximates elapsed time t = n/f.  (iii)  Whenever a sensory event occurs (say, the onset of a tone), its neural representation is tagged with the current n in working memory.  (iv)  Decision circuits compute \u0394t by subtracting the stored n from the current counter.  Throughout, time is never a causal factor; what does the causal work are spike trains.  Yet the system gains actionable duration information.  Experimental data on hippocampal \u201ctime cells\u201d and striatal beat-frequency models line up well with this abstract architecture.\n\n10.  Extending the Account: Relational Senses and Ersatz Proxies\n\nFinally, note that the clock-as-proxy strategy generalizes.  We lack receptors for mass, yet we perceive weight via pressure exerted on muscles and tendons.  We lack receptors for numerical quantity, yet we subitize small numerosities via parallel individuation circuits.  In each case, the system leverages a causal surrogate (pressure pattern, cortical accumulator) whose evolution is lawfully tied to the target property.  Time is simply an extreme case in which the surrogate must track a dimension rather than a localized stimulus.  Once we accept surrogate-based sensing as legitimate\u2014and biological cognition abounds with it\u2014the special pleading that bars time drops away.\n\n11.  Summing Up the Argument\n\n(A)  Sensing requires a causal transducer, but the transducer need only be affected by *something* that lawfully covaries with the target property.  \n(B)  Physical processes evolve according to laws with time as a parameter, so their states provide lawful surrogates.  \n(C)  If an organism hooks action to those states in a teleologically appropriate way, the states represent elapsed time.  \nTherefore, a genuine time sense is metaphysically coherent even though time itself is causally impotent.\n\n12.  Closing Reflection: From Objection to Opportunity\n\nSeen in this light, the causal-impotence objection is not merely answerable; it illuminates a deep point about epistemology.  Much of what we know\u2014causal power, probability, moral value\u2014is not delivered by single dedicated receptors but inferred from patterns in more basic sensory inputs.  Temporal magnitude belongs to this \u201chigher-order\u201d class.  Our success in tracking it testifies to the brain\u2019s capacity to leverage lawful structure rather than to wait passively for nature to slap it with the relevant property.  Once the objection is defused, the remaining task is empirical: chart the surrogate variables, map their neural read-outs, and explain how their interaction yields the rich phenomenology of time.  Philosophy\u2019s role is to clear the conceptual ground; biology and cognitive science can then get on with filling in the details.", "output_tokens": 2876, "reasoning_tokens": 448}

Introduction and Thesis  \nMost philosophers accept a \u201ccausal contact\u201d requirement on genuine perception: a sensory system carries information about a feature F only if that feature exerts\u2014or is mediated by\u2014causal influence on the system. Time, however, is often said to be \u201ccausally impotent\u201d: nothing is pushed, pulled, or impinged upon by time itself.  Hence (the objection runs) there can be no sense of time.  Human time\u2010experiences, and clock mechanisms more generally, must therefore be either inferential constructs or purely conventional; they cannot be perceptual in anything like the way vision, audition, and the other canonical senses are.  \n\nI shall argue that the objection rests on a mistaken picture of how information reaches a sensory system.  What a system needs is not direct causal action by the *abstract property* it represents; it needs reliable causal *covariance* between some detectable state of affairs and that property.  Because physical processes necessarily unfold in law-governed ways, many internal and external processes covary with elapsed temporal interval.  By harnessing one of those regularities, a mechanism\u2014biological or artefactual\u2014can be a perfectly respectable time-sensor.  The pendulum clock, the oscillating quartz crystal, and (arguably) the human cortico-striatal beat-frequency network all exemplify this strategy.  Time, while not itself a causal agent, is trackable because every causal process leaves temporally structured traces.  \n\nIn short:  \n\nThesis\u2003A sensory or measuring system can legitimately represent time provided (i) some state of the system covaries lawfully with temporal magnitude, and (ii) that covariance is appropriately exploited for control or inference.  Direct causal action from \u201ctime itself\u201d is unnecessary, because lawful covariance suffices for information-carrying.  Once the causal-contact principle is recast in this more perspicuous way, the purported impossibility of time perception dissolves.\n\n2. Unpacking the Causal Contact Principle (CCP)  \nThe objection relies on a strong reading of CCP:  \n(CCP-Strong)\u2003For S to perceptually represent F, F must *cause* S\u2019s representational state.  \n\nIn ordinary cases this looks plausible: photons hitting photoreceptors, airborne molecules binding to olfactory cilia, mechanical deformation of hair cells in the cochlea.  But even here, what does the causing is not \u201ccolor\u201d or \u201csmell\u201d in the abstract; rather, concrete micro-physical events that reliably *correlate* with those higher-level properties.  Redness is not a force; photons of certain wavelengths are.  Warmth is not a molecule; faster molecular motion is.  If CCP-Strong disqualified time-sensing, parity of reasoning would disqualify color- and temperature-sensing as well.  The realist about vision does not insist that \u201credness reaches out and touches the retina\u201d; she insists that world-states whose possession of the property \u201cred\u201d is lawfully linked to patterns in the retina.  \n\nThat observation suggests a weaker, and more defensible, formulation:  \n(CCP-Covariance)\u2003For S to perceptually represent F, there must be a causal chain from some state of affairs G to S\u2019s receptors such that (i) G covaries with F under the relevant background laws, and (ii) S is sensitive to G in virtue of that very covariance.  \n\nTemperature is perceived because molecular agitation (G) causally affects thermoreceptors, and there is a lawlike covariance between average kinetic energy and temperature (F).  Crucially, the average kinetic energy *grounds* temperature, but grounding is not itself a causal relation; what *causes* the sensor to fire are still the molecular impacts.  Nothing violates CCP-Covariance.  \n\n3. Time and Causal Impotence  \nGranting CCP-Covariance, why think time is special?  Two reasons are often given.  \n\n(1) Time is ubiquitous.  Because every physical process unfolds in time, nothing can vary with time in the way molecular impact varies with temperature; temporal passage is merely the background medium.  \n(2) Time\u2019s features\u2014earlier, later, t-seconds elapsed\u2014cannot be localized; thus no \u201ctemporal particles\u201d can impact a receptor.  \n\nBoth points are accurate but innocuous once we keep separate:  \n\u2022 being a direct causal influence,  \n\u2022 standing in a lawful co-variation relation.  \n\nEvery causal process unfolds over time; precisely *for that reason* many processes are suitable proxies for temporal magnitude.  Pendulum displacement, radioactive decay counts, cellular circadian oscillations, and cortical beta-band phase drift each instantiate a reliably monotonic or periodic function of elapsed time.  That is enough to satisfy CCP-Covariance.  No temporal particles required.  \n\n4. How Clocks Carry Information Without Time as Cause  \nConsider a classical pendulum clock.  What enters into causal commerce with the escapement mechanism is the *position* of the pendulum bob, which in turn depends on gravitational torque, length, and energy dissipation.  Under small-angle and constant-g assumptions, the period T \u2248 2\u03c0\u221a(L/g) is invariant.  Thus the nth swing token-correlates with t = nT.  Time does not cause the swing; *earlier states of the pendulum cause later states* under timeless differential equations, and those equations guarantee the requisite covariance.  \n\nFormally:  \nLet S(t) be the pendulum\u2019s state at real time t.  The laws of motion yield S(t + T) = S(t).  Define a readout function R on the gear train that maps states S to numerals.  Because the mapping from S to t is bijective (modulo T), R(S(t)) contains (Shannon) information \u2248 H(t).  The clock\u2019s users exploit that information: they consult the numeral to catch trains or bake cakes.  At no point must \u201ctime\u201d push the gears.  What drives the system is ordinary mechanical causation; what *makes* it a timekeeper is the law-entrained isomorphism between S\u2019s evolution and temporal interval.  \n\nThe same template applies to quartz watches (piezoelectric oscillations), atomic clocks (hyperfine transition frequencies), and biological pacemakers (protein phosphorylation cycles).  In each case:  \ni. A physical substrate has a privileged dynamical invariant (period, decay constant, phase drift).  \nii. Sensory or electronic circuitry picks up that invariant.  \niii. A representational state is generated.  \n\nBecause the covariance is secured nomically, the representation is as robust\u2014and as fallible\u2014as any other sense.  Heat illusions arise when law-auxiliaries (ambient wind, moisture) disrupt the correlation; temporal illusions arise under psychedelics or high adrenaline, which alter neural pacemakers.  None of this threatens the legitimacy of the modality.  \n\n5. Human \u201cTime Sense\u201d  \nSceptics sometimes grant that *devices* can measure time while denying that *organisms* can *perceive* it.  But the dichotomy crumbles on inspection.  Three lines of empirical evidence:\n\nA. Interval Discrimination.  Humans and many animals can reliably distinguish, without counting, auditory or visual events that differ by as little as 20 ms in duration\u2014well below the threshold at which attention shifts or memory cues intervene.  \n\nB. Neural Implementation.  The Striatal Beat Frequency model posits cortical oscillators with slightly different periods whose coincident firing gates striatal neurons.  The coincidence pattern after elapsed interval \u0394t encodes \u0394t.  Dopamine modulates both frequency and coincidence-detection sensitivity, explaining pharmacological distortions of experienced time.  Again, no temporal rays impinge; internal dynamics suffice.  \n\nC. Multimodal Recalibration.  In the \u201ctemporal ventriloquism\u201d paradigm, vision and audition co-adapt so that if a beep leads a flash by 100 ms repeatedly, the system recalibrates perceived simultaneity for unrelated stimuli.  Such plasticity mirrors spatial prism adaptation, the gold standard for sensory modality status.  \n\nObjection: These are *inferences* from memory of earlier states, not perceptions.  \nReply: They bear all the hallmarks of perception: low-level, fast, cognitively impenetrable, and subject to adaptation.  Memory plays no larger role than it does in color constancy (which compares current input with recent illumination statistics).  The distinction between online perceptual processes and offline inferential reconstruction therefore does not map cleanly onto the time-sense case.  \n\n6. Examples that Do Philosophical Work  \nExample 1: The Radioactive Hourglass.  \nImagine an hourglass filled with a known mass of \u00b9\u00b3\u2077Cs.  Each decay event flips a bistable circuit; after N flips, the device strikes a bell.  Because the decay is genuinely random, no earlier state predicts the exact micro-pattern, yet the aggregate conforms to half-life \u03c4.  Lawlike covariance, not micro-determinism, is what matters.  The set of bell rings encodes elapsed multiples of \u03c4 without time causing anything\u2014only the weak force operates.  The example shows that even *stochastic* processes can serve as temporal proxies so long as the statistical law is known.  \n\nExample 2: The Planetless Observer.  \nSuppose a voyager in intergalactic void floats with no external cues\u2014no sunsets, no ticking devices, only her heartbeat.  She straps a plethysmograph to her wrist; each pulse drives an LED, providing temporal \u201cpips.\u201d  If autonomic drugs double her heart rate, the same device now mis-represents: she believes less time has passed than actually has.  The case parallels color illusions under monochromatic lighting.  It confirms that misrepresentation and adaptation are possible, strengthening the claim that heartbeat was genuinely encoding time before the intervention.  \n\n7. Dialectical Engagement  \nCould the sceptic reply that covariance without causal influence by F renders the representation merely *derived*?  In clocks, any local causal chain is *about* mass displacements, electrical potentials, or photon emissions; \u201ctime\u201d enters only from the theorist\u2019s standpoint.  Hence the representation is not *original*, unlike vision where color is *immediately* given.  \n\nThree counter-points.  \nFirst, philosophy of perception increasingly acknowledges that sensory systems encode distal properties only via proximal surrogates\u2014think of color vision carving reflectance from spectral power distributions plus illumination priors.  If that makes color \u201cderived,\u201d so be it; the term then does no disqualifying work.  \n\nSecond, original/derived content is a matter of informational architecture.  A representation is original if the system\u2019s *use* of the state does not need an external interpreter.  Clock gears drive alarm bells that wake sleepers; cortico-striatal coincidence firing drives muscular responses for timed interception; no homuncular interpreter is needed.  \n\nThird, there exist hybrid cases\u2014echolocation, electric fish electro-sense\u2014whose status nobody doubts despite depending on self-generated pulses correlated with environmental structure.  The organism emits the pulses; the environment echoes them; the echoes carry spatial information.  By parity, a brain can emit oscillations, then re-compare them to encode temporal distance.  Self-generated does not mean non-perceptual.  \n\n8. Precision in Distinctions  \nMuch confusion stems from failing to separate:  \n\u2022 Time *as abstract parameter* vs. time *as measured variable* (elapsed interval).  \n\u2022 Direct *impression of passage* vs. *representation of duration*.  \n\u2022 Externally driven sensing (photon influx) vs. internally driven sensing (oscillator phase).  \n\nOnly the second pair\u2014representation of duration via lawful covariance\u2014concerns the status of a time sense.  Whether or not the feeling of \u201cnowness\u201d is perceptual is orthogonal.  Likewise, internal drivers do not demote a modality; proprioception is largely internally generated yet is a paradigm sense.  \n\n9. Substantive Pay-Off: A Research Program  \nIf the above argument succeeds, philosophers and cognitive scientists should treat temporal perception as on a par with other modalities, with corollary methodological shifts:  \n\n\u2022 Just as vision science maps color spaces, we can map *chronometric spaces*\u2014psychophysical functions relating physical duration to perceived duration under sundry physiological states.  \n\n\u2022 Cross-modal interactions (temporal ventriloquism, sensorimotor synchrony) merit study for what they reveal about sensory integration principles more generally.  \n\n\u2022 Disorders of time perception (Parkinson\u2019s disease, ADHD) should be investigated alongside color blindness and amusia, not relegated to abstract \u201ccognitive\u201d impairments.  \n\nThese empirical recommendations flow directly from conceding that temporal representation qualifies as sensory under CCP-Covariance.  \n\n10. Objections Handled  \n\nObjection A: Covariance is not enough; fortune tellers\u2019 card spreads covary with future events by mere accident (if the lucky guess comes true).  \nReply: The requirement is *lawful*, exploitation-attuned covariance, not mere correlation.  Fortune teller correlations are neither reliable nor used by a mechanism evolved or engineered to exploit them.  Clocks and brains rely on dynamical invariants underwritten by physics and honed by selection or design.  \n\nObjection B: If covariance suffices, *everything* represents time because everything changes.  \nReply: Representation is not mere change; it is change *interpreted by the system* to guide behavior or inference.  A rock expands in heat but does not use the expansion.  A clock gear\u2019s angular position drives downstream readouts; a neural coincidence pattern drives motor timing.  Representation demands functional downstream use.  \n\nObjection C: The feeling of temporal flow remains unexplained.  \nReply: True, the metaphysics of passage is distinct from the epistemology of time measurement.  My claim is only about the latter.  Establishing a sensory basis for duration does not settle whether flow or the present moment are objective features.  But even if the dynamicist view of passage is illusory, the sense of duration can still be perceptual, as color remains perceptual even if secondary-quality realists strip it of mind-independent status.  \n\n11. Summary  \n1. CCP-Strong is overly restrictive; the more plausible CCP-Covariance allows representation wherever a property is reliably tracked by causally efficacious surrogates.  \n2. Physical processes supply an abundance of such surrogates for temporal interval.  \n3. Clocks, both artefactual and biological, harness those processes to encode time.  \n4. The objection that time\u2019s causal impotency bars a time sense therefore fails.  \n5. Recognizing temporal perception as genuine opens empirical and philosophical research avenues analogous to those of the other senses.  \n\nTime\u2019s hand never touches the pendulum, the quartz crystal, or the neuronal oscillator, yet they all keep faithful count of its passing.  The moral is not that they cheat; it is that *information without direct causation by the abstract property is the norm, not the exception, in sensory systems*.  Once that lesson is learned, the purported mystery of the time sense evaporates, and we can turn to the more intriguing question of how good the human chronometric apparatus can become.", "output_tokens": 4182, "reasoning_tokens": 896}
