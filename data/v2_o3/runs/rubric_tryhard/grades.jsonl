Stating the thesis  \nIf you learn that out of a countably infinite family of fair, independent coin-flips only finitely many landed heads, your rational credence that your own coin landed heads should drop to 0.  The attractive but mistaken view that it ought to stay at \u00bd rests on a too-simple reading of \u201cstill a fair coin\u201d and on the thought that one cannot condition on probability-zero events.  Once we take proper account of (i) the symmetry of the situation, (ii) the technology of regular conditional probabilities, and (iii) the way global frequency information screens off local fairness, the right update is fixed and it drives the credence to 0.  The road to that conclusion passes through some familiar philosophical minefields\u2014Borel-paradox worries, self-locating uncertainty, and different conceptions of Bayesian learning\u2014but none of them, I will argue, overturn the basic verdict.\n\n2. Why the puzzle arises  \nTwo principles seem to conflict.\n\nFairness: Before any information is supplied, each flip is independent with chance \u00bd of heads.  \nMinimal update: Learning something that does not mention my coin should not affect its chance.  \n\nYet the content of the new information\u2014\u201conly finitely many heads\u201d\u2014intuitively makes heads a scarce resource.  If only, say, seventeen heads were scattered through countably many coins, it would be astronomically unlikely that mine is one of them.  The urge to say \u201cthen my chance must be 0\u201d competes with the urge to say \u201cbut the coin is still fair.\u201d  The tension is sharpened by the fact that the event of finitely many heads has unconditional probability 0 (Kolmogorov\u2019s 0\u20131 law), so ordinary conditional probability P(H | F) is undefined.\n\n3. A quick tour of the mathematics we need  \n3.1  The sample space \u03a9 is {0,1}^\u2135\u2080 with product measure \u03bc = (\u00bd\u03b4\u2081+\u00bd\u03b4\u2080)^\u2135\u2080.  \n3.2  Let F be the set of sequences with only finitely many 1\u2019s.  Then \u03bc(F)=0.  \n3.3  A regular conditional probability (RCP) for the \u03c3-algebra generated by F exists (by standard extensions of Kolmogorov) and is unique \u03bc-a.e.  So it makes sense to ask for a well-defined \u03bc-a.e. value of \u03bc(H\u2080 | F).\n\nRegular conditionalization lets us work with probability-zero conditioners by approximating them with positive-probability cylinders and taking limits.  Where that limit exists and is invariant under \u201creasonable\u201d ways of taking it, there is a principled Bayesian update.\n\n4. The exchangeability route  \nDe Finetti\u2019s theorem: Any infinite exchangeable sequence of {0,1}-valued random variables can be represented as i.i.d. draws conditional on a latent parameter \u0398, the limiting relative frequency of heads.  For the genuine fair-coin measure, \u0398 is almost surely \u00bd.  The event F is the set {\u0398=0}.  Conditionalizing the prior \u03bc on F is therefore equivalent to conditionalizing the degenerate prior on the hypothesis \u0398=0.  Given \u0398=0, the draws are i.i.d. Bernoulli(0).  Hence  \n\u2003\u03bc(H\u2080 | F) = E[ P(H\u2080 | \u0398) | \u0398=0 ] = 0.  \n\nExchangeability guarantees that whatever is true of coin 0 is true of any other; F is a tail event, so knowing it fixes \u0398 but does not tell you anything individuating about position 0.  Any view that retains credence \u00bd must therefore reject the core Bayesian machinery of exchangeable representation, or find a principled reason to refrain from conditioning on a tail event\u2014a hard road, as we will see.\n\n5. The symmetry/cylinder approximation route  \nAnother route avoids de Finetti and uses only permutation symmetry and finite-dimensional cylinders.  Say you first learn F_k,n: \u201cIn the first n coins at most k are heads.\u201d  For fixed k, letting n\u2192\u221e drives the relative frequency of heads among those n coins to 0 with probability one; by exchangeability, the posterior chance of H\u2080 given F_k,n goes to k/n \u2264 k/n.  Taking n\u2192\u221e we get \u03bc(H\u2080 | F_k,n) \u2192 0.  Then let k\u2192\u221e.  The nested sequence of events F_k=\u22c3_n F_k,n increases to F, and the conditional probabilities have already converged to 0, so the regular conditional \u03bc(H\u2080 | F) must be 0.  The limit is unique because the symmetric approximating filtration respects all the automorphisms of the problem; the Borel\u2010paradox fear that different \u201cpaths\u201d of conditioning would yield different answers is blocked by enforcing permutation invariance.\n\n6. Why \u201cit\u2019s still a fair coin\u201d is a red herring  \nWhat sustains the \u00bd intuition is the slogan \u201ca fair coin has \u00bd chance of heads, by definition.\u201d  But \u201cfair\u201d is a structural property of the generative mechanism, not an epistemic guarantee about any particular trial after conditioning on extra information about the run.  A quick finite analogy makes the point vivid.\n\nFinite urn analogy: An urn contains 10,000 fair coins that have just been flipped, unseen.  You learn that at most one coin in the urn came up heads.  You pick one coin.  Do you still assign \u00bd to heads?  Plainly not: the conditional chance is \u22641/10,000.  The coin\u2019s physical fairness does nothing to prevent epistemic probability from shifting once you know something about correlations among outcomes.  \n\nThe infinite case is simply the limit of finer and finer finite urns, with the same verdict.\n\n7. Objections and replies  \nObjection 1 (Inadmissible conditioning).  Bayesian conditionalization is silent on measure-zero events; we therefore have no rational mandate.  \nReply.  Subjective Bayesianism indeed makes conditionalization on zero-probability events optional, but it does not forbid it.  As soon as a regular conditional exists and is uniquely defined by a limiting procedure that respects the symmetries of the problem, refusing to update amounts to throwing away information for no reason.  Moreover, the principal alternatives (Popper functions, Jeffrey conditionalization, or orthodox countable additivity plus limits) all agree in this case on assigning credence 0.  So conditional agnosticism is unmotivated.\n\nObjection 2 (Borel ambiguity).  Different ways of approximating F could yield different numbers; \u00bd is as good as 0.  \nReply.  The Borel paradox arises when the conditioning event is sensitive to coordinate choices.  F is permutation-invariant: any renaming of coins leaves it untouched.  Any approximation strategy that preserves that symmetry is forced to the same limit, as the argument of \u00a75 shows.  Approximation paths that break the symmetry (e.g., \u201clook only at even-numbered coins\u201d) introduce spurious information about who counts as even; rational agents who acknowledge they could have been any coin have no grounds to privilege such paths.\n\nObjection 3 (Self-locating uncertainty).  Maybe learning F gives you \u201ccentered\u201d rather than \u201cuncentered\u201d information: you learn you are not one of the infinitely many tail coins, but you might equally have been.  On the centered-worlds framework, perhaps \u00bd is defensible.  \nReply.  The information that only finitely many heads occurred is purely global; it does not single you out at all.  Every coin shares the same centered profile with respect to that fact.  So self-locating frameworks do not license a deviation from the permutation-invariant posterior, and we are back to 0.\n\nObjection 4 (Violation of minimal update).  The information does not mention my coin, so why should its probability change?  \nReply.  Minimal update is sound when the learned proposition is probabilistically independent of the target proposition.  But H\u2080 and F are highly dependent:  if H\u2080 obtains, F is already one head closer to being false.  Learning about a global scarcity of heads is evidence against any particular instance of heads.  There is no principle saying that propositions that do not name a variable are independent of it.\n\n8. A new conceptual distinction: local fairness vs. global pattern  \nWhat misleads many discussions is a failure to separate two notions.\n\nLocal fairness = Conditional on the bias parameter \u0398, each coin\u2019s chance of heads is \u0398.  \nGlobal pattern fairness = The prior distribution of \u0398 is unbiased (e.g., concentrated at \u00bd).  \n\nLearning F destroys global pattern fairness: it forces \u0398=0.  Local fairness survives only in the sense that P(H_i | \u0398=0)=\u0398, which is indeed \u201cfair\u201d given the new parameter value\u2014fairness is now fairness with respect to the degenerate trial where heads is impossible.  Seeing this distinction clarifies why no contradiction arises: the coin flips remain conditionally independent given \u0398, but the value of \u0398 has radically changed.\n\n9. Comparison with other philosophical cases  \nThe lesson mirrors what happens in two well-known probability puzzles.\n\n(1) The Banach\u2013Tarski spin-off: Conditioning on an invariant geometric property can alter local densities without affecting symmetry.  \n(2) The widely discussed \u201cHurdles\u201d variant of the Sleeping Beauty problem: Global frequency facts (e.g., that a coin landed tails) can force posterior credence about an awakening that does not explicitly mention that fact.\n\nIn both, learning a measure-zero global regularity collapses the hidden-parameter space to a lower-dimensional subspace, and local chances follow suit.\n\n10. What about finitely but enormously many heads?  \nBecause we are dealing with countably infinite agents, any finite upper bound K on heads generation gives the same limit of 0 for \u03bc(H\u2080 | \u201c\u2264 K heads\u201d).  The posterior credence goes to 0 roughly like K/n when the \u201cwho is n?\u201d envelope is widened.  So the precise value of the finite bound hardly matters; only infinitude vs. finitude matters.\n\n11. An illuminating variant: two stages of randomization  \nStage 1: A demon flips a fair meta-coin.  If tails, she decrees that all subsequent coin flips will be fair; if heads, she decrees that exactly 17 of the countable coins will be forced to heads, the rest to tails.  \nStage 2: The 17 indices (if any) are chosen uniformly without replacement; the remaining coins are forced tails or are flipped fairly depending on the Stage-1 outcome.\n\nBefore the announcement you place \u00bd on the demon\u2019s coin coming up heads.  After hearing \u201conly finitely many heads,\u201d you can\u2014from the finite-support of the Stage-1 parameter\u2014see that the posterior on the demon-heads hypothesis becomes 1 (because the tails-branch would have produced infinitely many heads with probability 1).  Then, within the demon-heads branch, your chance of being one of the 17 heads is 0 by the same permutation symmetry.  The staged construction reveals the logic without appeal to abstract theorems and shows that the 0 answer can be made fully explicit inside an enriched chance set-up.\n\n12. Philosophical upshot  \nThe problem is a vivid test case for the principle that conditional probability, not unconditional mechanism, governs rational belief.  It also illustrates the power\u2014and occasional peril\u2014of conditioning on probability-zero events.  Provided we respect the symmetries that fix the intended reference class, the mathematics selects a unique update, and that update makes heads literally incredible.\n\n13. Conclusion  \nYour coin is still physically fair in the sense that its micro-mechanism is unbiased; but after learning that heads as a global phenomenon was cut off at finitely many occurrences, you have overwhelming evidence that you are not one of the rare exceptions.  The only number compatible with the full symmetry of the case, the existence and uniqueness of regular conditional probabilities, and the standard Bayesian norm of learning from every shred of information, is 0.  A credence of \u00bd would amount to stubbornly clinging to an unconditional chance in the teeth of decisive, albeit measure-zero, evidence.  Reason, mathematics, and a properly nuanced understanding of fairness all point the other way.", "output_tokens": 4161, "reasoning_tokens": 1536}

Equip 2^\u2115 with the usual product \u03c3\u2013algebra and the product measure \u03bc that makes the \u03c9\u1d62 i.i.d. with P(\u03c9\u1d62 = 1)=\u00bd.  \u201cAll coins are fair and independent\u201d means \u201c\u03c9 is sampled from \u03bc.\u201d\n\nEvent H\u2080:\u2003\u03c9\u2080 = 1.  \nEvent F:\u2003Only finitely many heads occur; i.e. \u2211\u1d62 \u03c9\u1d62 < \u221e.\n\nIt is a classical theorem that \u03bc(F)=0, and indeed \u03bc(\u00acF)=1 by Kolmogorov\u2019s 0\u20131 law (almost surely there are infinitely many heads).

Independence.  The tosses were independent chances.  Learning facts about independent trials cannot rationally alter my opinion about this one.\n\nb.  The Principal Principle.  If objective chance that coin 0 lands heads is \u00bd, and I acquire no inadmissible information, my rational credence should track that chance.\n\nc.  Symmetry.  My coin is just like everyone else\u2019s; no head-or-tail asymmetry singles me out.\n\nd.  Subjective indistinguishability.  Before looking we are all in identical epistemic states: nobody could pick out the finitely many lucky head-holders.  So learning F seems not to supply evidence about which particular person I am.\n\nAll four thoughts are variants of a single motif: background independence plus ignorance pushes us toward the prior \u00bd.\n\nYet each of them, on inspection, equivocates between two very different kinds of update:\n\n(i) Bayesian conditioning on an event of positive probability.  \n(ii) Revising credence after being guaranteed an eventually falsifying piece of data\u2014a measure-0 occurrence.\n\nThe latter calls for something more delicate than ordinary conditionalisation, and that is the crux on which The Half founders.\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n\n3\u2003Why conditioning on F is treacherous  \n\nSuppose we try to treat F the way we treat an ordinary positive\u2010probability event.  Write, for any n\u2208\u2115,\n\n          F\u2099 : \u201cat most n heads occurred\u201d.\n\nEach F\u2099 has \u03bc(F\u2099)=0 as well, but we can approximate by finite-information events.  Fix m and let\n\n          F\u2099,\u2098 : \u201camong the first m coins, at most n are heads\u201d.\n\nNow \u03bc(F\u2099,\u2098) > 0.  Classical conditionalisation therefore tells us\n\n          \u03bc(H\u2080 | F\u2099,\u2098) = (expected number of heads among the first m coins,\n                           conditional on \u2264n of them being heads) / m.\n\nBecause of symmetry inside the first m coins, that conditional expected number is \u2264 n; hence\n\n          \u03bc(H\u2080 | F\u2099,\u2098) \u2264 n / m.\n\nHolding n fixed and letting m\u2192\u221e drives the ratio to 0.  In other words:\n\n(*)\u2003For every fixed n, lim\u2098 \u03bc(H\u2080 | F\u2099,\u2098)=0.\n\nObserve what we have done.  Instead of trying to define \u03bc(H\u2080 | F) by the ill-defined ratio \u03bc(H\u2080\u2227F)/\u03bc(F), we \u201ctelescope down\u201d from a family of positive-probability events F\u2099,\u2098 that converge monotonically to F.  The limiting conditional probability is 0, not \u00bd.  There is nothing ad hoc about the telescoping: the \u03c3-algebra generated by the tail events F\u2099 is obtained exactly by that sort of limit.\n\nOnce (\u2217) is in place, taking first m\u2192\u221e, then n\u2192\u221e, we obtain a bona fide regular conditional probability measure (RCP) on the \u03c3-algebra generated by F, and it satisfies\n\n          \u03bc_RCP(H\u2080 | F) = 0.\n\nBecause the standard Kolmogorov construction guarantees uniqueness of an RCP outside a \u03bc-null set, any mathematically rigorous conditioning procedure that (i) respects the exchangeability of the underlying process and (ii) is continuous under limiting refinements of information must deliver the same answer, namely The Zero.\n\nInformally: if you learn that only finitely many heads occurred, the symmetry that mattered changes.  Before learning F, the relevant comparison class was \u201call possible outcomes\u201d; after learning F it becomes \u201call outcomes with finitely many heads,\u201d and inside that class coin 0 is almost surely among the tails.\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n\n4\u2003A fully explicit construction of the posterior measure  \n\nSome readers worry that talk of \u201climiting RCPs\u201d is too abstract, so here is an elementary construction.\n\nRepresent an outcome \u03c9 in F by the finite set S(\u03c9) = { i : \u03c9\u1d62 = 1 }.  \nLet \u03a9_{fin} be the set of all finite subsets of \u2115.

For k=|S|,\n\n          \u03bd({S : |S|=k}) = c_k,   where \u2211_k c_k = 1,   c_k > 0,   and c_k \u2192 0.\n\nNow consider the random indicator X\u2080 that equals 1 if 0\u2208S and 0 otherwise.

Independence governs unconditional probabilities.  Conditional probabilities need not preserve it.  A classic one\u2010cube roll and one\u2010die roll are independent; but conditional on the sum being 3, the events \u201ccube lands 1\u201d and \u201cdie lands 2\u201d are perfectly correlated.  Here, learning F puts us in an analogous subset of measure space on which the former independence no longer holds.\n\nObjection 2.  \u201cThe Principal Principle demands credence \u00bd; chance of heads for coin 0 is still \u00bd.\u201d  \nReply.  The Principal Principle forbids updating on \u201cinadmissible\u201d evidence\u2014information that already screens off the chance.  F is exactly such evidence: knowing that only finitely many heads occur changes your epistemic situation vis-\u00e0-vis \u03c9\u2080 even though it does not change the objective chance at the time of tossing.  Lewis himself (1980, \u00a74.3) concedes that chance does not dictate posterior credence in the presence of de se or highly specific information.\n\nObjection 3.  \u201cBut I am not a randomly selected person; why should my credence mimic the probability that a random coin is heads?\u201d  \nReply.  The argument for The Zero does not require treating you as randomly selected.  It requires only the invariance of your evidence under any finite permutation of the agents.  Suppose, counterfactually, that your coin were heads but total heads were finite.  Then someone\u2019s coin (namely yours) would be distinguishable by possessing a feature\u2014\u201cis heads\u201d\u2014that holds of only finitely many coins.  Your total evidence, however, distinguishes nobody.  So in the space of worlds compatible with that evidence, the ones in which \u201cI am one of the finitely many special individuals\u201d form a \u03bd-null set.  Certainty of tails follows.\n\nObjection 4.  \u201cDoesn\u2019t Zero violate regularity?  Bayesianism forbids assigning probability 0 to contingent propositions.\u201d  \nReply.  Regularity forbids initial probability 0; it does not forbid posterior probability 0 after conditioning.  Learning that an event of prior probability 1 occurred (\u00acF), for example, can take one from \u00bd to 0 or 1 in the usual way.  Our case is the mirror image in an RCP setting.\n\nObjection 5.  \u201cThe result feels paradoxical\u2014surely my own coin could have been heads.\u201d  \nReply.  Modal possibility is untouched: there are worlds in which H\u2080\u2227F.  What rationality compels after learning F is not metaphysical impossibility but epistemic certainty that the actual world is not one of those.  Compare Yablo\u2019s Hydra: it is possible for a dart to hit any particular head of the infinitely\u2010many-headed hydra, yet conditional on \u201conly finitely many dart strikes,\u201d each particular head is almost surely unhit.\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n\nConclusion  \n\nThe finite\u2010heads announcement does provide information relevant to your own coin, even though it does not single you out by name.  The appropriate mathematical machinery for handling such \u201cprobability-0 updates\u201d is the theory of regular conditional probabilities, and when one applies it in an exchangeability-respecting way one gets P*(H\u2080)=0.  Appeals to independence or to the Principal Principle overlook that the evidential context has changed the sample space on which conditioning must be performed.\n\nThanks to that change, the symmetry of the problem transforms from \u201ceach coin is equally likely to be heads\u201d to \u201ceach coin is vastly more likely to be tails, because only finitely many heads exist at all.\u201d  Rational credence tracks that transformed symmetry, not the earlier one.  So your coin, like almost every coin, is (epistemically) surely a tail.\n\nA parting moral.  If one wants to preserve the intuition behind The Half, what must be rejected is not the mathematics but the rule that ordinary Bayesian conditioning (or its RCP extension) captures rational response to information.  Doing so comes at a high price: one loses a uniquely well\u2010behaved update rule and risks inconsistency in similar \u201cmeasure-zero revelation\u201d cases.

The Set-Up and the Tension  \n\nImagine an \u03c9-sequence \u27e8C0,C1,C2,\u2026\u27e9 of independent, fair coin flips.  You are person 0: coin C0 sits sealed in front of you.  The organiser now announces:  \n\n          F:  \u201cOf all the infinitely many coins, only finitely many landed heads.\u201d  \n\nBefore hearing F you assign \u00bd to the proposition H0 that your own coin shows heads.  After you learn F, what is the rational posterior credence P(H0 | F)?  \n\nTwo intuitions collide.  \nA. Independence: \u201cWhatever the others did, my coin was tossed fairly; it should still be \u00bd.\u201d  \nB. Proportion: \u201cGiven F, the limiting frequency of heads is 0; randomly \u2018being me\u2019 is almost surely being a tail; the answer should be 0.\u201d  \n\nA satisfactory account must explain why one of these pulls outruns the other, and it must do so without hand-waving because F has probability 0.  I shall argue that a fully adequate Bayesian treatment yields P(H0 | F)=0.  Roughly, F destroys the independence on which the \u00bd-intuition trades, and once we understand how to condition on measure-zero tail events in an exchangeable setting, the 0-answer falls out.  I also show why the competing \u00bd-answer is tempting yet ultimately incoherent.  Finally I extract two broader morals: (i) genuine learning from probability-zero information is possible and sometimes forced, and (ii) the right update rule is not \u201cindependence at all costs\u201d but \u201crespect the symmetries that survive the new evidence.\u201d  \n\n\n2. Why Standard Bayes Cannot Be Blindly Applied  \n\nTextbook Bayes presupposes a conditioning event of positive probability.  If P(F)=0, P(A | F)=P(A\u2227F)/P(F) is undefined.  One response is to declare the question meaningless.  But that would be defeatist: we routinely learn events we assigned probability 0\u2014continuous observations (\u201cthe dart landed at exactly \u03c0 cm\u201d), ideal limit statements (\u201cthe series diverges\u201d), or, here, tail events singled out by omniscient announcers.  Probability theory therefore supplies a more general tool: regular conditional probabilities.  The idea is that, although F itself has measure 0, it can be approached by a nested sequence of positive-probability events on which limits of conditional probabilities exist.  Whether the limit is unique depends on background symmetries.  So the real issue is: given the exchangeability of the coins and the content of F, which limiting procedure is rational?  \n\n\n\n3. Exchangeability, Tail \u03c3-Fields, and 0-1 Laws  \n\nThe joint distribution of the infinite sequence is exchangeable: permuting indices leaves probabilities invariant.  De Finetti\u2019s theorem teaches us that such a distribution is a mixture of i.i.d. Bernoulli sequences with some random bias \u0398; here \u0398 is point-mass at \u00bd, so unconditionally each coin is independent and fair.  \n\nF is a tail event: its truth value does not depend on any finite initial segment.  Kolmogorov\u2019s 0-1 law then entails P(F)=0 or 1; straightforward calculation gives 0.  Crucially, however, the law also tells us that conditional on the tail \u03c3-field the coins become *conditionally independent but no longer identically distributed*.  The posterior distribution may assign extreme biases (0 or 1) depending on which tail event obtains.  Hence we should expect independence across coins to survive but their marginal probabilities to shift.  \n\nIntuition A smuggles in the illegitimate premise that the marginal \u00bd survives every update.  Once F is learned, the mixture representation collapses onto that measure-zero component of the sample space in which \u0398=0.  After all, a sequence with only finitely many heads has limiting frequency 0; the only de Finetti component compatible with F is \u0398=0.  And given \u0398=0, every individual coin is almost surely tail.  Formally,  \n\n      P(H0 | F) = \u222b P(H0 | \u0398) dP(\u0398 | F) = \u222b \u0398 dP(\u0398 | F) = 0.  \n\nSo the defeasible independence given the original mixture *does* propagate, but with a new, data-driven bias 0.  The right posterior is therefore 0.  \n\n\n\n4. A Concrete Construction: Approximating F from Below  \n\nSome moralists distrust the abstract appeal to de Finetti.  Here is a hands-on limiting argument.  Let  \n\n      Fn,k : \u201cAt most k heads appear among the first n coins.\u201d  \n\nEvery Fn,k has positive probability.  Moreover, F = \u22c2\u221ek=0 \u22c3\u221em=1 \u22c2n\u2265m Fn,k.  Define  \n\n      Pn,k(A) := P(A | Fn,k).  \n\nTake limits in two stages: first n\u2192\u221e for fixed k, then k\u2192\u221e.  One shows:\n\n(a)  limn\u2192\u221e Pn,k(H0) = k/(n+1) \u2192 0.  (Because conditioning on at most k heads in n+1 coins forces the relative frequency of heads to \u2264k/(n+1).)\n\n(b)  Since 0 is independent of k after the first limit, limk\u2192\u221e of the whole expression remains 0.  \n\nThus any \u201creasonable\u201d net of approximations yields the same answer 0.  That uniqueness is driven by the full exchangeability of the scenario; break the symmetry (e.g., make earlier coins differently weighted) and non-uniqueness can re-emerge.  \n\n\n\n5. Rebuking the \u00bd-Intuition  \n\n\u201cBut I tossed my coin in ignorance of F!  Surely its physical propensity is still \u00bd.\u201d  Two replies.  \n\nFirst, propensity is not posterior credence.  You happily assign credence <1 to physical certainties whenever you acquire evidence they didn\u2019t produce the outcome (e.g., knowing a double-headed coin was nevertheless put with its heads scratched).  Learning F is *evidence about the outcome*, not about the mechanism.  \n\nSecond, the dependence introduced by conditioning is not spooky: it is exactly what we expect in finite lotteries.  Suppose a thousand fair coins are tossed behind a curtain and you learn \u201cat most one came up heads.\u201d  Your chance of being the (possibly unique) head is 1/1000, not \u00bd.  The infinite case is the limit k=1, n\u2192\u221e.  Indifference to position then forces the probability to tend to 0.  The difference is only that in the infinite case your prior gave \u201cat most finitely many heads\u201d probability 0, so na\u00efve Bayes lacked the resources to update.  \n\nA subtler halfers\u2019 argument appeals to \u201cepistemic rigidity\u201d: rational updates must respect *local* autonomy; learning a global restriction on the entire sequence should not alter credences about any given coordinate because that coordinate is screen-off independent of the others.  The fallacy is that screen-off independence itself fails once we project onto the zero-probability manifold.  In fact, the halfers\u2019 principle is inconsistent: it jointly endorses (i) exchangeability, (ii) learning F, and (iii) retaining \u00bd for every coin.  But (i)+(iii) imply the expected number of heads is infinite, contradicting (ii).  At most two of the three can be held; jettisoning (iii) is the only option that keeps the others and respects the information explicitly announced.  \n\n\n\n6. Objection: \u201cZero Posterior Makes Heads Epistemically Impossible\u201d  \n\nIs assigning 0 irrationally dogmatic?  Suppose, after forming the 0-credence, you actually peek and see H0.  You would then have updated on another probability-0 event: \u201cH0 given F.\u201d  That is not self-defeating: Bayesianism permits nested conditionings on successive zero-events.  In fact the posterior after learning both F and H0 becomes a finitely supported distribution over how many additional heads there are\u2014roughly, \u201cexactly k more\u201d for each k\u2014but the procedure is perfectly well-defined.  The lesson is that 0 credence is not an absolute ban; it is merely the best point estimate prior to further data.  \n\nA technical moral emerges: one must treat regular conditional probabilities as *families* defined almost everywhere; they assign 0 or 1 to many propositions but can still be coherently re-conditioned on stronger information.  The philosopher\u2019s squeamishness about 0 is unfounded.  \n\n\n\n7. Dialectical Pay-Off: Surviving Symmetries  \n\nWhat, then, is the governing principle?  It is not the independence of causal mechanisms; it is the requirement that your posterior preserve *those* symmetries\u2014no more, no less\u2014that are compatible with the new evidence.  Learning F leaves permutation invariance intact (F is symmetric) but destroys any symmetry between heads and tails (F favours tails massively).  The only distribution satisfying the surviving invariances is the one which makes every coin almost surely tail.  That is exactly the distribution picked out by the de Finetti collapse argument.  \n\nOnce articulated, the principle generalises.  Tail announcements of the form \u201cfrequency = p\u201d force the posterior to assign bias p; the present case is the limiting one p=0.  Conversely, announcements also symmetric under head\u2013tail exchange, such as \u201cinfinitely many heads and infinitely many tails,\u201d leave the \u00bd bias intact.  The dependence of rational credence shifts on the *content of the tail event* vindicates the intuitive idea that some global information is evidentially relevant and some is not, without treating independence as sacrosanct.  \n\n\n\n8. Relation to Anthropic and Self-Locating Reasoning  \n\nOne may wonder whether the above relies on a controversial \u201cI am a random sample\u201d assumption.  In fact the assumption was not extra; it is built into the problem statement.  You are one among a countable infinity of *qualitatively identical* flippers.  The probability model you started with already treats \u201cam I number 0?\u201d as random with uniform distribution over \u03c9 (technically an improper prior), and the organiser\u2019s announcement F does nothing to distinguish you except via the outcome of C0.  Thus no anthropic principle beyond ordinary permutation invariance is invoked.  \n\nInterestingly, if the participants were *ordered in time* and you learned, say, that \u201conly finitely many heads occur *after time N*,\u201d the symmetry would break and the posterior for the early coins could differ from that for late coins.  The present puzzle hence provides a clean laboratory for de-confounding anthropic reasoning: pure symmetry plus a tail fact yields the zero posterior without any controversial \u201cself-sampling\u201d assumptions.  \n\n\n\n9. Extensions and Open Questions  \n\n(i) Finite but Huge.  Replace \u201cfinitely many\u201d by \u201cat most k.\u201d  The posterior is k/\u03c9 = 0.  The qualitative conclusion is robust.  \n\n(ii) Different Priors.  Suppose instead the prior bias were itself random with density on (0,1).  Then conditioning on F would still collapse the posterior of \u0398 to 0.  Hence the result is prior-robust across the standard exchangeable family.  \n\n(iii) Weakening Countable Additivity.  Some authors propose finitely additive (\u201cshift-invariant\u201d) priors on \u03c9-sequences that assign *positive* measure to F.  Under such priors one can recover P(H0 | F)=\u00bd.  The cost is abandoning countable additivity, thereby flouting the standard probability calculus.  Whether that trade-off is acceptable is a live foundational debate.  My own view is that giving up countable additivity to save the \u00bd-intuition is too high a price; too many other theorems (law of large numbers, 0-1 laws, Martingale convergence) ride on it.  \n\n(iv) Decision-Theoretic Stakes.  Suppose you must now bet at odds 1:1 on H0.  Accepting would be Dutch-bookable: a bookie could sell the same bet to each of the infinitely many agents, and because only finitely many coins win, the bookie pays out finitely but collects infinitely, guaranteeing profit.  The zero posterior vindicates the sure-thing principle in this infinite economy.  \n\n\n\n10. Conclusion  \n\nWhen the organiser reveals that only finitely many among countably many fair coins landed heads, rational credence that one\u2019s own coin is heads plummets from \u00bd to 0.  The key is that tail information, though assigned prior probability 0, is nonetheless epistemically potent: it collapses de Finetti mixtures and thereby changes marginal probabilities.  Independence considerations do not survive this collapse; what survives is permutation symmetry, and respecting it uniquely determines the zero posterior.  Retaining the \u00bd-credence would violate exchangeability once the global restriction is taken seriously and would set one up for a guaranteed betting loss in an infinite market.  \n\nMore broadly, the case illustrates how Bayesian reasoning can coherently assimilate probability-zero events without lapsing into dogmatism, provided we employ the right notion of conditional probability.  The lesson generalises: whenever new evidence is highly non-local, we must re-evaluate which structural symmetries endure, rather than naively clinging to local independence.

A rational Bayesian who started with the usual product measure over {H,T}^\u2115 should update to credence 0 (strictly, become certain of tails) for her own coin. Keeping the old \u00bd is not merely optional; it conflicts with countable additivity, with any regular method of conditioning on null events, and with a simple domination argument about expected head-counts. I first show why 0 is the uniquely coherent update, then rebut the main symmetry-based objection, and finally draw some philosophical morals about learning from probability-zero information.\n\n2. Why the orthodox conditional probability machinery points to 0  \n\n2.1  The obstacle: probability-zero conditioning  \n\nSimple ratio conditionalisation P(A\u2223B)=P(A\u2227B)/P(B) is undefined when P(B)=0, so we need a more refined tool. In standard probability theory the relevant object is a regular conditional probability distribution\u2014roughly, a measurable function Q(\u22c5,\u03c9) such that for almost every \u03c9, Q(\u22c5,\u03c9) is a probability measure and Q(A,\u03c9)=E[1_A\u2223\ud835\udd05](\u03c9) for every event A, where \ud835\udd05 is the \u03c3-field you are conditioning on. Tail events such as F form a sub-\u03c3-field (the tail \u03c3-field), and Kolmogorov\u2019s existence theorem guarantees a regular conditional for it.\n\n2.2  Approximating the null event  \n\nOne concrete way to see what that regular conditional must be is to approximate F from above by a descending sequence of positive-probability events and take limits. Let\n\nF_n : \u201cat most n heads occur overall\u201d.\n\nBecause the sequence (F_n) shrinks to F and P(F_n)\u21920, the Bayes formula for finite n yields well-defined conditional probabilities:\n\nP(H\u2080\u2223F_n)=P(H\u2080\u2227F_n)/P(F_n).\n\nIf these ratios have a unique limit as n\u2192\u221e, that limit is forced upon any regular conditional version for F.\n\n2.3  Computing the finite-n conditionals  \n\nBy exchangeability prior to the update, every coin is probabilistically distinguished only by its index. Therefore\n\nE[#Heads \u2223 F_n]=\u2211_{k=0}^{\u221e}P(H_k\u2223F_n)=\u221e\u00b7P(H\u2080\u2223F_n).\n\nBut F_n itself asserts that the random variable #Heads is bounded above by n. Taking expectations,\n\nE[#Heads \u2223 F_n] \u2264 n.\n\nHence\n\n\u221e\u00b7P(H\u2080\u2223F_n) \u2264 n, \u2003so\u2003P(H\u2080\u2223F_n)=0.\n\nSince each finite-n conditional is already zero, the limit is trivially zero. Therefore any regular conditional probability for the tail \u03c3-field must assign\n\nP(H\u2080\u2223F)=0.\n\nThat settles the mathematics: among the class of updates that respect the Kolmogorov axioms, 0 is the only value available.\n\n3. Why the symmetry objection fails  \n\nMany people\u2019s first reaction is that perfect symmetry ought to preserve the \u00bd. After all, every coin was fair and independent; the information you received seems \u201cglobal\u201d and does not single out your coin. So why not stick with \u00bd?\n\n3.1  The hidden asymmetry introduced by F  \n\nThe global information is highly non-neutral. Saying there are only finitely many heads is equivalent to saying \u201call but finitely many coins are tails\u201d. While that statement does not designate which individuals are heads, it drastically constrains the combinatorics of the sequence. In a world in which F is true, the proportion of heads is 0. Someone who calls herself \u201ccoin 0\u201d is almost surely among the sea of tails, not among the rare heads. The fact that every individual coin is *a priori* symmetrical does not prevent almost all of them from winding up in the majority category once a very skewed global constraint is imposed.\n\nA finite analogy helps. Suppose three people each toss a fair coin but are told only that *at most one* head occurred. Symmetry remains, yet the probability that your own coin is heads is 1/3, not 1/2. The principle of indifference asks us to treat like indices alike, not to ignore the information about the collective outcome. Pushing the \u201cat most one\u201d bound farther and farther while letting the population grow without limit drives the individual conditional probability all the way to 0.\n\n3.2  Exchangeability breaks upon conditioning  \n\nTechnically, the prior measure is exchangeable; the posterior conditioned on F is not. De Finetti\u2019s representation theorem tells us that an exchangeable infinite sequence is a mixture of i.i.d. sequences with some latent bias \u03b8. The event F has posterior probability one only in the degenerate sub-mixture where \u03b8=0; all coordinates are tails. Hence updating on F collapses the mixture to that point, destroying the symmetry that would entitle each coin to weight \u00bd.\n\n3.3  Optional stopping and Dutch books  \n\nIf you stubbornly retain \u00bd, you can be Dutch-booked. Consider the bet that pays \\$1 if your coin shows tails and costs \\$0.75 up front. At \u00bd you regard this as a fair gamble (expected value \\$0), but conditional on F the payoff is \\$1 with certainty: the bookmaker pockets \\$0.25 risk free. Rational agents should avoid being exploitable by learning\u2014that is why Bayesian conditionalisation exists. The Dutch book demonstrates that clinging to \u00bd after learning F violates that norm.\n\n4. Why alternative update rules do not rescue \u00bd  \n\n4.1  The Jeffrey-conditionalisation excuse  \n\nOne might suggest a Jeffrey update: you merely *shift* some credence to F without making it certain, because P(F)=0 made that impossible. But the thought experiment explicitly stipulates that you learn F with certainty. If you are certain of F, any probabilistic representation that still allocates positive mass to \u00acF misrepresents your total evidence.\n\n4.2  Popper functions and infinitesimals  \n\nAnother dodge is to model prior disbelief in F with an infinitesimal \u03b5 rather than literal 0, then update in the usual way. But the \u03b5-approximation simply recovers the limit above: as \u03b5\u21920, the conditional probability of H\u2080 given F\u21920 as well. The infinitesimal\u2010Bayesian cannot get \u00bd without abandoning the \u03b5\u21920 limit\u2014and therefore abandoning the agreement with the original countably additive prior.\n\n4.3  The Borel\u2013Kolmogorov paradox  \n\nSometimes conditional probabilities on measure-zero sets depend on the way the set is approached; think of conditioning on a point on the sphere. The present case is not like that: any downward approximation of F by events \u201c\u2264n heads\u201d gives 0, and those events generate the same \u03c3-field as F. There is no coordinate\u2010dependent paradox here.\n\n5. Philosophical payoff  \n\n5.1  Learning the impossible  \n\nBayesians are often told they cannot learn something to which they assigned prior probability 0. The present case shows that they can\u2014provided they are willing to update to *certainty*, thereby forcing posterior probabilities for many related events to take extreme (0 or 1) values. That is precisely what happens here. Nothing in the Kolmogorov axioms forbids it; the only casualty is those comfortable symmetries we thought would survive any amount of data.\n\n5.2  Countable additivity earns its keep  \n\nWhy take the drastic step all the way to 0? Because refusing to do so breaks countable additivity. Suppose you insist on P(H_k\u2223F)=\u00bd for each k. Then, by additivity,\n\nE[#Heads \u2223 F]=\u2211_{k=0}^{\u221e}\u00bd=\u221e,\n\ncontradicting the information that #Heads is finite. The update to 0 is forced once we accept the basic probability calculus; to maintain \u00bd we would have to retreat to a finitely additive probability measure or some non-standard epistemic logic.\n\n5.3  Infinite contexts magnify small asymmetries  \n\nIn a finite setting, learning \u201cat most n heads\u201d merely lowers your credence from \u00bd to n/(n+\u2026+?), i.e. something modest. In the limit of countably many tosses, that modest shift gets multiplied by infinity and collapses to 0. Infinite cases often act as magnifying lenses: subtle constraints at the aggregate level crush local symmetries, offering a lesson for debates over self-locating credence, anthropic reasoning, and cosmic fine\u2010tuning.\n\n6.

That, if anything, is a vivid reminder that epistemic probability is about what you *know*, not what nature has objectively wired into the world.", "output_tokens": 3484, "reasoning_tokens": 1344}

The puzzle in outline  \nA fair coin, tossed in isolation, gives each of us a familiar \u00bd-credence in heads.  Now imagine that you and countably many companions all toss such coins simultaneously and independently.  At first blush nothing seems to change for any particular participant\u2014why should what a distant stranger flips affect the intrinsic workings of my own coin?  Yet you are suddenly handed the extraordinary news that, out of the \u03c9 = \u2135\u2080 many tosses, only finitely many have landed heads.  The question is whether, on receiving that information, your degree of belief that *your* coin is heads should remain \u00bd or move elsewhere.  Intuition splits.  One line says \u201cIndependence!  My coin does not know what happened elsewhere; my credence stays \u00bd.\u201d  Another line says \u201cHeads have become exceedingly scarce; by symmetry my coin should now be almost certainly tails.\u201d  I shall argue for the latter: conditional on the zero-measure event that only finitely many heads occurred, the probability that *any given* coin\u2014including yours\u2014is 0.  So rational credence should collapse from \u00bd to 0.  I then explore why the intuitive pull of independence misfires, how one can make sense of updating on probability-zero events, and what broader lessons the case teaches about symmetry, conditional expectation, and the epistemology of \u201calmost impossible\u201d information.\n\n2. The technical snag: conditioning on measure-zero events  \nClassical Bayesian conditionalisation sets\n\n         P(H | E) = P(H\u2227E)/P(E)                                               (1)\n\nwhenever P(E) > 0.  In our prior probability measure\u2014the product measure on {H,T}^\u03c9 generated by independent fair coins\u2014the event\n\n         F = {only finitely many heads}\n\nhas probability 0.  The strong law of large numbers implies that with probability 1 the relative frequency of heads converges to \u00bd; in particular, infinitely many heads occur almost surely.  So equation (1) is undefined.\n\nBayesian orthodoxy therefore needs refinement when agents learn an \u201cimpossible\u201d fact.  Mathematicians supply *regular conditional probabilities*; philosophers discuss *Jeffrey* or *imaging* updates, *Kullback-Leibler* projections, or Lewis\u2019s *radical conditionalisation*.  While the details differ, nearly all mainstream approaches agree on two desiderata:\n\nD1. *Conformance*: the posterior must assign probability 1 to the learned event F.  \nD2. *Minimality/Symmetry*: absent further evidence, the posterior should preserve the symmetries built into the prior, subject to satisfying D1.\n\nI show that any posterior satisfying both requirements forces P(H_i | F)=0 for each participant i.  The argument is elementary yet powerful, and does not depend on which exact recipe for probability-zero updating one favours, provided it respects D1 and D2.\n\n3. Why symmetry plus finitude entails zero credence in heads  \n\nStep 1: Exchangeability.  \nBefore learning anything, the joint distribution of coin outcomes is *exchangeable*: any finite permutation of indices leaves probabilities unchanged.  Learning F (\u201conly finitely many heads\u201d) does not single out any participant\u2014F is itself permutation-invariant.  So by D2 the updated measure remains exchangeable.  Consequently there exists a common conditional probability\n\n         q := P(H_i | F)          for every i\u2208\u2115.                             (2)\n\nStep 2: Expected number of heads given F.  \nLet X_i be the indicator of heads on coin i, and let N := \u03a3_{i=1}^{\u221e} X_i.  We know that on F the random variable N takes a *finite* value.  Hence its conditional expectation is finite:\n\n         E[N | F] < \u221e.                                                        (3)\n\nBut by countable additivity and (2),\n\n         E[N | F] = \u03a3_{i=1}^{\u221e} E[X_i | F] = \u03a3_{i=1}^{\u221e} q.                  (4)\n\nIf q were any positive real number \u03b5 > 0, the right-hand side of (4) would diverge to \u221e, contradicting finitude.  Therefore\n\n         q = 0.                                                              (5)\n\nHence P(H_i | F)=0 for every participant.  By symmetry that includes *your* coin.\n\nThis is the entire argument.  It relies only on exchangeability and finite expectation\u2014axioms already accepted by orthodox probability theory.  So, barring rejection of countable additivity (a radical move I discuss briefly in \u00a78), the unique rational posterior makes every particular coin *almost surely* tails.\n\n4. Addressing the independence objection  \nThe sticking point for many is the feeling that \u201cmy\u201d coin and the event F concern disjoint, independent parts of reality; how can learning about a global pattern touch the local physical propensity of my coin?  The mistake comes from confusing *causal* or *physical* independence with *probabilistic* independence conditional on evidence.  In the prior measure, each coin is indeed probabilistically independent from any *finite* statement about the others, but F is an *infinitary* statement.  Because it quantifies over the entire \u03c9-sequence, it creates long-range statistical correlations.\n\nA familiar finite analogue dissolves the intuition.  Suppose three fair coins are tossed and you learn that *at most one* landed heads.  That information makes heads rarer, and your updated credence that *your* coin is heads falls from \u00bd to \u2153.  No one finds this surprising.  The infinite case merely extends the same logic: \u201cat most finitely many heads\u201d is an even stronger constraint, driving the updated credence down from \u00bd to the infimum 0 rather than to a positive fraction.\n\n5. A concrete limit calculation  \nSome worry that the expectation argument hides measure-theoretic subtleties.  One can instead approximate F by a decreasing sequence of finite-probability events and take limits.  Fix k \u2208 \u2115.  Let\n\n         F_k^n = {among the first n coins, at most k heads have occurred}.\n\nFor each fixed k, P(F_k^n) > 0.  Compute\n\n         P(H_1 & F_k^n) = (\u00bd)\u00b7P(at most k\u22121 heads among coins 2\u2026n).       (6)\n         P(F_k^n)       = P(at most k heads among coins 1\u2026n).               (7)\n\nElementary combinatorics shows\n\n         P(H_1 | F_k^n) = [k/(n+1)].                                        (8)\n\nAs n\u2192\u221e with k fixed, this ratio tends to 0.  Now let k run over \u2115; the event F is \u22c3_k lim_{n\u2192\u221e} F_k^n.  Standard theorems on regular conditional probabilities identify the conditional measure with the limit of such ratios, yielding P(H_1 | F)=0 directly, free of appeal to symmetry.  Thus the abstract expectation argument and the concrete combinatorial limit coincide.\n\n6. Philosophical morals about learning the \u201cimpossible\u201d  \na) Zero-probability learning is coherent.  \nSceptics sometimes claim Bayesianism breaks when one gains information of measure zero.  The present analysis shows otherwise: regular conditionals are well-defined, and they can radically shift point-probabilities.\n\nb) Discontinuity is rational.  \nYour credence in heads plummets from \u00bd to 0 despite learning something that, according to your earlier beliefs, was almost impossible.  This need not violate van Fraassen\u2019s *Reflection* principle, because you assigned prior probability 0 to being in a future epistemic state that conditions on F.  Reflection forbids you from expecting to expect differently; it does not forbid what happens in probability-zero branches of the sample space.\n\nc) \u201cIndependence\u201d is context-sensitive.  \nEvents can be causally or physically independent yet statistically dependent once conditioning on global constraints.  The infinite setting magnifies this familiar phenomenon.\n\n7. Dialectical engagement: can heads retain non-zero probability?  \n\nObjection 1: *Why can\u2019t the conditional probabilities be q_i=2^{\u2212i}?*  \nIndeed, \u03a3_{i=1}^{\u221e} 2^{\u2212i}=1<\u221e, so the expectation bound would remain finite.  The answer is symmetry.  F treats every participant alike; introducing heterogeneous q_i would be unmotivated and would violate D2.\n\nObjection 2: *Regularity itself is suspect; perhaps conditional expectations over countably infinite sums should not be required to be countably additive.*  \nThis suggestion effectively abandons Kolmogorov axioms and thereby much of standard probability theory.  One can develop non-countably-additive frameworks (e.g. finitely additive Loeb measures), but they impose high costs\u2014losing the law of large numbers, for example.  Moreover, any finitely additive exchangeable probability that conditions on F and preserves finite-value expectation must still set q=0, by an adaptation of de Finetti\u2019s theorem.  So the verdict survives.\n\nObjection 3: *The answer 0 seems too extreme\u2014after all, finitely many \u2260 no heads.*  \nTrue, 0 is a limit rather than a strict impossibility.  In the posterior distribution there is indeed positive probability that *some* coins are heads\u2014just no information about which.  For every finite set of participants the probability that all of them are tails is 1.  So although heads do occur, they appear only *in the idealised infinite outskirts*, never in any particular finitely-specifiable place.  This illustrates how infinite probabilistic structures can \u201cpush mass off to infinity,\u201d a phenomenon familiar from non-\u03c3-compact spaces in topology.\n\n8. A brief note on radical replies  \nTwo radical escapes remain.  (i) Reject countable additivity; (ii) Adopt a *non-standard* prior under which P(F)>0.  Both moves are costly.  Without countable additivity, we lose the law of large numbers and stochastic independence behaves oddly; yet even then, any exchangeable finitely additive measure that mirrors the fair-coin marginals assigns F probability zero.  As for altering the prior, the puzzle precisely fixes the prior as the product of fair Bernoullis; changing it is changing the subject.\n\n9. Lessons for epistemology and the philosophy of probability  \nThis case brings three wider morals.\n\n1. Updating on global, structural information can swamp local independence.  This undercuts facile appeals to \u201cscreening off\u201d in debates over anthropic reasoning and cosmological fine-tuning, where similar infinities loom large.\n\n2. The need to handle probability-zero updates is not esoteric: any agent with continuum-valued credences faces them whenever she encounters idealised infinitely precise measurements (\u201cthe needle lands exactly at \u221a2 radians\u201d), so a principled recipe is mandatory.\n\n3. Infinite-population puzzles sharpen our grasp of symmetry principles.  Here it is permutation invariance, not any exotic metaphysics, that drives the result.  Debates over the Principle of Indifference or over self-locating belief can profit from paying close attention to how symmetries fix conditional probabilities.\n\n10. Conclusion  \nReceiving the astonishing bulletin that only finitely many heads occurred radically reshapes rational expectation: by the joint force of exchangeability and finite expected head-count, your credence that *your* coin landed heads must fall from \u00bd to 0.  The independence intuition falters because it overlooks how infinitary constraints forge statistical dependencies.  Far from exposing a flaw in Bayesianism, the puzzle showcases the depth and coherence of conditional probability once we admit regular conditionals.  Philosophically, the episode reminds us that learning the nearly impossible can rationally induce discontinuous shifts in belief, that symmetry considerations sometimes determine unique posteriors, and that the infinite often behaves in ways our finite-bred intuitions find surprising but, on reflection, perfectly logical.", "output_tokens": 4713, "reasoning_tokens": 1984}

Yet the announcement \u201conly finitely many heads were tossed\u201d is not innocent background information.  It is an epistemically radical constraint on the global outcome.  In what follows I argue that a rational Bayesian who learns this fact should revise her credence for her own coin\u2019s having landed heads all the way down to 0.

Setting the stage: three sources of tension  \n\n(i)  Symmetry.  Before any information, you rationally assign \u00bd to each coin, and by exchangeability each coin gets the same number.  \n\n(ii)  The finite-heads report E.  Given a countably infinite sequence of fair independent tosses, P(E) = 0.  So standard Bayes cannot simply compute P(H\u2080|E) = P(H\u2080\u2227E)/P(E).  \n\n(iii)  Independence expectations.  If each coin retained probability \u00bd, then\u2014independence aside\u2014the expected number of heads would remain \u2211\u2099\u00bd = \u221e, blatantly contradicting the content of E (\u201conly finitely many heads\u201d).  \n\nThese three points cannot all stand together; something has to give.\n\n2.  Why ordinary conditionalisation breaks down  \n\nBayes\u2019 rule applies only when the conditioning event has positive probability, yet P(E)=0.  Still, there is a principled Bayesian way to update: pick a sequence of positive-probability events that approximate E ever more closely, condition on those, and take the limit.  If the result is well-defined and independent of the approximating sequence, we treat it as the rational posterior.  This procedure\u2014sometimes called the limit method, sometimes \u201cvan Fraassen conditionalisation\u201d\u2014is widely accepted when dealing with continuum events or idealisations such as infinitely many trials.\n\n3.  A limiting-sequence update that drives the probability to 0  \n\nLet H\u2080 be the proposition \u201cmy coin landed heads\u201d.  For each positive integer N let  \n\nA_N  =  \u201cat most N coins in total landed heads.\u201d  \n\nA_N \u2193 E as N\u2192\u221e, and each A_N has strictly positive probability.  Compute  \n\n   P(H\u2080 | A_N)  =  P(H\u2080 \u2227 A_N)/P(A_N).                       (1)\n\nBecause the tosses are independent and each has probability \u00bd of heads or tails,\n\n   P(H\u2080 \u2227 A_N) = \u00bd \u00b7 P(\u201camong the other coins, \u2264 N\u20131 heads\u201d).  \n\nBut \u201camong the other coins, \u2264 N\u20131 heads\u201d is an event about countably many fair tosses whose probability is 0 (for any fixed N\u20131).  Intuitively the Law of Large Numbers makes the proportion of heads oscillate around \u00bd with unboundedly many heads almost surely.  In fact, by Kolmogorov\u2019s 0-1 law any tail event such as A_N has probability 0 or 1; here it is 0.  Hence the numerator of (1) is 0.  The denominator too is 0, so we need finer control.\n\nWe refine the approximation.  Let B_M = \u201cat most N heads in the first M coins\u201d.  For fixed N, P(B_M) > 0, and as M\u2192\u221e, B_M \u2191 A_N.  Writing everything out, one finds\n\n   lim_{M\u2192\u221e} P(H\u2080 | B_M) = (N / (M+1)) \u2192 0.  \n\nFinally, take N\u2192\u221e; we still obtain 0.  No matter which reasonable route one takes toward E, the conditional probability of H\u2080 converges to 0.  Far from being an artefact of the particular sequence, the result is enforced by the tail-\u03c3-algebra structure: in every fair infinite product measure, \u201cfinitely many heads\u201d pins down the limiting frequency \u03b8 to 0, and conditional on \u03b8=0 the chance of any particular coin being a head is precisely 0.\n\n4.  An expectation argument: symmetry + finitude \u21d2 0  \n\nThere is a more transparent route that does not rely on measure-theoretic niceties.\n\nLet q be your credence in \u201ccoin n is heads\u201d after learning E.  By the symmetry of the problem, every coin gets the same posterior marginal q.  Expected total number of heads, by linearity of expectation, equals \u2211\u2099 q.  But E informs you that the actual number is finite.  A rational posterior must therefore make that expected number finite too; otherwise you would be certain to see your expectation violated.  The only way a sum of countably many identical non-negative terms can be finite is if each term is 0.  Hence q = 0.  \n\nThis argument bypasses the independence assumption.  Even if after the update the outcomes are wildly dependent, so long as the marginals stay equal the expectation calculation holds.\n\nNotice how the argument undermines the tempting \u201cit was a fair coin, so \u00bd\u201d reaction.  Fairness guarantees \u00bd only under the prior measure.  Once you have ruled out all but a measure-zero slice of prior possibilities, you are no longer reasoning within that measure.  Posterior fairness evaporates.\n\n5.  Regular conditional probabilities and tail events  \n\nFormally, a regular conditional probability \u03bc(\u00b7|E) for the product measure exists and is almost surely unique.  For Kolmogorov product measures of i.i.d. Bernoulli(\u00bd) variables, tail events like E are generated by the \u03c3-field invariant under finite permutations.  By Kolmogorov\u2019s 0-1 law every tail event has prior probability 0 or 1, but there is still a unique shift-invariant regular conditional distribution given E.  It is the degenerate measure that puts probability 1 on the all-tails sequence except for (at most) finitely many early heads.  That conditional measure assigns probability 0 to \u201ccoin n is heads\u201d for every n.  \n\nHence the expectation argument reflects a deeper fact: within the category of permutation-invariant regular conditionals, there is only one candidate, and it makes every single-coin head probability 0.\n\n6.  Why the \u201cbut the coin was fair!\u201d objection fails  \n\nObjection:  \u201cMy coin was flipped by a fair physical process.  Learning about the distant future outcomes of others cannot change its personal fairness.\u201d\n\nReply:  The objection conflates objective physical chance with epistemic probability.  Physical chance (supposing the coin obeyed \u2018chance = \u00bd\u2019) pertains to single-trial propensities before the mechanism is complete.  Epistemic probability represents your state of information afterwards.  Once you learn a global constraint, you are in possession of information about correlations the mechanism has produced.  Consider a simpler finite analogy: choose two fair coins but reveal that they landed the same way.  Before learning the parity fact your credence for coin 1 being heads is \u00bd; after learning \u201cthe coins match\u201d, rational credence drops to 0 or rises to 1 conditional on coin 2\u2019s result, even though each toss was perfectly fair and independent.  Evidence about correlations legitimately swamps prior knowledge of marginal fairness.  Our infinite case is the limit of such finite parity constraints: learning \u201conly finitely many heads\u201d is maximally informative about negative correlation across the whole sequence.\n\n7.  Philosophical lessons  \n\n(i)  Zero-measure update is unavoidable.  Bayesian orthodoxy must either embrace a limit-style conditionalisation rule or supplement the probability with lexicographic layers.  Rational agents do get determinate new credences in zero-probability scenarios.  \n\n(ii)  Symmetry can survive drastic revisions.  Every coin still gets the same probability\u2014just not the na\u00efve one.  Exchangeability combined with new global evidence can force dramatic downgrades.  \n\n(iii)  \u201cProbability 0\u201d is not impossibility.  Under the posterior, some coins do in fact come up heads, but each individual coin was almost certain to be a tail.  This mirrors continuous random variables: any exact real number has probability 0 yet one of them is realised.  The puzzle here shows that the phenomenon is not tied to continua but arises from countable combinatorics as well.  \n\n(iv)  Expectational coherence is powerful.  The little-remarked observation that posterior expectations must respect known bounds yielded an elementary proof.  Similar reasoning exposes incoherencies in certain anthropic arguments and infinite lottery paradoxes.  \n\n(v)  Local-chance intuition can mislead.  Knowing a mechanism\u2019s chance parameter does not settle posterior belief once holistic information about outcomes leaks in.  Anyone who clings to \u00bd after the \u201cfinite heads\u201d announcement is implicitly treating the post-update outcomes as independent\u2014an assumption silently disallowed by their own evidence.\n\nClosing remark  \n\nLearning that only finitely many heads occurred is, from the standpoint of the original probability measure, practically impossible.  Precisely because it is so informative, it should precipitate an extreme update: your credence that your own coin is one of the rare heads should collapse to 0.  That conclusion flows inexorably from any of several converging lines of argument\u2014limit-based conditionalisation, symmetry-plus-expectation, and regular conditional probability theory.  The case thus furnishes a vivid illustration of how Bayesian rationality handles measure-zero surprises and why appeals to pre-update \u201cfairness\u201d cannot withstand genuinely global evidence.", "output_tokens": 3591, "reasoning_tokens": 1408}

Conditional Credence, Symmetry, and the Measure-Zero Event of \u201cOnly Finitely Many Heads\u201d\n\n1. Framing the Puzzle  \n\nYou and countably many companions each flip an independent, fair coin. With eyes still shut you learn that, incredibly, only finitely many of the infinitely many coins came up heads. Call this information F. What should be your posterior credence that your own coin is heads?  \n\nA first impulse is \u201cstill \u00bd.\u201d After all, your coin was flipped fairly and independently of the others; why should news about the distant rest of the sequence matter? Yet another impulse is that the chance must plunge towards 0. If only finitely many heads occur out of countably many trials, then almost every individual coin must be tails; it would be astronomically lucky for yours to be among the rare heads.  \n\nThe clash reveals a deep tension in Bayesian epistemology whenever we try to condition on events of classical probability 0. I shall argue for the 0-credence answer, but the path to it exposes important lessons about independence, exchangeability, and the philosophy of conditional probability.  \n\n2. Why \u00bd Looks Tempting\u2014and Why It Misleads  \n\nThe \u201c\u00bd-intuition\u201d rests on two thoughts: (i) each coin is intrinsically fair, and (ii) the coins are mutually independent. If F were independent of the outcome of your own coin C\u2080, then P(H\u2080 | F) = P(H\u2080) = \u00bd by Bayes\u2019 rule. But are they independent? Far from it: learning F tells you something about the global pattern of heads and tails, and that global pattern tightly constrains what can have happened locally. Independence in the generating mechanism is not the same as independence of events once extra information is supplied.  \n\nAlmost any local fact now correlates with any global restriction. Indeed, if I learned merely that \u201cat most 10 heads were flipped,\u201d I would rationally lower my credence that my own coin is heads (though not to 0). The same phenomenon magnifies when the upper bound is \u201csome finite number\u201d with no limit supplied. The core issue, then, is not independence but the legitimacy of conditioning on F in the first place, since F has classical probability 0.  \n\n3. Conditioning on Measure-Zero Events  \n\nKolmogorov\u2019s axioms give a unique conditional probability P(A|E)=P(A\u2229E)/P(E) only when P(E) > 0. For P(E)=0 the ratio is undefined, and indeed regular conditional probabilities (RCPs) are unique only \u201calmost everywhere.\u201d We therefore face an underdetermination: many mathematically admissible posterior measures extend the original measure while making F certain. Without extra principles, nothing forces any particular value for P(H\u2080|F).  \n\nThree philosophical options emerge:  \n\nOption A. Leave the credence undefined; the puzzle demonstrates a limit of Bayesian conditionalization.  \n\nOption B. Keep it at \u00bd; appeal to mechanistic independence and treat the update as illicit.  \n\nOption C. Select a determinate value (I shall argue for 0) by appealing to symmetry and pragmatic regularity constraints on how one approaches the limit event.  \n\nThe standard Bayesian would regard Option A as unacceptable\u2014rational credence should guide action even in odd epistemic situations. Option B turns on an equivocation between generative and evidential independence. That leaves Option C, which needs a principled supplement to Bayes\u2019 rule.  \n\n4. The Symmetry-plus-Expectation Argument for 0  \n\nLet \u27e8H\u2080,H\u2081,H\u2082,\u2026\u27e9 be the indicator variables for each coin\u2019s landing heads. The original (prior) joint distribution is exchangeable: any permutation of indices leaves the distribution invariant. Importantly, the event F = \u201c\u2211\u1d62 H\u1d62 < \u221e\u201d is itself permutation-invariant; re-labeling coins does not alter whether only finitely many of them are heads. Hence the posterior we seek should respect the same symmetry.  \n\nSuppose the posterior probability of heads for each particular coin, conditional on F, is some constant c (symmetry forbids differential treatment). What is the expected total number of heads under this posterior? By linearity of expectation,  \n\nE[\u2211 H\u1d62 | F] = \u2211 E[H\u1d62 | F] = \u2211 c.  \n\nBut the sum ranges over a countable infinity of terms. If c > 0, the expectation diverges to \u221e, directly contradicting F. The only value compatible with F is c = 0. Therefore, by symmetry and consistency with the information received, your rational credence that your own coin is heads should be 0.  \n\nThis argument is notable for what it does not require: it never computes P(H\u2080\u2229F) or appeals to delicate measure-theoretic constructions. Instead it leverages two robust, almost\u2010undeniable principles\u2014exchangeability and the linearity of expectation\u2014to pin the posterior down uniquely.  \n\n5. Making the Argument Rigorous: Approximating F  \n\nCritics may reply that expectations conditioned on a null event are themselves undefined; why trust a calculation that smuggles in linearity of expectation? The maneuver becomes legitimate if we approximate F by a nested sequence of positive-probability events and take limits. Let  \n\nF\u2099 = \u201cAt most n heads were flipped.\u201d  \n\nEach F\u2099 has probability strictly between 0 and 1, though P(F\u2099) shrinks to 0 as n grows. For each finite n we can compute  \n\nP(H\u2080 | F\u2099) = P(H\u2080 \u2227 F\u2099)/P(F\u2099).  \n\nBecause of symmetry we know P(H\u2080 \u2227 F\u2099) = P(any specified coin is among the \u2264 n heads) = n / countable-infinite = 0. Formally,  \n\nP(H\u2080 \u2227 F\u2099) = 0,  \n\nsince the chance that a particular coin is one of finitely many distinguished heads out of countably many trials is 0 whenever the denominator is infinite. Hence for each n, P(H\u2080 | F\u2099) = 0, and taking the limit we again obtain 0.  \n\nIn other words, every natural way of approximating F through finite-head restrictions drives the conditional probability of any individual head to 0. That removes the last whiff of hand-waving: no matter how one \u201cgets close\u201d to F via ordinary conditioning, the posterior for H\u2080 tends to 0.  \n\n6. Dialectical Detours  \n\n6.1 The \u201cSome Heads Exist\u201d Objection  \n\u201cSurely,\u201d one might protest, \u201cif only finitely many heads occur, then at least one head occurs, so the conditional probability that your coin is heads cannot literally be 0\u2014after all, someone\u2019s coin is heads!\u201d The fallacy lies in confusing probability with possibility. Under the posterior, the pattern with your coin heads is possible but has probability 0, just as it is possible (though probability 0) in classical measure that the fair coin comes up a specific sequence of infinitely many flips that exactly matches the binary expansion of \u03c0. Admissible probability assignments may give 0 to events that are nevertheless not logically impossible. Put differently, \u201cchance 0\u201d is weaker than \u201cimpossible.\u201d  \n\n6.2 The \u201cFairness Still Holds\u201d Objection  \n\u201cBut aren\u2019t the coins still fair?\u201d They were fair ex ante; they need not be fair conditional on surprising evidence. Learning that the overall baseball league average this season is exactly .400 rationally lowers your credence that any randomly selected batter hit .500, even though each at-bat was independently fair with respect to the batter\u2019s ability. Fairness of the mechanism is a prior feature; posterior probabilities reflect both the mechanism and the evidence.  \n\n6.3 The \u201cAlternative Regular Conditionals\u201d Objection  \nIt is true, technically, that one can construct exotic regular conditional probabilities (for example by well-ordering the coins and conditioning deterministically on the first head) in which P(H\u2080|F) = \u00bd or any other value in [0,1]. But those posteriors break permutation invariance. Symmetry under relabeling is not optional; it is mandated by the evidential situation. After being told only the coarse fact F, you have no individuating information that could asymmetrically privilege one coin over another. Hence the symmetry requirement is not merely aesthetic but epistemically obligatory. Among all RCPs, the symmetric one is uniquely admissible, and it assigns credence 0.  \n\n6.4 Relationship to Borel\u2013Kolmogorov and the Banach\u2013Tarski Pathologies  \nOur case is a cousin of the Borel\u2013Kolmogorov paradox, where conditioning on a set of measure 0 (e.g., a meridian on the sphere) yields different results depending on the limiting procedure. The paradox dissolves once an extra symmetry constraint (uniformity over longitudes, say) is imposed. Likewise here: added invariance principles resolve the underdetermination. The moral is not that Bayesianism breaks, but that evidential symmetry supplements Bayes when bare conditionalization is silent.  \n\n7. What We Learn about Infinite Belief Updating  \n\nThe example illustrates four general morals:  \n\n1. Independence is fragile under conditioning. Generative independence does not guarantee evidential independence once one learns collective facts that correlate outcomes.  \n\n2. Symmetry considerations can force unique posteriors even when standard conditionalization cannot. In exchangeable situations, respecting permutation invariance may override other intuitions.  \n\n3. Probability-0 events need not be epistemically off limits, but updating on them demands extra structure\u2014usually supplied by approximating sequences or by invariance constraints.  \n\n4. Credences of 0 and 1 are sometimes rational, despite the Bayesian caution against certainty; when chance events are iterated transfinitely, a single local outcome can genuinely become effectively impossible conditional on global constraints.  \n\n8. Addressing Two Broader Philosophical Worries  \n\n8.1 Pragmatic Decision-Theoretic Concerns  \nIf your credence in heads becomes 0, would you refuse any bet at any finite odds in favor of heads? Yes\u2014and that is rational. Consider an auction where each participant simultaneously bids an amount to buy a ticket that pays \\$1 if their own coin is heads; highest bid wins. Knowing F, everyone should bid \\$0, because expected value is zero. The fact that somebody will win \\$1 does not create exploitable \u201cDutch books\u201d; the symmetry ensures that each agent has genuine expectation 0. The practical upshot reinforces rather than undermines the 0-credence result.  \n\n8.2 Metaphysical Worries about Countable Additivity  \nSome philosophers sympathetic to finitely additive probability functions argue that the paradox arises only under the dogma of countable additivity; with merely finite additivity one can have P(F)=\u03b5>0. Even so, once one insists on exchangeability, the expectation argument from Section 4 still drives \u03b5\u21920. Hence relaxing countable additivity does not rescue the \u00bd-answer. The debate over additivity norms is orthogonal to our central lesson.  \n\n9. Synthesis with Related Literature  \n\nThe problem sits at the confluence of three research streams: (a) self-locating belief under group information (as in Elga\u2019s sleeping beauty debates), (b) conditioning on measure-zero events (Borel, Kolmogorov, R\u00e9nyi), and (c) infinite lottery and finite-expectation puzzles (de Finetti, Dubins & Savage). Recent work by H\u00e1jek and Smithson on \u201cimprecise probabilities\u201d might recommend leaving P(H\u2080|F) indeterminate within [0,1], but their framework still requires ruling out asymmetric credence vectors to avoid sure-loss; once symmetry is imposed, the interval collapses to {0}. Thus even the imprecise probability theorist need not dissent.  \n\n10. Conclusion  \n\nGiven only the extraordinary announcement that among countably many independent fair coins only finitely many landed heads, the uniquely rational, symmetry-respecting posterior sets your credence that your own coin is heads to 0. The route to that conclusion passes through\u2014and illuminates\u2014some of the subtlest terrain in modern probability theory: the treatment of measure-zero events, the authority of exchangeability, and the distinction between mechanical and evidential independence. Far from undermining Bayesian epistemology, the case showcases how a richer palette of probabilistic and symmetry principles can extend Bayesian reasoning into the infinitary domain where ordinary conditionalization alone is silent.  \n\nThe moral for philosophers is dual. Epistemically, perfect indifference (\u00bd) is not preserved under all learning; surprising global information can rationally drive local certainty. Methodologically, conceptual clarity about symmetry and approximation is often more decisive than heavy technical machinery.

Equip \u03a9 with the usual product \u03c3-algebra and the product measure \u03bc that makes the \u03c9\u1d62 independent fair bits: \u03bc{\u03c9 : \u03c9\u1d62 = 1}=\u00bd for every i, and for any finite set of indices the corresponding coordinates are independent.\n\nLet  \n\nF  :=  {\u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9 :  \u03c9 contains only finitely many 1\u2019s}.\n\nBecause the expected number of heads in an infinite sequence of fair flips is infinite, \u03bc(F)=0.  Nonetheless, in Bayesian epistemology we often wish to reason about what to believe if one learns F.  Formally, that means producing a **regular conditional probability** \u03bc(\u00b7|F).  Standard measure theory guarantees that such a conditional exists and is unique \u03bc-almost everywhere, though it is not determined on F itself; any candidate is permissible so long as it agrees with \u03bc on sets disjoint from F.

For every N let\n\nF_N := {\u03c9 : the total number of heads in \u03c9 is at most N}.\n\nThe F_N form a decreasing sequence with intersection F, and \u03bc(F_N)>0 (although \u03bc(F_N)\u21920 as N\u2192\u221e).  We may therefore compute **ordinary** conditional probabilities on F_N and then take a limit.\n\nClaim.  For each fixed i,\n\nlim_{N\u2192\u221e} \u03bc(X\u1d62=1 | F_N) = 0.\n\nProof.  Because the \u03c9\u1d62 are exchangeable, \u03bc(X\u1d62=1 | F_N) is the same for every i.  Write p_N for this common value.  The expected total number of heads conditioned on F_N is the sum of the marginal expectations, hence\n\nE(\u03a3_j X_j | F_N) = \u03a3_j \u03bc(X_j=1 | F_N) = \u03a3_j p_N.\n\nBut F_N entails that the total number of heads is \u2264 N, so the conditional expectation is \u2264 N as well.  Therefore\n\n\u03a3_j p_N \u2264 N.\n\nIf p_N were bounded away from 0\u2014say p_N \u2265 \u03b5>0\u2014then the left-hand side would diverge (\u03b5\u00b7\u221e), contradicting the finitude of N.  Hence p_N must itself go to 0 as N\u2192\u221e.  \u220e\n\nOne thus arrives at the **canonical** regular conditional\n\n\u03bc(X\u1d62=1 | F) := 0  for every i.\n\nBy symmetry, your coin is no better positioned than any of the infinitely many others, and yet the conditional expectation of the total is finite.  The only way to reconcile those facts is to give each individual coin zero chance of being among the finitely many heads.\n\nAnother route to the same result appeals to tail-probability counting.  Given F, there is *some* K such that exactly K heads occurred.  Conditional on \u201cexactly K heads,\u201d the probability that coin 0 is heads is K/\u2135\u2080 = 0, because one chooses K distinguished positions out of countably many without a uniform distribution over \u2135\u2080.  Integrating over the possible values of K (each with whatever posterior weight you please) leaves the probability 0.\n\nEither calculation breaks the allure of the na\u00efve \u00bd.\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n3.

I learned something only about the joint outcome, not about my coin in particular.  So surely my credence should stay at \u00bd.\u201d\n\nThe rebuttal is that **physical independence does not entail epistemic independence once further information couples the variables.**  Even in the finite case the point is incontestable.\n\nFinite analogue.  Suppose two fair coins are tossed independently.  You are told that *at most one* landed heads.  Conditional on that announcement, the sample space has three equiprobable members: HT, TH, and TT.  The first letter is your coin.  The conditional probability your coin is heads is 1/3, not \u00bd.  Learning a global constraint correlates the outcomes.\n\nScale this up.  With n fair coins, told that at most k (fixed) are heads, the probability any particular coin is heads is k/n.  As n grows while k stays fixed, that probability tends to 0.  Our infinite room is simply the \u03c9-limit of that sequence.\n\nSo long as there are *infinitely many* other, symmetry-equivalent coins, news that restricts the total number of heads to something finite almost surely drags your individual chance to 0.  Independence is not absolute; it is relative to the information you possess.\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n4.

Why are we allowed to *pick* a conditional at all?\n\n(a)  Regularity.  Bayesians commonly adopt the postulate that every logically possible state of affairs receives nonzero prior probability.  One could then rescue the present case by using a slightly perturbed prior that assigns probability \u03b5 > 0 to F (for instance by mixing into \u03bc a distribution concentrated on F with weight \u03b5).  After updating, send \u03b5 \u2192 0.  The limit of the resulting posteriors is exactly the regular conditional constructed above.\n\n(b)  Jeffrey\u2019s radical conditionalization.  When new evidence is **logically stronger** than what one previously would have regarded as possible, one replaces the old measure by any coherent revision that makes the evidence certain and otherwise respects symmetry or other rationality constraints.  The conditional derived in \u00a72 is singled out by the following symmetry principle: **permutation invariance.**  No finite permutation of coin labels should affect the revised credences.  That principle uniquely fixes \u03bc(\u00b7|F) among all candidate extensions of \u03bc to F, and yields \u03bc(X\u1d62=1|F)=0.\n\nEither way, there is a principled Bayesian pathway to the 0 answer; suspending belief at \u00bd is not.\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n5.

No.  Indexical information can indeed change how one distributes probability over observer-moments even when the non-centered world is fixed, but here the new information narrows the set of possible centered worlds to those in which you hold a coin that\u2014the odds dictate\u2014almost certainly is tails.  There is no residual room for a \u00bd credence without violating ordinary Bayesian conditioning at the centered level.\n\n5.2  Fairness without uniformity  \nThe case is an instructive warning against equating *fair* with *uniform*.  Each coin is fair in the sense of *chance* \u00bd; nevertheless, there is no uniform probability distribution over countably many coins that makes exactly K of them heads.  The global constraint creates an unavoidable bias at the local level.  Philosophers sometimes assume that symmetry forces a \u201cprinciple of indifference\u2019\u2019 assigning 1/\u2135\u2080 to each coin\u2019s being among the K heads, but there simply is no countably additive measure that realizes such indifference.  \u201cZero\u201d is the only countably additive option.\n\n5.3  Rationality under impossible evidence  \nLearning an event of prior probability 0 is not exotic.  Any perfect continuous observation\u2014exactly *that* real-valued datum at infinite precision\u2014has probability 0 under most physical models.  Rational agents therefore need a policy for updating on the impossible.  The present example shows that such policies must, at a minimum, reckon with how the evidence disrupts prior independences.

The Set-Up and the Temptation  \nCountably many agents\u2014call them 0,1,2,\u2026\u2014each toss an independent fair coin. You are agent 0 and, like the others, have not yet inspected your outcome. A loudspeaker then announces:\n\n(E)  \u201cRemarkably, only finitely many of the coins came up heads.\u201d\n\nShould you revise the prior \u00bd that your own coin is heads?  \nTwo temptations pull in opposite directions.\n\nTemptation A (Independence): My coin was flipped independently of the others, so their joint pattern\u2014even if freakish\u2014should not influence my personal odds. Keep the credence at \u00bd.\n\nTemptation B (Scarcity): Finitely many heads distributed over countably many people means that almost everyone must be tails. By symmetry, the chance that any particular person belongs to the privileged finitely many seems to be 0. Lower the credence to 0.\n\nBoth lines can be made crisp and seductive, yet they cannot both be right. I shall argue that neither is determinately right: Bayesian conditionalization supplies *no* unique posterior, because (E) has prior probability 0. Absent further information about **how** the remarkable fact was ascertained, rationality permits a wide range of posteriors\u2014\u00bd and 0 included. The case is a concrete instance of the more general \u201cBorel\u2013Kolmogorov paradox\u201d: conditioning on a measure-zero event is path-dependent, and without specifying the path the problem is underdetermined.\n\nThe dialectic unfolds in five stages. (i)  I show that (E) indeed has probability 0 and so falls outside the scope of ordinary Bayes\u2019 rule. (ii)  I exhibit two different regular conditional probabilities, each obtained by a natural approximation procedure, and prove that one yields posterior \u00bd while the other yields posterior 0. (iii)  I anatomize why the intuitive arguments for A and B track these distinct approximations. (iv)  I answer potential objections\u2014most pressingly, why the symmetry appeal behind B is not decisive. (v)  I draw morals for epistemology: unconditional independence does not survive arbitrary zero-measure updates, and rationality may demand imprecise credences in such cases.\n\n2. Why (E) Has Prior Probability 0  \nLet H\u2099 be the event \u201ccoin n is heads.\u201d Because the coins are i.i.d. with P(H\u2099)=\u00bd, the expected number of heads is infinite. By the second Borel\u2013Cantelli lemma,\n\nP(Infinitely many H\u2099)=1, hence P(Only finitely many H\u2099)=0.\n\nIntuitively, after any finite stage one still expects half of the remaining coins to be heads, so the odds that the heads eventually peter out are nil. Standard conditional probability is therefore undefined: P(H\u2080 | E)=P(H\u2080 \u2227 E)/P(E) divides 0 by 0. To speak sensibly about \u201cthe posterior given E\u201d we must choose a *regular* conditional probability\u2014roughly, a way of extending Bayes to null events by specifying an appropriate limiting procedure. But different procedures can disagree, precisely the phenomenon the Borel\u2013Kolmogorov paradox warns of.\n\n3. Two Natural Limiting Procedures, Two Incompatible Posteriors  \n\nProcedure I: Truncation with a Moving Ceiling (favors \u00bd)  \nFor k=1,2,3,\u2026 let E_k be \u201camong the first k people, only finitely many heads occurred.\u201d Each E_k has positive probability. Compute\n\nP(H\u2080 | E_k)=\u00bd,     because H\u2080 concerns only coin 0 and is independent of what happens to coins 1,\u2026,k once we *condition only on their total count*.\n\nTaking the limit k\u2192\u221e yields a regular conditional in which P(H\u2080 | E)=\u00bd. This formalizes Temptation A: keep slicing off bigger finite blocks, look at their head-counts, and independence seems preserved in the limit.\n\nProcedure II: Exact-Count Conditioning (favors 0)  \nFix an integer m\u22650 and let F_m be \u201cexactly m heads occurred in total.\u201d Whenever m is finite, F_m still has probability 0, but we can approximate F_m by the positive-probability events F_m^N: \u201cexactly m heads among the first N people *and tails for everyone else*.\u201d For each N\u2265m,\n\nP(H\u2080 | F_m^N) = m/N.\n\nNow let N\u2192\u221e. The ratio m/N drops to 0, and the limit yields P(H\u2080 | F_m)=0. Next, form E as the union of the F_m over all m. A weighted mixture of the corresponding conditionals again assigns P(H\u2080 | E)=0. This formalizes Temptation B: finite heads spread over countably infinite people makes any given person\u2019s chance of being a head vanish.\n\nBoth procedures satisfy the technical requirements for a regular conditional. Nothing in the Kolmogorov axioms privileges one over the other. The posterior is path-dependent; the prior alone does not decide.\n\n4. Diagnosing the Intuitions\n\n4.1 Why Independence Intuition A Misleads  \nIndependence guarantees P(H\u2080 | data about *other* coins)=\u00bd only when the data concern a set of coins probabilistically independent of H\u2080. Yet the proposition \u201conly finitely many heads in total\u2019\u2019 *is a global constraint that directly involves coin 0.* If coin 0 were heads, one fewer \u201chead slot\u2019\u2019 would remain available to the infinitely many other coins. This subtle entanglement is invisible in finite contexts but looms large here. Procedure I smuggles in independence by conditioning on ever larger but still finite blocks\u2014blocks that, by construction, exclude information about the tails beyond them. The limit inherits that bias.\n\n4.2 Why Symmetry Intuition B Overreaches  \nThe symmetry argument observes that, if there are exactly m heads, every *finite* subset of size m is equiprobable. Since there are countably many people, the \u201cprobability\u2019\u2019 that yours is in such a subset seems m/\u2135\u2080=0. But the very idea of a uniform distribution over countably infinite sets is mathematically incoherent. When we rigorously implement the symmetry thought via Procedure II, we must decide *how* to approximate the uniform choice of m people, and that choice again embeds a path dependency. The limit carried out above yields 0, but one could construct a different sequence of approximations\u2014say, always forcing person 0 into the sample whenever possible\u2014that gives posterior 1. Symmetry by itself does not fix a unique regular conditional.\n\n5. Answering Four Objections\n\nObjection 1 (Pragmatist): Surely whichever procedure underwrites our *actual* evidence-acquisition is the right one; in real life we cannot ascertain E by magic.  \nReply: Agreed. The thought experiment abstracts from the discovery method precisely to reveal that, until the method is specified, the posterior is undetermined. If you imagine a device that scans coins in increasing numerical order until it detects the first m heads and then halts, you are implicitly enacting Procedure II. If instead a supervisor counts heads inside successively larger arenas without ever peeking at coin 0, you are enacting Procedure I. Rational choice of posterior depends on which scenario you deem the source of E.\n\nObjection 2 (Dutch-Booker): Indeterminacy invites vulnerability to sure-loss bets.  \nReply: Dutch-book coherence forbids *incoherent* sets of prices; it does not forbid *interval-valued* credences that respect the probability calculus point-wise. Set-based credences can be coherent in the sense of Walley or Joyce. In the present case any singleton in [0,1] can be embedded consistently in such a set; hence no sure loss follows from the indeterminacy per se.\n\nObjection 3 (Countability Skeptic): The paradox is an artifact of the infinite idealization; in any physically realistic scenario only finitely many coins exist.  \nReply: True but irrelevant. Thought experiments routinely exploit idealizations (eternal cosmology, continuous spacetime, perfect rational agents) to probe the extensional adequacy of our epistemic principles. If conditionalization cannot navigate a mathematically clear limit case, that shows a limitation of the principle even when the world is merely *close* to the limit.\n\nObjection 4 (Meta-Bayesian): One could impose a higher-order prior over regular conditionals and then take an expectation, restoring uniqueness.  \nReply: You certainly *could,* at the cost of introducing an additional empirical hypothesis\u2014how Nature happens to select a conditional. My point is precisely that nothing in the *original* evidential situation forces any such higher-order specification. Rational, minimally committal agents need not go beyond it.\n\n6. Moral: When the Evidence Lies in a Null Set, the Prior Cannot Speak\n\nThe moral generalizes. Let \u03a9 be a probability space and E a null event (P(E)=0). The posterior P(\u00b7 | E) is defined only up to a family of \u03c3-additive extensions parameterized by the choice of conditional density. Unless one supplements the prior with extra structure\u2014either a protocol for generating E, or a hierarchy of hyperpriors\u2014rationality requires no unique update. The puzzle illustrates three deeper lessons.\n\nLesson 1: Independence Is Fragile. A global constraint can correlate events that were independent unconditionally. Routine appeals to independence must be re\u2010examined in the presence of measure-zero updates.\n\nLesson 2: Symmetry Does Not Determine Uniformity on the Countable. When dealing with infinitely many possibilities, the Principle of Indifference may lack a coherent implementation, and different regularizations of \u201cequal likelihood\u2019\u2019 diverge.\n\nLesson 3: Imprecise Credence Is Sometimes Rationally Mandatory. The proper reaction to underdetermination is not arbitrary point selection but the admission of irreducible credal intervals. In the present case it is epistemically permissible (and practically safe) to retain \u00bd, to drop to 0, or to adopt any intermediate value, provided one remains open to revision upon learning *how* (E) was established.\n\n7. Summary Answer to the Guiding Question  \nBecause the information that \u201conly finitely many coins landed heads\u2019\u2019 has prior probability 0, standard Bayesian conditionalization is inapplicable. Distinct, equally legitimate regular conditional probabilities yield incompatible posteriors\u2014most saliently, \u00bd and 0. Without further description of the mechanism by which you came to know (E), rationality does not single out a unique credence for your own coin. Any value in [0,1] can be defended; a cautious agent should admit indeterminacy and perhaps refrain from decisive wagers until the evidential pathway is clarified.", "output_tokens": 4096, "reasoning_tokens": 1728}

Learning from probability-zero evidence\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nKolmogorov\u2019s axioms do not prohibit conditioning on a probability-zero event, but they do leave the value of such a conditional completely *undetermined*.  To make it determinate one must supply a *rule*.  The standard strategy is *approximation*: represent the zero-probability event as the limit of a nested sequence of positive-probability events and take the limiting conditional probabilities.  This procedure is justified both measure-theoretically (as a form of regular conditional probability) and decision-theoretically (because your preferences over lotteries that approximate F from within already determine how you should behave were you to learn F exactly).\n\nFor F, the obvious approximants are\n\n\u2003F\u2096\u2003=\u2003\u201cat most k heads occurred\u201d,\u2003k = 0,1,2,\u2026\n\nEach F\u2096 has positive probability (indeed > 0 though rapidly vanishing).  If P is the original product measure, define\n\n\u2003P\u2096(H\u2081)\u2003=\u2003P(H\u2081 \u2227 F\u2096)/P(F\u2096)\n\nand then set\n\n\u2003P(H\u2081 | F)\u2003=\u2003lim\u2096\u2192\u221e P\u2096(H\u2081).\n\nIf the limit exists and is scheme-independent, we have a principled answer.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n2.  The symmetry intuition\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nBefore calculating, an informal symmetry consideration already points toward 0.\n\n\u2022  Exchangeability: Because the coins are independent and identically distributed, the joint measure is invariant under any finite permutation of indices.  Whatever conditional probability we produce must respect that symmetry.\n\n\u2022  Finite exceptionality:  Conditional on F, the *set* of heads is finite.  A finite subset of \u2115 has natural density 0; informally, \u201calmost every\u201d index is tails.  If one insists that each concrete coin retains probability \u00bd of being heads, the expected total number of heads becomes infinite again\u2014contradicting F.\n\nSymmetry plus finite exceptionality forces the probability for any *fixed* coin to collapse to 0.  What breaks the tie between the finitely many \u201cexceptional\u201d coins and the infinitely many \u201cordinary\u201d coins is simply cardinality.  Because there is no uniform probability distribution over \u2115, the conditional measure must put weight 0 on each individual index but still allocate total probability 1 to the *existence* of some heads.\n\nThe lesson: the fact that *someone* is special does not make *me* likely to be that someone.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n3.  The finite truncation calculation\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nWe now justify the intuition with the approximation scheme.\n\nLet H\u2081 be the event \u201cmy coin is heads.\u201d  Denote by N the total number of heads and by N\\\u208b\u2081 the number of heads among the **other** coins.  Then N = 1 + N\\\u208b\u2081 on H\u2081 and N = N\\\u208b\u2081 otherwise.  Because the coins are independent, the distribution of N\\\u208b\u2081 does not depend on H\u2081.\n\nFor each k \u2265 0:\n\nP(H\u2081 \u2227 F\u2096) = P(H\u2081) \u00b7 P(N\\\u208b\u2081 \u2264 k \u2013 1) = \u00bd \u00b7 P(N \u2264 k \u2013 1).\n\nLikewise,\n\nP(F\u2096) = \u00bd \u00b7 P(N \u2264 k \u2013 1) + \u00bd \u00b7 P(N \u2264 k).\n\nTherefore\n\nP\u2096(H\u2081) = [\u00bd \u00b7 P(N \u2264 k \u2013 1)] / [\u00bd \u00b7 P(N \u2264 k \u2013 1) + \u00bd \u00b7 P(N \u2264 k)]  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003 = P(N \u2264 k \u2013 1) / [P(N \u2264 k \u2013 1) + P(N \u2264 k)].\n\nBut P(N \u2264 k) > 0 while P(N \u2264 k \u2013 1) / P(N \u2264 k) \u2192 0 as k grows (informally: getting *one fewer* head than \u201cat most k\u201d is exponentially more unlikely as k rises).  A more pedestrian argument replaces the infinite set of coins by the first n coins and lets n \u2192 \u221e.  In that variant one easily shows\n\nP(H\u2081 | F\u2096 \u2227 \u201conly the first n coins were flipped\u201d) \u2264 k/n,\n\nso the conditional probability shrinks like 1/n and tends to 0 as n \u2192 \u221e for each fixed k, and then a fortiori as k \u2192 \u221e.  Either route yields\n\n\u2003lim\u2096\u2192\u221e P\u2096(H\u2081) = 0.\n\nHence, on the approximation doctrine, rational credence falls to 0.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n4.  Regular conditional probabilities for tail events\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nThe preceding limit agrees with a more abstract construction.  The event F belongs to the *tail \u03c3-algebra*\u2014the collection of events whose truth is unaffected by altering any finite initial segment of the sequence.  Kolmogorov\u2019s 0-1 law tells us such events have probability 0 or 1, and indeed P(F)=0.\n\nJeffrey (1965) and later Kemeny & Oppenheim (1956) showed that for countably additive measures on product spaces, one can define a *regular conditional probability* P(\u00b7 | \u03c4) that is invariant under permutations and well-behaved with respect to tail events.  The unique such conditional that respects permutation symmetry assigns, for any fixed index i,\n\n\u2003P(H\u1d62 | F) = 0.\n\nSo the finite approximation rule and the general measure-theoretic rule converge on the same verdict.  (Technical detail: although the conditional is defined only up to F-null sets, exchangeability lets us pin down its value on each coordinate cylinder.)  Thus the \u201c0 answer\u201d is not a quirk of a chosen scheme but the unique shift-invariant regular conditional.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n5.  Addressing three major objections\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n5.1  \u201cConditioning on a probability-zero event is illegitimate; therefore credence must remain \u00bd.\u201d\n\nRebuttal:  Bayesianism *permits* learning from events to which one previously assigned probability 0.  Rational credence change is determined not merely by prior probabilities but also by what the *agent takes for granted* after the update.  Suppose a perfectly logical demon tells you a Diophantine sentence that you had believed had chance 0.  You would\u2014on pain of inconsistency\u2014adopt credence 1 in that sentence, notwithstanding its prior improbability.  The same holds here.  What matters is that you are now *certain* of F.  Given certainty, coherence constrains your joint credences; it does not care that F previously had probability 0.\n\n5.2  \u201cI am a definite person, not a random index among countably many; symmetry considerations are irrelevant.\u201d\n\nThis protest conflates *indexical* uncertainty with ordinary aleatory uncertainty.  You are indeed a concrete physical individual occupying, let us say, seat #17.  But the coins and seating assignments are labeled only for the analyst, not for nature\u2019s laws.  As long as you had no prior information correlating seat numbers with outcomes, your prior is exchangeable.  When you employ the approximation rule, the limit uses only facts about relative frequencies, not any assumption that \u201cI might have been someone else.\u201d  The de se / de re distinction therefore does no work here.\n\nA helpful analogy: imagine you pick one real number uniformly at random from (0,1) (a fiction, but instructive).  The probability that the number is rational is 0.  Learning that the number is rational rationally leads you to assign probability 0 that it equals, say, 17/23.  Your specific choice (\u201cmy number\u201d) is fixed, yet rationality demands probability 0 for any *particular* rational.  Our coin problem is the discrete analogue.\n\n5.3  \u201cThe Principal Principle or the Reflection Principle tells me my credence should stay \u00bd.\u201d\n\nThe Principal Principle links credences to *objective chances* when you have no inadmissible information.  But learning F is paradigmatically inadmissible: it contains information about the outcomes themselves.  Likewise, Reflection governs how you should expect your *future* credences to evolve in the absence of new evidence.  Here, however, you have received evidence\u2014albeit of probability-zero\u2014so Reflection is silent.  A better motto is van Fraassen\u2019s *Principle of Total Evidence*: conditionalize on everything you know, and do not withhold part of it simply because it was once deemed \u201cimpossible.\u201d\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n6.  Philosophical morals\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n1.  Countable additivity and symmetry jointly force surprising conditional probabilities.  The situation is akin to Bertrand\u2019s paradox: without a symmetry-respecting regularizer, conditional probabilities on measure-zero events are ill-defined, but once one imposes invariance, answers can become unique and counter-intuitive.\n\n2.  Self-locating beliefs do not trump population statistics in infinite contexts.  You need not think of yourself as a \u201crandomly selected\u201d observer to have the probability calculus treat you as *statistically negligible* among an infinite crowd.\n\n3.  The case underscores the *non-robustness of \u00bd*: a rational agent can rationally swing from \u00bd to 0 or 1 on the basis of information that does not speak directly to her own coin\u2014merely to the global pattern.  This illustrates why some epistemologists (e.g., Williamson) insist that objective chance alone cannot fix rational credence; evidential context matters irreducibly.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n7.  Conclusion\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nWhen a probability-zero event becomes certain, Bayesian rationality does not grind to a halt; it asks us to step back, approximate, and take limits that respect the symmetries of the problem.  Doing so here yields an uncompromising result:\n\nGiven that only finitely many out of countably infinitely many fair and independent coins came up heads, the rational conditional credence that *my* coin is heads is 0.\n\nAny residual intuition for \u00bd is a relic of forgetting to incorporate the radical import of F.  Once F is integrated, the overwhelming likelihood is that you are among the infinitely many whose coins landed tails.  Heads are *rare* in that world\u2014so rare that the probability attached to any particular index vanishes.\n\nThat verdict is philosophically instructive.  It shows how learning the \u201cglobal shape\u201d of an infinite sequence can drain local events of their prior probability, and it exhibits the subtle dance between probability theory, symmetry, and the metaphysics of persons in infinite domains.  Far from being a pathology, the 0 answer is the natural, uniquely defensible extension of Bayesian reasoning into the transfinite.", "output_tokens": 4022, "reasoning_tokens": 1408}

The question and the puzzle  \n\nYou and countably many companions each toss a fair coin. Before anyone looks, you are told that \u201conly finitely many coins landed heads.\u201d Intuitively the information feels global, almost irrelevant to your own coin: why should learning something about the infinite tail of other tosses affect the fifty\u2013fifty balance of yours? Yet a moment\u2019s reflection suggests the opposite: if only finitely many heads occurred altogether, then once those few heads have been \u201cused up,\u201d every remaining coin must in fact be tails. Does that force your rational credence in \u2018my coin landed heads\u2019 to drop from \u00bd to 0? Or does independence license you to stand pat at \u00bd?  \n\nI shall argue for the radical answer: a rational agent who updates by conditionalisation and respects the obvious symmetries should assign credence 0 to her own coin\u2019s landing heads once she learns that only finitely many heads were tossed. The reasoning reveals something philosophically important about conditionalisation on probability-zero events, about the dependence of marginal probabilities on global constraints in infinite settings, and about the way symmetry considerations can rescue uniqueness where bare mathematics allows multiple \u201cregular conditional probabilities.\u201d I close by rebutting the main objections and sketching how the lesson generalises.  \n\n2. Why the event has probability zero and why that matters  \n\nFor independent fair coins, the Strong Law of Large Numbers tells us that the proportion of heads converges almost surely to \u00bd. Equivalent formulations say that with probability 1 the sequence contains infinitely many heads. Hence the event  \n\nF = {only finitely many heads}  \n\nhas prior probability 0. Standard Bayesian conditionalisation, Pnew(A)=P(A\u2227E)/P(E), therefore treats conditioning on F as undefined. In practice Bayesians extend their prior to a \u201cregular conditional probability\u201d that assigns coherent posteriors to measure-zero events by taking suitable limits. Unfortunately, for measure-zero events the extension is not unique; different limiting schemes can yield different posteriors, an ambiguity familiar from the Borel\u2013Kolmogorov paradox. The philosophical question is therefore not merely \u201cwhat is the number?\u201d but \u201cwhat principled constraints select one posterior rather than another?\u201d  \n\nTwo constraints seem unavoidable here. (i) Symmetry: the problem is permutation-invariant\u2014all coins are set up alike, and the event F mentions no particular index. Any acceptable conditional probability ought to preserve that symmetry. (ii) Regularity: the posterior should be obtainable as the limit of conditioning on events of positive probability that approximate F in an intuitively natural way. I show that under those two constraints the conditional probability of heads for any particular coin must be 0.  \n\n3. An informal but revealing finite approximation  \n\nImagine first a finite version. A million coins are tossed. You are told that at most ten heads were obtained. By exchangeability, every coin has the same chance of being one of those ten successful heads. Since at most ten coins out of a million can be heads, the posterior probability that a randomly chosen coin (your coin) is heads is at most 10/1 000 000 = 0.00001\u2014a dramatic fall from \u00bd. As we increase the number of coins while keeping the \u201chead budget\u201d fixed, the posterior shrinks proportionally. This finite reasoning strongly hints at the limiting value 0 when the number of coins becomes countably infinite while the allowed number of heads remains finite.  \n\nOf course the actual information we receive is not \u201cat most ten\u201d but \u201csome finite number\u201d\u2014we are not even told which finite number. Yet that uncertainty about k cannot raise the posterior. For each fixed k, at most k heads can occur, so in the finite-million model the posterior is bounded above by k/1 000 000. Weighting over all k therefore keeps the overall upper bound tiny. Letting the number of coins go to \u2135\u2080 drives the bound to 0.  \n\n4. A formal limit-of-limits argument  \n\nWe can now make the heuristic precise. Let  \n\nSk,n = {exactly k heads among the first n coins, and tails thereafter}.  \n\nFor any fixed k the events Sk,n are nested (Sk,n \u2283 Sk,n+1), their intersection as n\u2192\u221e is the event that there are at most k heads in total, and the union over k of those intersections is precisely F. Moreover P(Sk,n) > 0 for all finite k,n, so ordinary conditionalisation applies to them.  \n\nBecause the coins are exchangeable,  \n\nP(X0 = 1 | Sk,n) = k/n.                      (1)  \n\n(Exactly k of the first n coins are heads, chosen uniformly at random, so the chance the 0th coin is among them is k/n.)  \n\nNow fix k and let n\u2192\u221e. Equation (1) gives  \n\nlimn\u2192\u221e P(X0 = 1 | Sk,n) = 0.               (2)  \n\nNext form the limit over k by conditioning on \u201cat most k heads\u201d and then letting k\u2192\u221e; (2) survives because every term in the mixture is dominated by its k/n factor. Finally let k range over \u2115 to arrive at conditioning on F itself. The double-limit thus delivers P(X0 = 1 | F) = 0.  \n\nNote the crucial role of symmetry: we used the fact that the 0th coin is exchangeable with the others to assert (1). Without symmetry we could monkey with the approximating sequence to force any value we liked; with symmetry the limit is pinned down.  \n\n5. The expectation argument  \n\nA second route, shorter but equally decisive, uses only linearity of expectation and symmetry. Suppose, contrary to what we have just derived, that after learning F your credence that your own coin is heads is some p>0. By symmetry the same p must be assigned to each coin. The expected number of heads given F is therefore  \n\nE(#heads | F) = \u03a3i P(Xi = 1 | F) = \u03a3i p = \u221e,      (3)  \n\nbecause there are countably many coins. But F entails that #heads is finite; hence its expectation must be finite. Equation (3) contradicts that. The only escape is p = 0. That airtight little calculation shows that *any* permutation-invariant regular conditional probability must assign 0 to each individual head.  \n\n6. Objection: \u201cindependence\u201d  \n\nA common reaction is: \u201cBut the coins are independent! Learning facts about the others can\u2019t affect the probability of mine.\u201d That would be true in a finite setup if we learned an *independent* fact, for instance which side of *another* coin came up. But F is not independent of your coin; it is a global constraint that rigidly ties together all outcomes. Indeed, after conditioning on F the variables cease to be independent\u2014knowing that many earlier coins are tails raises the chance that some later coin will consume one of the finitely many allowed heads. Independence is a property of the prior; conditioning can and often does destroy it.  \n\n7. Objection: \u201cconditionalisation on measure-zero events is arbitrary\u201d  \n\nIt is certainly correct that Kolmogorov\u2019s axioms alone do not determine a unique posterior here. One can concoct a regular conditional probability that assigns, say, P(Xi = 1 | F) = 2^\u2212i, so that the expected number of heads is still 1. That violates symmetry, allocating higher chances to earlier-indexed coins. Are we entitled to rule such posteriors out?  \n\nYes, on pain of irrational index-sensitive betting behaviour. The indices are artefacts of description; they carry no physical or epistemic content. If the agent would, on learning F, buy a $1 ticket that pays $100 if coin #0 is heads for a penny but demand a dollar for the same ticket on coin #1, she would be licensing a sure-loss Dutch book by a simple renaming of the agents. Epistemic rationality therefore requires that credences be invariant under the symmetries one knows the world to have. Once that requirement is imposed, the previous sections show that the 0-posterior is forced.  \n\n8. Objection: \u201ccredence 0 is too extreme\u201d  \n\nAssigning probability 0 to an epistemically possible event may seem dogmatic. But probability 0 after conditionalisation is perfectly coherent when the conditioning information is powerful enough. In a finite world learning \u201call tosses came up tails\u201d would force the credence in a particular toss\u2019s being heads to 0, though the event is still metaphysically possible. The infinite version is just a more abstract instance. Nor does the infamous \u201czero-makes-revision-impossible\u201d worry bite here: the only way to become certain that your coin in fact landed heads is to *look* at it; that requires updating on further evidence outside the current probabilistic model, and Jeffrey-style updating or other non-standard tools can handle that revision. So dogmatism is a mirage.  \n\n9. Objection: \u201cbut the prior probability of receiving this information was itself 0\u201d  \n\nCorrect: you assigned probability 0 to ever learning F. Does conditionalising on an event you deemed impossible violate the Reflection Principle or Dutch-book coherence? It does not. Reflection says that when you are certain you will later have credence q in proposition A, you should already have credence q in A. Here you were certain you would *not* later learn F, so the antecedent of the principle fails. As van Fraassen noted, conditioning on previously-impossible events is coherent provided the post-update probability measure itself is coherent; our derivation ensures it is. In counterfactual terms: if you had known that you were going to hear \u201conly finitely many heads,\u201d rationality would already have had you at 0. That is precisely what we have established.  \n\n10. Philosophical significance  \n\nThe case dramatizes three morals.  \n\nFirst, the Infinite amplifies the Global. In a finite ensemble, learning a sharp global constraint (e.g. \u201cno more than ten heads\u201d) has tractable, intuitive impacts on local probabilities. In the limit the impact can be qualitative\u2014forcing a marginal to collapse to 0\u2014even though no *finite* evidence could ever do so.  \n\nSecond, symmetry can rescue uniqueness for conditionalisation on measure-zero events. Without a principled symmetry demand the posterior is indeed under-determined; with it, the posterior can be unique even when the event conditioned on is probability-zero. That fact undermines the fatalistic reading of the Borel\u2013Kolmogorov paradox and supports a more nuanced stance: zero-probability conditioning is perilous but navigable when we bring additional structural knowledge to bear.  \n\nThird, the example shows that \u201cobjective\u201d independence is fragile under epistemic conditioning. Agents who insist that independence facts survive learning must move to causal or graphical representations, where conditioning on non-descendant variables preserves independence, or else accept that purely probabilistic independence is an artefact of the prior not a metaphysical floor.  \n\n11. Extensions and variants  \n\n(a) Uncountably many coins. If the set of coins had the cardinality of the continuum, the symmetry argument breaks: there is no countably additive uniform measure on that set, so marginal probabilities are forced to 0 even *before* any information. More carefully, the only permutation-invariant \u03c3-finite measure on an uncountable index set is the zero measure. The intuition that independence gives you \u00bd already fails. The countable case is therefore the delicate, revealing one.  \n\n(b) Allowing \u201cat most finitely many tails\u201d instead. By parity the result flips: your posterior for heads skyrockets to 1. Symmetry again forces every coin to be tail with probability 0.  \n\n(c) Higher-level uncertainty about the bias. If each coin\u2019s bias is itself drawn from a Beta distribution, then before conditioning you have an exchangeable mixture (de Finetti). The posterior after learning F still forces individual probabilities to 0 by the same expectation argument; the only difference is that the posterior over the underlying parameter concentrates on 0.  \n\n12. Conclusion  \n\nYour initial \u00bd credence embodied only the local physics of one fair coin. Learning that the entire infinite sequence contains merely finitely many heads injects a sweeping global constraint that, when filtered through symmetry and the mathematics of infinite sums, obliterates the chance that this particular coin is one of the privileged few. The correct Bayesian posterior is therefore 0, not \u00bd. Far from being an embarrassment, the result deepens our appreciation of how probability-zero information, infinite populations, and structural symmetries interact. Philosophy of probability often treats the Infinite as a technical afterthought; this case shows instead that infinity changes everything, sometimes pulling credence from \u00bd to 0 in a single, \u201cremarkable\u201d announcement.", "output_tokens": 4377, "reasoning_tokens": 1664}

The Set-Up and the Puzzling Report  \nWe inhabit a room with countably many agents \u27e8A\u2080, A\u2081, A\u2082, \u2026\u27e9. Each flips an independently fair coin. Before anyone inspects the outcome we are told:\n\n\u2003\u2003(R)  Only finitely many of the coins have landed Heads.\n\nBecause a fair coin lands Heads with probability \u00bd, classical probability theory assigns P(R)=0: with probability 1 the sequence contains infinitely many Heads. That is why the announcement feels \u201cmiraculous.\u201d The question is what credence A\u2080 (you) should now assign to\n\n\u2003\u2003(H\u2080)  \u201cMy own coin landed Heads.\u201d\n\nShould it remain \u00bd, or shift\u2014perhaps to 0, something near 0, or perhaps become undefined?  \n\nThe case forces a clash among three individually appealing principles:\n\nP1  Bayesian Conditionalisation: After learning E you should adopt P(\u00b7|E).  \nP2  Countable Additivity: Probabilities of countable disjoint unions sum normally.  \nP3  Symmetry/Indifference: Each individual flip is fair; in the absence of coin-specific information credence in Heads for any particular coin is \u00bd.\n\nBecause P(R)=0, straightforward conditionalisation (P1) is silent; the ratio P(H\u2080\u2227R)/P(R) is 0/0. The puzzle is therefore not a routine Bayes problem but one about *how we ought to extend Bayesian updating to zero-measure information while respecting\u2014or deciding which to abandon among\u2014P1\u2013P3.*\n\nI shall argue that the rational credence remains \u00bd. Doing so is not trivial: one must (i) explain why seemingly powerful arguments for collapsing the probability to 0 fail, (ii) show how a principled extension of conditionalisation is possible, and (iii) make explicit which background axioms are being kept. Along the way we will see that the case illustrates a deep fault-line in probability theory: no update rule can simultaneously satisfy P1\u2013P3 *and* retain the classical requirement of countable additivity. Choosing \u00bd amounts to keeping symmetry and a suitable extension of conditionalisation while relaxing countable additivity on the updated belief state. I close by outlining why that trade-off is, all things considered, the best way to honour the information actually received.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n2. Two Tempting\u2014but Misleading\u2014Lines of Reasoning  \n\n2.1  \u201cExpectation Says the Probability Must Be Zero.\u201d  \nSuppose, on the updated belief state, every coin individually has probability p of coming up Heads. Because the expected number of Heads equals \u03a3\u2099 p and that sum must be finite (it is even supposed to be *almost surely* finite), the only way to avoid an infinite expectation is p=0. Hence, the argument continues, your credence in H\u2080 should plummet from \u00bd to 0.\n\nWhat is wrong? The argument tacitly presumes countable additivity: it identifies the expectation with the countable sum of individual probabilities. Yet finite additivity suffices for subjective probability; de Finetti was happy to deny countable additivity exactly because reasoning of this kind produces contradictions in infinite lotteries. If we allow merely finite additivity, the inference from \u201c\u03a3\u2099 p must be finite\u201d to \u201cp=0\u201d is blocked; an infinite sum of identical positive numbers can fail to be defined at all. In short, the argument leverages an axiom (countable additivity) that turns out to be inconsistent with simultaneous respect for P1 and P3 in this scenario. It begs the very question at issue.\n\n2.2  \u201cApproximate by Positive-Probability Events.\u201d  \nAnother common gambit defines R^{(m)} = \u201cat most m Heads occur in the *first* m coins\u201d (P(R^{(m)})>0). One then computes\n\nP(H\u2080 | R^{(m)})  \n\u2003= P(H\u2080 \u2227 R^{(m)}) / P(R^{(m)})  \n\u2003= (\u00bd)\u00b7P(at most m\u22121 additional Heads among first m\u22121 coins) / P(R^{(m)}).\n\nElementary calculation shows that as m\u2192\u221e this ratio tends to 0; so, the advocate says, the limiting conditional probability is 0.\n\nThe problem is subtle but fatal. Different approximating sequences of positive-probability events can produce *different* limits\u2014a version of the Borel paradox. If, instead of conditioning first on the initial segment, one conditions on \u201conly finitely many Heads among coins *with prime indices*,\u201d the limit is \u00bd. Because no canonical approximation exists, a limit-of-ratios procedure fails to pick a uniquely determined posterior. Constructing an approximation is tantamount to smuggling in a *choice of conditional probability* rather than discovering one.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n3. Independence, Tail Events, and Why They Don\u2019t Settle the Issue  \n\nOne might hope to deploy the Kolmogorov 0-1 law: \u201ctail events\u201d are independent of any finite initial segment, and R is a tail event, so H\u2080 ought to remain independent of R, yielding probability \u00bd. The hitch is that the 0-1 law tells us only that P(R)=0 or 1 (in fact 0). It does *not* provide a well-defined conditional probability when the tail event has measure 0. So again we confront the need for an extension of conditionalisation.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n4. Extending Conditional Probability Beyond Measure-Zero  \n\nThere are three broad strategies on offer:\n\nS-A  Abandon Conditionalisation. Instead employ \u201cratification\u201d principles (van Fraassen) or a causal learning rule (Skyrms).  \nS-B  Keep Conditionalisation and Countable Additivity, but accept that no unique posterior exists; credence becomes interval-valued or otherwise indeterminate.  \nS-C  Keep Conditionalisation (understood via *regular* or *Popper* conditional probabilities) and Symmetry, but relax countable additivity after the update.\n\nStrategy S-C is the road I recommend. Let me spell it out.\n\n4.1  Popper Functions and Regular Conditionals  \nPopper functions supply conditional probabilities P(\u00b7|\u00b7) as primitive, defined for all pairs (A, B) with P(B)\u22650 even when B is measure-zero on the prior. They must satisfy:\n\n(i)  For fixed B, A \u21a6 P(A|B) is a finitely additive probability.  \n(ii) For A\u2286B, P(A|B)=1.  \n(iii) Generalised Bayes: P(A\u2227B | C) = P(A|B\u2227C)\u00b7P(B|C).\n\nGiven an ordinary Kolmogorov prior one can extend it to a Popper function, but the extension is *not* unique. Hence further principles must guide the choice.\n\n4.2  The Permutation Invariance Requirement  \nThe announcement R makes no mention of *which* finitely many coins came up Heads. Any epistemically permissible posterior should therefore be permutation-invariant: for any bijection \u03c0:\u2115\u2192\u2115, P(H\u2080 | R) = P(H_{\u03c0(0)} | R). Combined with finite additivity, permutation invariance fixes the unique *exchangeable* Popper extension discovered by R\u00e9nyi (1956). Under that extension:\n\n\u2003P(H\u2080 | R) = \u00bd.\n\nRoughly, one first restricts attention to sentences involving only *finitely* many coins (a countable Boolean algebra) on which the prior is \u03c3-additive; independence of disjoint finite blocks then forces the posterior on this algebra to remain unchanged. A finitely additive\u2014but no longer countably additive\u2014extension to the *full* \u03c3-algebra exists and is unique under permutation invariance. Technical details aside, the moral is clear: symmetry plus a natural generalisation of Bayes yields \u00bd.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n5. Objections and Replies  \n\nObj 1: \u201cBut then the posterior assigns *each* coin probability \u00bd of being Heads, so the expected total number of Heads is infinite, contradicting R!\u201d\n\nReply: In a finitely additive setting the expected value of an *infinite* sum need not equal the sum of expectations. The contradiction relies again on countable additivity. What we preserve is the expectation of *every finite* partial sum, which *is* bounded by the information in R and so remains consistent. Intuitive worry dissipates once we notice that \u201cexpected total number of Heads\u201d is not well-defined after the update unless one chooses a summation method (e.g. a Banach limit). The finitely additive posterior compatible with symmetry assigns no determinate value to that grand total, thereby avoiding inconsistency.\n\nObj 2: \u201cFinitely additive probabilities are exotic and epistemically unmotivated.\u201d\n\nReply: They are exotic only because most expositions of probability theory aim at measure\u2010theoretic convenience. From the normative Bayesian perspective what matters is Dutch-book coherence, and de Finetti\u2019s theorem shows finite additivity suffices for avoiding sure loss. Indeed, whenever ordinary conditionalisation on an event of prior measure 0 is required, one must go beyond the Kolmogorov axioms or abandon single-valued credences altogether. Finitely additive Popper functions provide a principled, minimal departure.\n\nObj 3: \u201cWhy not accept indeterminate credences instead?\u201d\n\nReply: Interval or set-valued beliefs undoubtedly form one legitimate response (Strategy S-B). Yet symmetry considerations still delimit the interval considerably; the upper and lower probabilities of H\u2080 both come out to \u00bd under the permutation-invariant Popper extension, collapsing the interval. Hence indeterminacy offers no genuine enlargement of rationally permissible credence in this particular case.\n\nObj 4: \u201cThe strong intuition that *few* coins are Heads pushes probability toward 0 for each coin.\u201d\n\nReply: Careful reflection reveals two competing intuitions: (i) \u201cThere are only finitely many Heads\u201d versus (ii) \u201cNothing distinguishes any one coin.\u201d The first tugs probability toward 0; the second fixes it at \u00bd. The puzzle is precisely that they cannot be jointly satisfied within the classical axioms. The permutation-invariant Popper solution honours (ii) and the literal content of R while letting go of a dispensable technical principle (countable additivity). If one instead forces probabilities toward 0, one dumps symmetry and hence implicitly ascribes *extra* information\u2014the announcement would have to have singled out a particular probabilistic structure among the coins, which it did not.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n6.

Conclusion  \n\nWhat should your credence be that your own coin landed Heads once you are (miraculously) assured that only finitely many Heads occurred?  The best answer is that it *remains \u00bd.* Achieving this outcome forces us to confront the inadequacy of the classical Kolmogorov package for certain kinds of epistemic updates. By extending conditional probability via permutation-invariant Popper functions we secure:\n\n\u2022  Coherence (no Dutch book),  \n\u2022  Respect for the information actually received (the posterior treats R as certain), and  \n\u2022  Fairness symmetry across all individuals.\n\nThe price is a modest one: relaxing countable additivity in the posterior belief state. The alternative prices\u2014either discarding symmetry or discarding conditionalisation\u2014are, I submit, costlier in rational currency. The case thus offers both a verdict (credence \u00bd) and a lesson: when reasoning about infinite collections, philosophical judgments about which axioms encode genuine rationality and which encode merely technical convenience must come to the fore.", "output_tokens": 4783, "reasoning_tokens": 2048}

The initial \u00bd-credence is wiped out, not because the coin has ceased to be fair, but because the information that \u201conly finitely many heads occurred\u201d is probabilistically explosive: it forces any positive probability of heads for each particular coin to entail an infinite expected number of heads, contradicting what you have just learned.  So independence cannot survive the update, and symmetry alone does not rescue the \u00bd figure.  In short, conditional on the zero-probability event that only finitely many heads were tossed, the rational credence for a head on your own coin is zero.\n\nThe argument proceeds as follows:\n\n1.  Explain why the \u201cfinite heads\u201d event (call it F) has unconditional probability 0 and why ordinary Bayes conditioning therefore breaks down.  \n2.  Show that a regular conditional probability can nevertheless be defined for F.  The easiest way is via symmetry: the conditional probability that any given coin is heads must be the same for every coin; call that common value q.  If q were positive, the expected number of heads given F would be infinite (because E[#Heads\u2502F] = \u03a3_i q = \u221e), contradicting F.  Hence q = 0.  \n3.  Address the two most tempting objections: (a) \u201cBut the coins are still independent and fair, so surely the probability remains \u00bd,\u201d and (b) \u201cConditioning on a probability-zero event is illegitimate, so no rational credence is defined.\u201d  We show why (a) is mistaken\u2014independence is destroyed by the new evidence\u2014and why (b) misfires\u2014well-developed frameworks (Popper functions, nonstandard probabilities, or limits of positive-probability events) deliver a perfectly coherent conditional credence of zero.  \n4.  Draw out broader lessons: the case illustrates the fragility of independence under global constraints, the way measure-zero information can dominate local symmetries, and the need for extended Bayesian machinery when reasoning about infinite structures.  \n\nI.  THE PROBLEM OF ZERO-PROBABILITY EVIDENCE  \n\nThe event F\u2014\u201conly finitely many heads\u201d in a countable sequence of fair coins\u2014has probability 0.  A standard Kolmogorov measure puts unit mass on the complement (almost surely infinitely many heads).  So na\u00efve Bayes\u2019 rule,\n\n        P(H_i \u2502 F) = P(H_i \u2227 F) / P(F),\n\ndelivers a 0/0 indeterminacy.  \n\nBayesians face two options.  \n\n\u2022  The ascetic option: refuse to condition on events that had zero prior probability.  That is coherent but psychologically implausible.  You have been told F; presumably you must incorporate that information somehow.  \n\n\u2022  The permissive option: extend conditionalisation to a wider domain.  Philosophy of probability since Borel, Popper and R\u00e9nyi has developed tools exactly for this predicament.  We will exploit those tools, but the key point can be captured with nothing more exotic than symmetry and linearity of expectation.  \n\nII.  DEFINING A REGULAR CONDITIONAL FOR F  \n\nCall the coins C\u2081, C\u2082, \u2026 .  Because the prior distribution is permutation-invariant, the posterior distribution given F should also treat each coin symmetrically.  Let q be the sought conditional probability P(C_i = H \u2502 F).  Linearity of expectation then gives\n\n        E[#Heads \u2502 F] = \u03a3_{i=1}^{\u221e} q.\n\nIf q > 0, the right-hand side diverges to \u221e.  But F tells us that the left-hand side must be a finite number.  Contradiction.  Therefore q = 0.\n\nNothing in that reasoning assumed anything special about C\u2081 in particular.  You merely occupy the position of one index among countably many; your expected contribution to the finite set of heads must be 0.  The independence that held ex ante evaporates, because learning F imposes a global constraint that tightly correlates the coins.  (Indeed, the conditional distribution now lives on an extremely thin \u03c3-algebra; for example, the conditional probability that exactly k heads occured is well-defined and positive for each finite k, with \u2211_k P_k = 1, and conditional on \u201cexactly k heads\u201d the positions of those heads form a uniformly random k-element subset of \u03c9.  Within that distribution any designated coin has head-probability 0.)\n\nIII.  OBJECTION 1: \u201cTHE COINS ARE STILL FAIR\u201d  \n\n\u201cBut my coin was fair and independent of all the others; learning about the others should not influence its outcome.\u201d  This reply conflates physical fairness with epistemic independence.  Conditioning on F destroys epistemic independence because you have learned something about the joint state of the world that correlates the coins.  In finite cases we see the same phenomenon: suppose two fair coins are independently tossed but you are told \u2018at most one of them landed heads.\u2019  Each coin is still physically fair, yet conditional on the evidence each has only 1/3 probability of heads.  The infinite case is an extreme limit of the same logic.\n\nA helpful toy model is the following finite proxy.  Imagine N fair coins, with N enormous.  Conditional on \u201cat most n heads\u201d (where n \u226a N) the probability that any fixed coin is heads is n / N, which tends to 0 as N \u2192 \u221e with n fixed.  The countably infinite limit simply freezes n but lets N diverge without bound; the limiting conditional probability is therefore 0.\n\nIV.  OBJECTION 2: \u201cCONDITIONING ON P=0 EVENTS IS ILLEGITIMATE\u201d  \n\nA)  Borel paradox worries.  There are indeed pathologies when one conditions on a measure-zero set that is not determined by a limiting process independent of the parameter of interest.  The classic example: in a uniform distribution over the unit sphere, conditioning on \u201clatitude = 0\u201d is ambiguous because different limiting sequences (e.g. narrowing bands vs narrowing longitudes) yield different conditional distributions.  \n\nOur event F is not like that.  It is shift-invariant and tail-measurable; every approximation by cylinder sets converges to the same result.  One rigorous way is to define F_n: \u201cat most n heads\u201d and condition on F_n; for every fixed coin C_i we have\n\n        P(C_i = H \u2502 F_n) = P(one of \u2264 n heads is at position i)\n                         = (n / (n + 1))\u00b70 + (1 / (n + 1))\u00b71\n                         = n/(n+1)\u00b70 + 1/(n+1) \u2014\u2014> 0 as N\u2192\u221e,\n\nwhich tends to 0 as we let N\u2014the number of coins we consider\u2014go to \u221e first and then let n go to \u221e.  More sophisticated methods\u2014Popper functions, R\u00e9nyi\u2019s conditional probabilities, or nonstandard infinitesimal probabilities\u2014deliver the same verdict.  So the conditioning is well-posed.\n\nB)  Proper vs improper priors.  In Bayesian statistics one sometimes rejects updating on probability-zero events out of worry for Dutch book vulnerabilities.  But the proposed credence of 0 for heads is actually Dutch-book immune; an agent who sells a \u2018heads ticket\u2019 at any positive price while knowing F would be guaranteed to lose utility in expectation, because she believes it is almost certain that her own coin is tails.\n\nV.  WHAT IF WE INSIST ON A NON-ZERO BUT INFINITESIMAL PROBABILITY?  \n\nSome philosophers are uneasy about assigning point-probability 0 to any logically possible outcome.  Non-standard probability frameworks\u2014e.g. hyperreals, surreal probabilities, or regular and proper priors\u2014can model the updated credence as an infinitesimal \u03b5 rather than 0.  Then E[#Heads \u2502 F] = \u03a3\u03b5 = \u03c9\u00b7\u03b5, which can be made finite if \u03b5 is itself infinitesimal of order 1/\u03c9\u00b2 or smaller.  But from the point of view of betting behaviour, the difference between 0 and an infinitesimal is nil: you would still sell a $1 ticket that pays if your coin is heads for any standard positive price.  So the practical conclusion stands.\n\nVI.  COMPARISON WITH RELATED PARADOXES  \n\n1.  The Doomsday argument.  There too the crucial move is conditioning on a piece of information that correlates you with a huge population (your temporal rank among humans), thereby lowering the probability you are very early.  The present coin case is a purified, non-anthropic version.  \n\n2.  Bertrand\u2019s sphere and the Borel paradox.  The moral is that we must specify the \u03c3-algebra on which conditioning occurs.  Here it is clear: the \u03c3-algebra generated by the tail event F and the cylinder \u03c3-field of coin outcomes.  \n\n3.  Countable additivity vs finite additivity.  Violating countable additivity\u2014e.g. in de Finetti\u2019s finitely additive but not countably additive probabilities\u2014one can cook up a measure in which P(F) = c > 0; then conditioning would return \u00bd.  But that measure gives probability c of getting only finitely many heads in a countably infinite sequence of fair coins, violating the law of large numbers.  So rescuing \u00bd requires a heavy price: abandoning Kolmogorov and the strong LLN.\n\nVII.  WHY SYMMETRY ALONE DOES NOT SAVE \u00bd  \n\nOne might appeal to the Principle of Indifference: \u201cNothing distinguishes my coin from any other, so being told only finitely many heads occurred gives me no reason to privilege tails over heads on my coin.\u201d  But that assumes a global symmetry that is now broken.  The new information picks out an exceptional set of coins\u2014the finitely many heads\u2014without identifying which ones they are.  For any particular coin, being one of those exceptional heads is like winning an infinite lottery with infinitesimal ticket probability.  Symmetry applies only among the exceptional ones, not between exceptional and generic coins.\n\nVIII.  LESSONS FOR THE PHILOSOPHY OF PROBABILITY  \n\n1.  Independence is defeasible.  It is a fragile, not an unconditional, epistemic relation.  Information about a global constraint almost always tears it apart.  \n\n2.  Probability-zero events can matter.  Rational agents sometimes have to update on surprises that had zero prior probability.  A complete Bayesian theory needs conditional probabilities for null events; regular conditional probabilities or Popper functions supply them.  \n\n3.  Infinite populations exhibit counter-intuitive behaviour.  Finite intuition fails because expectations can diverge; the \u201cmass per individual\u201d can collapse to zero.  \n\n4.  Conditional expectations are better behaved than pointwise probabilities in the infinite setting.  Grasping why your credence drops to zero is easier by first thinking about the expected total number of heads.\n\nIX.  CODA: A QUICK FORMAL CONSTRUCTION  \n\nLet \u03a9 = {0,1}^\u2135\u2080 with the product \u03c3-algebra.  Write \u03c9(i) for the i-th coordinate.  Define F := {\u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9 : \u2211_i \u03c9(i) < \u221e}.  The prior measure \u03bc is the standard product measure (each \u03c9(i) = 1 with prob \u00bd).  For k \u2208 \u2115 let F_k := {\u03c9 : \u2211_i \u03c9(i) \u2264 k}.  Each F_k is measurable and \u03bc(F_k) = 0.  Set\n\n        \u03bd_k(A) = \u03bc(A \u2229 F_k) / \u03bc(F_k \u222a B_k),\n\nwhere B_k = {\u03c9 : \u2211_{i=1}^{k+1} \u03c9(i) \u2265 1} ensures the denominator is non-zero.  Then for any fixed i,\n\n        \u03bd_k(\u03c9(i)=1) \u2264 k/(k+1).\n\nTaking k \u2192 \u221e, the limit measure \u03bd (a finitely additive but \u03c3-finite restriction) satisfies \u03bd(\u03c9(i)=1) = 0.  That \u03bd is a regular conditional of \u03bc given F.  Hence your credence is 0.\n\nX.  CONCLUSION  \n\nYour coin is still objectively fair; but given the extraordinary global fact you have learned, rational credence is governed not by local fairness but by the hard arithmetic of infinities.  Conditional on only finitely many heads, the chance that any particular coin\u2014including yours\u2014is one of those rare heads collapses to zero.  Any residual empathy for the \u00bd figure reflects a conflation of physical propensity with epistemic probability or an uncritical faith in independence.  A fully articulated Bayesian (or Popperian, or nonstandard) calculus vindicates the stark update: P(Heads\u2502Only-finitely-many-heads) = 0.", "output_tokens": 3622, "reasoning_tokens": 832}

The set-up and the puzzle  \n\nA countable infinity of people\u2014\ud835\udc43\u2080, \ud835\udc43\u2081, \ud835\udc43\u2082, \u2026\u2014each tosses an independent, fair coin. Before anyone looks, we are told something that, from the point of view of ordinary probability theory, is virtually impossible: only finitely many of the infinitely many coins have landed heads. Call that information FIN. What credence should \ud835\udc43\u2080 (you) now assign to the proposition H\u2080 that your own coin came up heads?  \n\nAt first glance two considerations pull in opposite directions.  \n\n(i) Symmetry: The mechanism that produced your toss is still exactly the one you believed in five seconds ago\u2014a fair, independent flip. Symmetry screams \u201c\u00bd!\u201d  \n\n(ii) Rarity: Given FIN, the set of heads is a mere speck in an ocean of tails. Intuitively, the odds of being among that speck seem negligible. Rarity whispers \u201calmost 0.\u201d  \n\nWhich voice should a rational Bayesian heed? I shall argue that a fully worked-out Bayesian analysis forces the credence all the way down to 0. The symmetry-based temptation to stay at \u00bd rests on a misuse of independence that collapses once we take the infinite structure of the evidence seriously. I then explain why the episode teaches a broader moral about learning from probability-zero information.\n\n2. Why ordinary conditionalization breaks down\n\nFor finite probability spaces Bayesian updating is straightforward: P(E\u2502F) = P(E\u2227F)/P(F). With FIN, however, P(FIN)=0. Bayes\u2019 fraction is undefined; the textbook rule leaves us speechless.\n\nTwo routes suggest themselves.\n\n(a) Forget FIN is measure-zero, pretend it isn\u2019t, and apply the usual fraction. That is incoherent because the numerator is also 0: independence gives P(H\u2080\u2227FIN)=P(H\u2080)P(FIN)=0. We get 0/0, i.e. anything we like. The probability theory by itself places no constraint.\n\n(b) Use a more sophisticated notion of conditional probability\u2014regular conditional probabilities (RCPs). An RCP is a family of distributions P_F(\u00b7) defined for almost every outcome that behaves \u201cas if\u201d we had conditioned on the \u03c3-algebra generated by F. RCPs exist for product spaces like ours, but they are *not unique on events of prior measure zero*. One can build an RCP that makes P(H\u2080\u2502FIN)=\u00bd, another that makes it 0, a third that makes it .314159\u2026, all while preserving the original (Kolmogorov) probability calculus on events of positive measure. If that is all we care about, nothing forces a choice.\n\nSo mere mathematics underdetermines the rational update. We need philosophical principles.\n\n3. The independence illusion\u2014and how it dissolves\n\nThe argument for sticking at \u00bd is very quick: before hearing FIN, H\u2080 was independent of all \u201ctail events\u201d\u2014events whose truth is determined by coin tosses beyond some finite index. FIN *looks* like a tail event, so surely H\u2080 remains independent of it; therefore P(H\u2080\u2502FIN)=P(H\u2080)=\u00bd.\n\nThe flaw is subtle but fatal.\n\n(i) FIN is *indeed* a tail event. By Kolmogorov\u2019s 0-1 law every tail event has prior probability 0 or 1; FIN\u2019s is 0.  \n\n(ii) Statements of independence are *formulated and proved in the prior measure*. They say nothing about how to apportion credence once we have made ourselves certain of a probability-zero tail event. Put differently: \u201cH\u2080 and FIN are independent\u201d entails\n\n\u2003P(H\u2080 \u2227 FIN) = P(H\u2080)\u00b7P(FIN) = 0,\n\nbut when we replace the prior with a new probability that assigns FIN measure 1, the equality is vacuous. We have simply left the universe in which the independence fact held.\n\nIndependence, then, does **not** survive conditionalization on FIN, because the very act of learning FIN yanks us out of the probability space in which independence was defined.\n\n4. An argument that forces P(H\u2080\u2502FIN)=0\n\nConsider the random variable T that counts the total number of heads. FIN is the event \u201cT is finite.\u201d Let \u03bc(\u00b7\u2502FIN) be any posterior probability that (i) assigns FIN probability 1 and (ii) preserves exchangeability of the coins (a symmetry requirement every reasonable Bayesian should still accept\u2014the labelling of people carries no evidential weight). Suppose, for reductio, that \u03bc(H\u2080\u2502FIN)=\u03b5>0. By exchangeability, \u03bc(H_n\u2502FIN)=\u03b5 for every n. Then\n\n\u2003E_\u03bc[T\u2502FIN] = \u03a3_{n=0}^{\u221e} \u03bc(H_n\u2502FIN)  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003= \u03a3_{n=0}^{\u221e} \u03b5  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003= \u221e,\u2003 because \u03b5>0.\n\nBut FIN assures us T is finite with \u03bc-probability 1, so E_\u03bc[T\u2502FIN] must itself be finite. Contradiction. Therefore \u03b5=0. By the very same symmetry E_\u03bc(H_n\u2502FIN)=0 for every n. In plain English: *given that only finitely many heads occurred, the chance that any specific coin was one of them must be zero.*\n\nThis argument is perfectly rigorous; it uses only countable additivity of expectation and the idea that posteriors respecting the evidence must make the expectation of a bounded random variable finite. No question-begging about independence remains.\n\n5. Can the symmetry assumption be rejected?\n\nOne might attempt to salvage a non-zero credence by abandoning exchangeability in the posterior: perhaps FIN correlates early indexes with heads, later indexes with tails. But that is ad hoc in two ways.\n\nFirst, nothing in the evidence singles out early people. Second, even without explicit exchangeability, we can run a *coarser* version of the above argument. Let N be the largest index of a head (finite by FIN). Conditional on \u201cN \u2265 k\u201d, the probability you are heads is at most 1/(k+1) (there are k+1 coins to choose from, of which at most k+1 are heads). Since \u201cN \u2265 k\u201d holds for every k (we have no upper bound), the limit forces your credence to 0. Making the posterior non-exchangeable therefore does not help.\n\n6. Maximum-entropy confirmation\n\nA different, more constructive route to the same verdict uses the Principle of Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt): pick the posterior distribution that (i) satisfies the new constraint (FIN) and (ii) minimises relative entropy (Kullback\u2013Leibler divergence) from the prior. For an i.i.d. prior, the unique MaxEnt posterior sets every coin deterministically to tails except for *some* finite set of indexes about which it remains agnostic. In that posterior each particular coin is almost surely tails, hence credence 0 in heads. MaxEnt thus coincides with the expectation argument.\n\n7. Why \u201calmost surely tails\u201d is not paradoxical\n\nSome find the answer counter-intuitive: \u201cIf each specific coin has probability 0 of being heads, how can any heads occur at all?\u201d The resolution is familiar from standard measure theory. Probability-0 events are not impossible; they are merely negligible *with respect to the measure*. The posterior we have built allows (with probability 1) that the set of heads is finite, yet for every fixed n it is *possible* (though measure-0) that coin n lands heads. Finite additivity ensures consistency: a countable union of measure-0 sets can have positive measure (in fact, 1). There is no contradiction, only the unavoidable subtleties of infinity.\n\n8. Objections and replies\n\nObjection A: \u201cBut conditionalising on probability-zero events is arbitrary; why privilege the 0 answer over \u00bd or 1/\u03c0?\u201d  \nReply: The expectation argument shows that any posterior with a positive conditional chance for H\u2080 contradicts a *logical implication* of the evidence\u2014namely, that the expected number of heads is finite. Posteriors giving value \u00bd are therefore incoherent with FIN.\n\nObjection B: \u201cThe argument presupposes countable additivity. A finitist Bayesian might drop that axiom.\u201d  \nReply: True but unmotivated. Countable additivity underwrites the very probability theory in which we formulated FIN. If one wants to explain the everyday successes of classical probability, jettisoning the axiom is too high a price.\n\nObjection C: \u201cYour result makes learning too powerful. How can a single bit of testimony override the direct physical information that the coin was fair?\u201d  \nReply: Learning FIN is not *one bit* in any informational sense. It encodes an infinite pattern among infinitely many tosses. Conditioning on it is informationally gargantuan; it is unsurprising that such wholesale information swamps the small-scale physical propensity of a particular toss.\n\n9. Philosophical upshot: the brittleness of independence and the geometry of zero\n\nWe have encountered a vivid instance of two general morals.\n\n(1) Independence is *fragile under learning*. Tails of sequences, propensity facts, and local causal stories do not by themselves guarantee future independence once we condition on global constraints. Philosophers sometimes treat causal independence as inviolable. The present case shows that independence is hostage to one\u2019s total information state.\n\n(2) Conditioning on measure-zero events is not automatically well-defined; extra principles are needed. Those principles can come from symmetry, maximum entropy, or (as here) coherence with logical implications of the evidence. Once they are supplied, probability-zero \u201cmiracles\u201d can and often do force credence changes all the way to 0 or 1.\n\n10. Conclusion\n\nRational credence in H\u2080, after learning FIN, should be 0. The route to that conclusion is indirect because the standard Bayesian recipe (divide by P(FIN)) breaks down. But demanding coherence with the truth that *only finitely many heads exist* places a strict upper bound on the probability any particular coin is one of them, and that bound is zero. Symmetry-based arguments for sticking with \u00bd overlook how independence evaporates when we condition on events of prior measure zero. The puzzle is a dramatic illustration of how infinite combinatorics and the geometry of null sets reshape epistemic landscapes\u2014a salutary reminder that in the probabilistic labyrinth, the walls themselves move when we shine new light.", "output_tokens": 5984, "reasoning_tokens": 3712}

Framing the puzzle\n\nImagine an \u03c9-long row of fair coins, one for each person in an infinite room.  All coins are flipped simultaneously but concealed.  A loud-speaker then announces the seemingly impossible:  \u201cOnly finitely many of the flips came up heads.\u201d  Your epistemic question is local\u2014what to believe about your own coin\u2014yet it is posed against a global background in which something of probability 0 has just been learned.  Standard Bayesian conditionalisation, P(A\u2502E)=P(A\u2227E)/P(E), gives no guidance when P(E)=0, so any answer must draw on deeper principles\u2014symmetry, regular conditional probabilities, indexical information, and the logic of \u201clearning from a miracle.\u201d  \n\nI shall defend the following thesis.\n\nThesis:  Given only the information that (i) the coins were originally fair and independent and (ii) in fact only finitely many landed heads, a rational agent should set her posterior credence that her own coin is a head to 0.  In effect, learning the global fact shatters the original independence; after the update, each particular coin is almost-surely a tail.  The rival view, that the credence should remain at \u00bd, rests on a misapplication of independence in a setting where the evidence itself breaks it.\n\nThe argument proceeds in five stages.  (1)  I formalise the sample space and highlight why the ordinary conditional probability is undefined.  (2)  I construct a **regular conditional distribution** on the zero-measure event and prove that it forces the probability of heads for every fixed coin to be 0.  (3)  I answer the intuitive worry that \u201cthere are *some* heads, so why not me?\u201d.  (4)  I examine two alternative update rules\u2014\u201cignore the miracle\u201d and \u201ctypicality reasoning\u201d\u2014and show why they either violate basic symmetry or collapse back into the 0-credence verdict.  (5)  I tease out the philosophical moral:  whenever evidence reduces an infinite family of exchangeable events to a *finite* subfamily, each particular event inherits probability 0, even though, collectively, some occur.\n\n2.  Formal preliminaries and the zero-measure obstacle\n\nLet \u03a9 = {0,1}^\u2135\u2080 be the space of infinite binary sequences, indexed by \u2115.  \nFor \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9, write H(\u03c9) = {n : \u03c9\u2099 = 1}.  \nThe fair product measure \u03bc on (\u03a9,\ud835\udd39) makes the coordinate projections X\u2099(\u03c9) = \u03c9\u2099 independent and \u03bc(X\u2099=1)=\u00bd.\n\nDefine the \u201cmiracle\u201d event\n\u2003F  = {\u03c9 :  |H(\u03c9)|  <  \u03c9}.  \u2003(There are only finitely many heads.)\n\nBy the Strong Law and Kolmogorov\u2019s 0\u20131 law F is a tail event with \u03bc(F)=0.  \nHence P(X\u2080=1\u2502F) is undefined inside ordinary Kolmogorov theory.  The question is therefore which, if any, *regular* conditional probabilities we should adopt.\n\n3.  A symmetry-based regular conditional distribution\n\nA **regular conditional probability** (rcp) for X\u2080 given F is a function r  with:\n\n(i)  r(\u03c9) \u2208 [0,1] for all \u03c9\u2208F;\n(ii)  For every measurable A\u2286\u03a9, the map \u03c9\u21a6r_A(\u03c9):=r(\u03c9)(A) is measurable on F;\n(iii)  \u03bc(A \u2229 F) = \u222b_F  r_A(\u03c9)  d\u03bc(\u03c9).\n\nBecause \u03bc(F)=0, condition (iii) imposes almost no uniqueness constraints; additional principles must therefore select the \u201cright\u201d rcp.  Two natural demands suffice:\n\nS1\u2014Shift invariance.  Exchanging the labels of people ought not matter.  Formally, let \u03c3_k be the k-step left-shift on \u03a9.  The posterior measure conditioned on F should satisfy r(\u03c3_k\u03c9)=r(\u03c9) for \u03bc-a.e. \u03c9\u2208F.\n\nS2\u2014Countable additivity, hence finite\u2010support events retain probability 0 unless forced otherwise.\n\nProposition 1.  Under S1 and S2 there is exactly one rcp on F, namely the measure \u03bd that puts probability 1 on the all-tails sequence.  Consequently, for every fixed n,\n\u2003\u03bd(X\u2099=1) = 0.\n\nSketch of proof.  Suppose toward contradiction that \u03bd(X\u2080=1)=\u03b5>0.  By shift invariance \u03bd(X_k=1)=\u03b5 for every k.  Because there are countably many coins, the expected number of heads under \u03bd is \u2211\u2096 \u03b5 = \u221e, contradicting the definition of F which restricts support to sequences with *finitely* many heads.  Hence \u03b5=0.  No other choice satisfies both S1 and finite-heads support. \u25a1\n\nCorollary.  Any agent who adopts (S1,S2) must set posterior credence P(X_my)=0.\n\n4.  \u201cBut some coins are heads\u2014why not mine?\u201d  \n\nThe corollary can feel paradoxical.  After all, the announcement guarantees at least one head.  If *somebody* got heads, how can **everyone** be certain they did not?  The feeling stems from equivocating between two kinds of probability.\n\na.  Person\u2010indexed probability.  You are a *particular* n.  Conditioned on F, each fixed coin is head with probability 0, though mutually they cannot *all* be tails because F allows finitely many heads.  The situation is analogous to an infinite lottery in which each ticket has probability 0 of winning, yet somebody wins.  Probability-0 is not impossibility.\n\nb.  Random-sample probability.  If instead a coin is picked uniformly at random *after* the miracle, the probability the chosen coin is a head is >0 (indeed equal to 1/N if the actual number of heads is N).  But that is not your epistemic situation unless you learn an extra fact\u2014*that you are a random sample* from the room.\n\nOnce the distinction is clear, the alleged paradox evaporates.  Your perspective is person\u2010indexed, not randomly sampled, so 0 is coherent.\n\n5.  Assessing rival update rules\n\n5.1  \u201cStick to \u00bd: independence is sacred.\u201d\n\nA tempting reaction is:  \u201cMy coin was fair and independent of the rest; learning something about the total should not affect its probability.\u201d  But the inference is invalid.  Fairness and independence governed the *prior*.  Conditionalising on F introduces *perfect negative dependency*: any head elsewhere reduces the *permissible* quota of remaining heads.  To cling to independence is to refuse to incorporate the new information.\n\nFormally, assume a posterior P with P(X\u2080=1)=\u00bd.  Shift invariance then forces P(exactly k heads) = 0 for all finite k (else expected heads is infinite), contradicting the new certainty that only finitely many heads occurred.  Hence no self-consistent joint posterior keeps your coin at \u00bd.\n\n5.2  \u201cTypicality reasoning.\u201d\n\nSome argue that, because only finitely many heads occurred, the *proportion* of heads is 0; therefore the chance that a \u201ctypical\u201d person is a head should be 0.  Our symmetry argument already reproduced this conclusion; but typicality adds nothing new and, worse, threatens to smuggle in anthropic premises\u2014*I am randomly selected from the room*\u2014that were not part of the evidence.  The virtue of the rcp construction is precisely that it reaches the 0-credence verdict *without* relying on indexical uncertainty.\n\n5.3  \u201cRegularisation by approximating events.\u201d\n\nAnother school suggests conditioning on the nested events F_m := {at most m heads in the first  m\u00b2  coins}, taking m\u2192\u221e.  One easily computes P(X\u2080=1\u2502F_m)=\u00bd for every finite m, so the limit remains \u00bd.  The trouble is that (F_m) does not converge to F; sequences with finitely many heads but whose first m\u00b2 coins are nearly all tails can still evade every F_m.  Regularisation by arbitrary approximating sequences is therefore not canonical.  When we approximate F **symmetrically**, e.g. by G_m := {at most m heads in the first m coins}, a different limit process gives 0.  The uniqueness result in \u00a73 shows that only the latter respects S1 and S2.\n\n6.  Philosophical morals\n\nA.  Learning from measure-zero evidence.  Bayesian orthodoxy often declares such cases \u201cundefined,\u201d but practical epistemology cannot stop there.  The natural extension is:  pick a regular conditional distribution constrained by symmetry and the qualitative content of the evidence.  In our coin room, that extension is unique and forces drastic belief revision.\n\nB.  The lottery-paradox lesson.  \u201cZero\u201d does not entail \u201cimpossible.\u201d  In infinite contexts, one can be certain (credence 1) that each particular event fails while also being certain that *some* event succeeds.  Assigning credence 0 to being the winner is not an evasion of logic but a feature of countable additivity.\n\nC.  Independence is defeasible.  Evidence bearing on a joint property of infinitely many variables can break their mutual independence even when it mentions none of them individually.  The intuitive slogan \u201cmy coin\u2019s flip is independent\u201d must be relativised to one\u2019s *current* evidence state.\n\n7.  Conclusion\n\nIn the striking situation where a probability-0 global fact is revealed, the only principled update that honours symmetry and the content of the evidence drives the posterior probability of your coin\u2019s being heads all the way down to 0.  The answer \u00bd founders on the false presupposition that independence survives conditionalisation; \u201ctypicality\u201d reasoning is either redundant or illicitly anthropic.  Thus a rational Bayesian flips, as it were, from equipoise to near-certainty of tails the moment the miracle is announced.\n\nApproximately 2 000 words.", "output_tokens": 4746, "reasoning_tokens": 2560}

Introduction and Thesis\n\nPeople often learn to want what they can realistically get. An inmate starts desiring the quiet predictability of prison life; an under-resourced rural girl claims she never wanted to attend school; a long-term care worker insists that \u201ccleaning bedpans is my calling.\u201d These are paradigm cases of adaptive preference formation: a person\u2019s motivational set is reshaped in response to hard constraints on her feasible options. Many philosophers and social theorists\u2014Sen, Elster, Nussbaum, Superson, Benson\u2014intuit that such preferences are \u201cnot quite theirs\u201d in the full, self-authoring sense. But exactly why are they less than fully autonomous?\n\nI defend the following thesis.  \n\nThe autonomy deficit of adaptive preferences is best explained by a relational-historical account: a preference is non-autonomous when its formation is traceably dependent on illegitimate social power that pre-empts the agent\u2019s reflective and imaginative capacities. Subjectivist \u201cendorsement\u201d models falter because sincere endorsement can itself be a symptom of domination; purely content-based tests collapse autonomy into moral value; only an account that looks to the genesis of the preference\u2014specifically, to whether the shaping constraints arose from domination or from ordinary environmental influence\u2014can vindicate our mixed judgments about adaptive preferences. The historical dimension must, however, be relational rather than merely causal: what matters is whether another\u2019s power or a social structure usurped the agent\u2019s authority over her own evaluative horizons.\n\n2. Clarifying Adaptive Preferences\n\nJon Elster coined the term by re-animating Aesop\u2019s fox who declared the unreachable grapes sour. In development ethics, Amartya Sen worries about \u201chappy peasants\u201d reporting high life-satisfaction despite malnutrition. Feminist writers point to women in patriarchal cultures who prefer clitoridectomy, early marriage, or house-bound lives. Formally, a preference P of agent A is adaptive when:\n\n(a) P emerges after A learns that higher-valued alternatives are infeasible or normatively off-limits;  \n(b) The change is motivated by reducing the psychological dissonance between desire and possibility.\n\nNothing in that definition yet implies non-autonomy. Sometimes adaptation is rational, even liberating: shipwrecked sailors valuably learn to want seaweed soup. The puzzle is selective: some adaptive desires seem innocent, others self-betraying. A successful account must therefore distinguish benign from autonomy-undermining adaptation without condemning adaptation as such.\n\n3. The Subjectivist Route: Frankfurt\u2019s Hierarchy and Its Limits\n\nOn Harry Frankfurt\u2019s influential hierarchy, an agent is autonomous with respect to a first-order desire D iff she reflectively endorses D\u2014has a second-order volition that D be effective. Add \u201cwholeheartedness\u201d (Frankfurt 1992) and you have a sophisticated subjectivist picture: what matters is internal endorsement, not content or causal history.\n\nApplied to adaptive preferences, the diagnosis seems simple: if the rural girl wholeheartedly wants domesticity, then domesticity is autonomously wanted. Yet this yields counter-intuitive results. Consider:\n\nThe Child Bride.  \nFatima, 14, in a remote province, states (after indirect parental and religious pressure) that what she most wants is to marry the 30-year-old neighbor chosen for her. She testifies, plausibly sincerely, that she \u201cwould not know what to do\u201d with schooling or wage labor.\n\nMost of us hesitate to treat this desire as fully self-authored. Yet Frankfurt\u2019s model, satisfied by authentic endorsement, must declare it autonomous. Proponents often reply:\n\nReply 1: Fatima\u2019s endorsement is not wholehearted; she\u2019s internally conflicted.  \nReply 2: Her endorsement is the product of coercion; thus her desire fails the \u201cfree and informed second-order\u201d requirement.\n\nBoth replies, however, stretch the subjectivist machinery. For many dominated agents internal conflict is precisely what centuries of socialization aim to eradicate: the point of a patriarchal script is to arrange matters so women do not feel torn. And Frankfurt\u2019s model lacks resources to grade degrees of social influence; almost all desires depend causally on upbringing, yet most remain autonomous. The model needs a way to single out illegitimate influences\u2014a task it was never built to perform.\n\nA deeper worry: subjectivism treats self-reflection as a private, intrapsychic affair. But oppressive power works by shaping the field of imaginable options before reflection even begins. A preference can satisfy every internalist test while its very horizon of endorsement has been colonized. What is missing is a diachronic, socially embedded perspective on how the preference came to be.\n\n4. Content-Based Tests: Autonomy as Moral Filter?\n\nA second family of views ties autonomy to the material or moral content of what is preferred. Nussbaum\u2019s \u201ccapability\u201d approach, while primarily a theory of justice, sometimes intimates that rejecting central human capabilities evidences diminished agency. On a content view, Fatima\u2019s desire is non-autonomous because what she wants is objectively bad for her\u2014foreclosing valuable future functioning.\n\nContent tests correctly capture that some adaptive desires undermine human flourishing. Yet they face an equally familiar objection: immoral or self-defeating desires can be autonomous. A Nazi officer may wholeheartedly and reflectively choose evil. We generally distinguish ethical appraisal (the desire is reprehensible) from agential appraisal (it is his own). Conflating the two collapses autonomy into prudential or moral rightness. Even Nussbaum ultimately appeals to social-historical factors\u2014patriarchy, poverty\u2014to explain why capability deprivation warps desire. When we push, content analyses smuggle in history. So let us look directly at historical approaches.\n\n5. Historical Accounts: From Causal to Relational\n\nHistorical theories claim that autonomy hinges on the provenance of a preference. Roughly, a desire is autonomous if it was not caused by manipulation, coercion, or other autonomy-defeating mechanisms. Gerald Dworkin\u2019s early \u201cprocedural independence\u201d clause, Alfred Mele\u2019s \u201cbypassing\u201d model, and John Christman\u2019s \u201crestrictive historical\u201d account all illustrate the idea.\n\nThe obvious advantage: we can say Fatima\u2019s desire is non-autonomous because it was forged under patriarchal constraints that bypassed her critical faculties\u2014it is traceably dependent on illegitimate social power. This explains why sincere endorsement is not enough and why morally dubious yet self-chosen desires (the Nazi) can still be autonomous when formed under normal epistemic circumstances.\n\nStill, standard historical tests face an over-breadth problem. Every preference has some causal ancestry in non-chosen factors: parenting, culture, neurochemistry. If causal infiltration suffices to void autonomy, none of us is autonomous. Historical theorists respond by specifying special kinds of causal routes\u2014deception, brainwashing, emotional abuse\u2014that are autonomy-defeaters. But adaptive preference cases rarely involve such dramatic techniques. The shaping mechanisms are ambient, diffuse, long-term: social norms, material scarcity, ideological discourse. To capture them, a merely causal metric is inadequate; we need a relational one that gauges the authority with which external agents or structures establish the feasible set.\n\n6. A Relational-Historical Proposal\n\nAutonomy is fundamentally a norm of self-authoring authority, not merely a psychological state. This authority can be undermined by relationships of domination\u2014structured asymmetries of power that systematically condition which options are available and which evaluative perspectives seem \u201cthinkable.\u201d I therefore propose:\n\nRelational-Historical Condition (RHC)  \nA preference P of agent A at time t is non-autonomous to the extent that:  \n\n(i) P\u2019s formation is counterfactually dependent on a social relationship R of domination (or on an institutional structure embodying such domination); and  \n(ii) R functions by pre-empting or truncating A\u2019s capacities for critical reflection and imaginative exploration of alternatives; and  \n(iii) A lacks reasonable opportunities, at or after t, to re-examine P free of the pre-empting influence.\n\nSeveral features merit notice.\n\na. Relational, not merely causal. Ordinary causal formation (parental teaching, peer influence) is compatible with autonomy. What matters is whether the influence is backed by domination\u2014power that renders the agent subordinate and voiceless in setting evaluative agendas.\n\nb. Historical, not synchronic. Autonomy assessment is diachronic: we ask how P came about and whether the agent had fair chances to revisit it.\n\nc. Degree-based. Autonomy comes in degrees; adaptation to mild scarcity may shave, not erase, self-authorship.\n\nd. Option- and Imagination-Focused. It is not deprivation of physical options alone that matters, but pre-emption of the agent\u2019s imaginative horizon\u2014that deeper \u201cset of live possibilities\u201d from which one chooses.\n\n7. Two Useful Distinctions\n\nTo sharpen RHC, I introduce two distinctions not common in the literature.\n\n7.1 Strategic vs. Internalized Adaptation  \nStrategic adaptation occurs when an agent adjusts surface preferences for pragmatic coping while privately retaining a preference for the unavailable good. Prisoners who \u201clearn\u201d to prefer isolation but fantasize about freedom exemplify it. Internalized adaptation goes deeper: the unavailable option no longer figures even in the agent\u2019s imagination. Autonomy deficits are more acute in the internalized case because critical perspective has been eroded.\n\n7.2 Pre-emptive vs. Reactive Constraint  \nSome constraints operate pre-emptively: they never allow the alternative preference to take hold (e.g., censorship forbidding certain ideas). Others are reactive: the agent tries the alternative but abandons it under pressure (e.g., a divorced woman returning to abusive marriage due to financial threats). Pre-emptive domination poses a special threat because it blocks the very conditions of critical comparison.\n\nThese distinctions are instrumental. Frankfurt\u2019s hierarchy could in principle model reactive constraints\u2014an agent might come to disendorse a desire after reflection\u2014but it misses pre-emptive imagination gaps. Content views misclassify strategic adaptation as non-autonomous if the content is disvaluable, ignoring the agent\u2019s private dissent. Historical-relational analysis, sensitive to pre-emptive domination and internalized adaptation, can explain both cases.\n\n8. Examples Doing Real Work\n\n8.1 Harriet Jacobs\u2019s Attic Refuge  \nIn 1835, fugitive slave Harriet Jacobs spent seven years in a cramped attic crawl space to avoid sexual predation. She writes that she \u201cgrew to love the darkness as a friend.\u201d This is strategic adaptation: the preference for darkness facilitated survival but never erased her longing for freedom. Autonomy deficit here is limited; her secret diaries show critical distance. RHC predicts this: domination constrained her options but did not fully pre-empt imaginative alternatives.\n\n8.2 The Contented Care Worker  \nConsider Mei, a migrant care worker who, after years of low-status labor, professes genuine satisfaction in \u201chelping others with dignity.\u201d Suppose no covert resentment lurks; she has never been exposed to narratives in which care work commands social esteem or higher wages. Mei\u2019s preference likely depends on a gendered global labor regime that channels women of color into undervalued caring roles, systematically restricting exposure to alternatives and interpreting self-assertion as selfish. Here RHC diagnoses a severe autonomy deficit: relational domination (patriarchy, racial capitalism) pre-emptively shapes her evaluative horizon.\n\nThese cases illustrate why we need relational-historical analysis: they are treated differently despite similar contents (\u201cI prefer X to unavailable Y\u201d) and despite endorsements supplied by Frankfurt\u2019s test.\n\n9. Addressing Objections\n\nObjection 1: The View Is Paternalistic\u2014Who Are We to Declare Someone\u2019s Endorsed Preference Non-autonomous?\n\nReply. RHC is not an external imposition of values but a procedural insistence on who gets to set the evaluative menu. Declaring a preference non-autonomous triggers duties to expand the agent\u2019s horizon, not to substitute our choices for hers. Indeed, respecting autonomy requires dismantling domination so that the agent can author her own worldview\u2014including, possibly, reaffirming the original preference.\n\nObjection 2: All Preferences Have Social Histories; RHC Collapses into Global Skepticism.\n\nReply. Domination, unlike mere influence, involves systematic asymmetries that block critique. We can operationalize this using social epidemiology of information, testimonial injustice, and resource distribution metrics. Not every causal influence satisfies clause (i); only those that silence the agent\u2019s authority over her evaluative standpoint.\n\nObjection 3: The Nazi Officer\u2019s Racist Desires Seem Autonomously Chosen Even Though They Depend on Social Domination (anti-Semitic culture). Doesn\u2019t RHC Imply Otherwise?\n\nReply. The officer\u2019s preferences indeed trace to a context rife with domination\u2014but domination directed outward, not at him. Clause (ii) requires that domination pre-empt the agent\u2019s own critical capacities. Being advantaged by oppressive structures can cloud moral vision but need not preclude self-authorship. The officer could have encountered alternative viewpoints with relative safety; he chose not to. Thus the relational focus is on who is dominated, not merely whether domination exists.\n\n10. Advantages Over Competitors\n\nCompared with subjectivism, RHC explains why wholehearted endorsement is insufficient when endorsement itself is colonised. Compared with content approaches, it permits autonomy plus wrongdoing, and autonomy minus capability, thus keeping the concepts analytically distinct. Compared with non-relational historical views, it targets the morally salient subset of causal histories\u2014those involving domination\u2014thereby avoiding both over-breadth and under-inclusiveness.\n\n11. Implications and Further Research\n\nRHC invites empirical as well as normative inquiry. Measuring autonomy deficits becomes partly a sociological task: mapping networks of power, information flow, and imaginative suppression. It also reframes policy debates: the remedy for non-autonomous adaptive preferences is not necessarily paternalistic override but dismantling relational domination\u2014expanding education, legal rights, media plurality, economic security.\n\nPhilosophically, the proposal suggests autonomy is not a purely individual property but an emergent relational one. This view aligns with \u201crelational autonomy\u201d theorists (Oshana, Mackenzie, Stoljar) yet adds a counterfactual historical test, providing a nuanced metric rather than a loose slogan. Future work might generalize RHC to collective agency: can whole communities suffer adaptive cultural preferences that limit collective self-determination?\n\n12. Conclusion\n\nAdaptive preferences expose the limits of inward-looking theories of autonomy. A person\u2019s sincere, wholehearted embrace of life\u2019s givens can itself be testimony to how thoroughly her evaluative horizon has been colonized. To diagnose the autonomy deficit we must look backward and outward: backward to the historical pathway by which desire was shaped, outward to the relational matrices of power that set the menu of imaginables. Subjectivist endorsement and content-based adequacy each capture fragments of the phenomenon, but only a relational-historical account can explain why some adaptations are tainted by oppression while others are not. Autonomy, properly understood, is the unfolding of self-authorship in a social world; where domination scripts the self, the authorial voice is muted, however serene the script may sound.", "output_tokens": 3825, "reasoning_tokens": 640}

The Puzzle  \n\nPoor women who say they \u201cnever wanted\u201d an education, long-term prisoners who \u201cprefer\u201d the regimented life of the institution, members of a caste who \u201cchoose\u201d the work that stigmatizes them\u2014these are standard examples of adaptive preferences (APs).  Their common structure is this: (i) objective constraints\u2014material, social, or psychological\u2014make certain valuable options practically unavailable; (ii) agents adjust what they want so that the remaining, diminished option set looks attractive; and (iii) when asked, they may sincerely affirm the preference they have come to hold.  Intuitively, something has gone wrong for autonomy.  Yet it is surprisingly hard to say exactly what: after all, the person is not being forced, may even endorse the preference on reflection, and need not be ignorant of the alternatives.  Why, then, do APs seem\u2014at least sometimes\u2014less than fully self-authored?\n\nI will defend the following thesis.  The autonomy deficit of paradigm APs is best explained by a *historical-relational* account: a preference is non-autonomous when its formation is importantly shaped by an *unjust restriction of the agent\u2019s practical possibilities* in such a way that the agent has had *no reasonable opportunity* to subject that preference to critical revision free from domination.  Subjectivist \u201cendorsement\u201d tests miss the way oppressive constraints pre-empt deliberation before it begins; pure content-based tests collapse autonomy into a moralised ideal; a historical-relational test identifies the right locus of damage\u2014*the process through which oppressive structures edit the menu of live options*\u2014while still allowing that not every socially shaped preference is heteronomous.  I close by refining the view and answering three objections.\n\n2. Why the Usual Taxonomy Helps and Hinders  \n\nPhilosophers standardly sort autonomy theories into (A) subjectivist/procedural, (B) content-based, and (C) historical.  The taxonomy is useful, but in the present context it also obscures.  Adaptive preferences highlight a phenomenon in which (i) the procedure of endorsement can itself be colonised; (ii) the *content* looks blameworthy only because of the process that produced it; and (iii) history matters precisely insofar as it embodies an ongoing power relation, not a bygone event.  So the three families of theories are not mutually exclusive: the best view will braid them, though history supplies the anchoring thread.\n\n3. Subjectivist Accounts: The Problem of **Happy Slaves**  \n\nOn Harry Frankfurt\u2019s influential hierarchical model, a desire is autonomous when the agent *decides* at a second order to let that desire move her to action.  \u201cWholehearted\u201d identification seems to immunise against alienation.  Yet in many AP cases\u2014call them *happy\u2010slave cases*\u2014agents do identify with their restricted desires.  The \u201ccontented housewife\u201d in some of Martha Nussbaum\u2019s examples *wholeheartedly* wants to stay uneducated, avoiding the cognitive dissonance between her life prospects and a thwarted longing for more.  \n\nWhy that wholeheartedness fails to secure autonomy can be seen by asking: *From what menu were the second-order attitudes themselves selected?*  If patriarchal norms have rendered certain aspirations literally unthinkable or morally shameful, then the reflective hierarchy has been rigged.  Frankfurt\u2019s model treats the mind as a closed system whose internal endorsements fix authority; APs reveal that the system has inputs\u2014and those inputs may be filtered by oppression before reflection even begins.  \n\nSophisticated subjectivists try to patch the theory by adding epistemic or imaginative requirements: the agent must endorse her desire *while aware of relevant alternatives*.  But knowledge is not enough.  The contented housewife might know women who went to university and nonetheless regard their lives as \u201cnot for the likes of me\u201d\u2014a judgment born of internalised norms rather than factual ignorance.  Procedural tests that stop at inner endorsement therefore miss exactly what renders an AP suspect: the *structural deprivation* that shapes what can be endorsed.\n\n4. Content-Based Accounts: The Lure and Cost of Perfectionism  \n\nSeeing this, some philosophers shift ground.  On content views, certain aims\u2014servility, self-abnegation, cruelty\u2014are autonomy-undermining simply in virtue of what they are.  A preference to be dominated is heteronomous because domination is bad for you, period.  Nussbaum\u2019s capability approach uses an objective list of central human functions; preferences that renounce these capabilities lack authority.  If a girl \u201cprefers\u201d early marriage to schooling, her preference is dis-qualified because it frustrates the capability for practical reasoning, regardless of her endorsement.  \n\nContent views have two virtues.  First, they capture our sense that some life plans, no matter how sincerely chosen, stunt the chooser.  Second, they license protective interventions without needing to scrutinise a person\u2019s inner mental history.  \n\nBut the cost is high.  Autonomy is rendered hostage to *moral* appraisal.  A conscientious ascetic who freely vows poverty, or a devout nun who relinquishes sexual intimacy, would come out as non-autonomous if the objective list declares wealth or sex essential.  Worse, content views mis-locate the wrong of APs.  What bothers us is not merely that the contented housewife lacks a capability; it is that *she lacks it because gender injustice has pressed her to adapt.*  The same life choice, made in a society that offers genuine parity of esteem for alternative roles, would not ring the same alarm bells.  Hence a purely content-based diagnosis is both over- and under-inclusive.\n\n5. Historical Accounts: Process, Power, and the Counterfactual Test  \n\nHistorical accounts focus on *how* a desire came about.  Gerald Dworkin\u2019s early autonomy story, Laura Ekstrom\u2019s coherentism, and, more pointedly, Marina Oshana\u2019s and Ben-Peterson\u2019s relational autonomy theories insist that oppressive socialization can sabotage self-authorship even if the agent currently embraces the result.  The intuitive test is counterfactual: had the unjust constraints not operated, would the agent likely still prefer X?  If not, her present preference inherits the taint of domination.\n\nTwo refinements are needed if a historical view is to illuminate APs rather than merely label them.\n\n5.1. Disentangling Bad History from *Any* History  \nAll preferences have histories; most are social.  We need a principled way to mark the *autonomy-defeating* subset.  My proposal: (i) the formation process involves *unjust* restriction of options, where injustice is understood in relational terms\u2014domination, exploitation, stigmatization; (ii) that restriction is *relevant* because it deprives the agent of a *reasonable opportunity* to assess the preference in conditions where repudiation is feasible and non-punitive.\n\n5.2. The Ongoing Character of Oppression  \nTalk of \u201chow the preference was formed\u201d invites a picture of a past event now over.  Yet APs are sustained by *current* structures.  A domestic worker who \u201cchooses\u201d to remain undocumented because she fears deportation is not labouring under a historical hangover; the coercive environment is live.  A viable historical account must therefore be *diachronic*: it appraises a preference relative to the *continuing social relations* that keep alternative aspirations off the table.  \n\nWith these refinements, history pinpoints autonomy\u2019s deficit: oppressive constraints do two things at once\u2014*they curtail the option set* and *they sculpt the agent\u2019s evaluative outlook* so that the curtailed set feels acceptable.  The first mechanism matters because it blocks critical testing of incipient desires (you cannot try out university if girls are barred); the second matters because it forestalls even the wish for such testing.\n\n6. A Hybrid Proposal: Critical-History Autonomy  \n\nPutting the pieces together, we get a hybrid that locates the decisive failure in process yet imports procedural and content considerations as secondary screens:\n\nCritical-History Autonomy (CHA):  \nAn agent\u2019s preference P is autonomous iff  \n(i) its formation has not been substantially shaped by unjust practical constraints that deprived the agent of a reasonable chance to revise P free from domination; and  \n(ii) the agent now has\u2014*and recognises herself as having*\u2014such a revision opportunity; and  \n(iii) nothing in the present social context coerces her evaluation of P (procedural independence); while  \n(iv) the content of P does not pre-empt  (i)\u2013(iii) by directly violating the minimal conditions of agency itself (e.g., a desire to annihilate one\u2019s capacity for choice altogether).\n\nClause (i) does the explanatory heavy lifting for AP cases; clauses (ii)\u2013(iv) prevent over-breadth.  Historical taint can be \u201cwashed clean\u201d if the agent subsequently acquires meaningful, oppression-free occasions for critique and still owns the preference.  That is why not every preference shaped by childhood religion is non-autonomous: the adult may later test and reaffirm it under conditions satisfying (ii)\u2013(iii).  Likewise clause (iv) guards against the odd preference that destroys agency in a self-devouring way, whatever its history.\n\n7. Why CHA Outperforms Its Rivals  \n\n7.1. Against Procedural Subjectivism  \nBecause CHA asks about the *standing* of the options that initial and higher-order desires could have explored, it explains why wholeheartedness is not enough.  The contented housewife\u2019s internal harmony is purchased at the cost of external silencing of alternative selves.\n\n7.2. Against Pure Content Views  \nBecause CHA measures autonomy by unjust history rather than moralised outcomes, it respects atypical but authentic life plans.  A person who grows up in a just society and freely chooses monastic silence passes clause (i)\u2014there is no unjust foreclosure\u2014and therefore counts as autonomous despite the loss of certain capabilities.\n\n7.3. Dialectical Fertility  \nFinally, CHA harvests the *insight* of each tradition: from subjectivists, the centrality of self-reflective endorsement; from content theorists, the recognition that some preferences can undermine the chooser\u2019s agency; from historians, the idea that oppression operates diachronically.  Yet by integrating these strands it avoids their individual pathologies.\n\n8. Working Examples  \n\nExample 1:  *The Urban Sweatshop Worker.*  Consider Mei, who expresses genuine pride in her factory job and says she \u201cprefers\u201d sixteen-hour shifts to the boredom of schooling.  Shanghai\u2019s hukou system makes rural migrants ineligible for city schools; quitting the job would trigger repatriation.  CHA diagnoses Mei\u2019s preference as non-autonomous: unjust legal and economic constraints (i) molded her occupational wants, and she lacks a realistic, non-punitive space (ii) to experiment with alternatives.  Yet if a decade later her legal status changes, she tries further education, reflects, and still decides she enjoys factory life, clause (i) ceases to apply, and the preference may regain authority.\n\nExample 2:  *The Wilderness Aesthetic.*  Arun grows up in a well-off egalitarian society, spends time solo in the mountains, and comes to prefer a life of hermitic simplicity.  Some might brand this content-based deprivation of sociability.  CHA, however, sees no unjust restriction shaping the desire; Arun\u2019s choice stands.\n\nExample 3:  *The Internalised Misogynist.*  Lara, a philosophy student, sincerely prefers that female authors stay out of analytic publishing.  She has full access to scholarly debates but her online community ridicules feminist topics.  Here clause (iii) does the work: ongoing social coercion\u2014peer ostracism\u2014undermines the independence of Lara\u2019s evaluation.  Should she later engage in diverse forums and still hold the view, it would regain authority despite its objectionable moral content\u2014illustrating CHA\u2019s separation of autonomy from moral value.\n\n9. Objections and Replies  \n\nObjection 1:  \u201cCHA collapses into paternalism.  Who decides what counts as \u2018unjust\u2019 restriction?\u201d  \nReply:  The account is *relational*, not perfectionist.  Unjust restrictions are indexed to generally recognised norms against domination and exploitation.  Disagreement about borderline cases is inevitable, but that is no worse than in free-speech or consent doctrines, where we also must interpret \u2018coercion\u2019 and \u2018force\u2019.  The availability of procedural clause (ii) ensures that even controversial preferences can vindicate themselves if the agent later reassesses in fair conditions.\n\nObjection 2:  \u201cYour \u2018reasonable opportunity\u2019 criterion is vague\u2014how much opportunity is enough?\u201d  \nReply:  Vagueness is a feature, not a bug.  Autonomy is a *threshold* concept sensitive to context.  What counts as reasonable varies with the cost of exploration and the gravity of the decision.  Compare informed consent in medicine: we cannot specify an exact quantum of information, but we do know that hiding alternatives or rushing the patient fails.  Likewise, CHA gives principled guidance without fetishising precision inappropriate to complex social reality.\n\nObjection 3:  \u201cSome adapted preferences remain the best the agent can do; condemning them adds insult to injury.\u201d  \nReply:  CHA diagnoses an autonomy *deficit*; it does not blame the victim.  Saying that Mei\u2019s preference is non-autonomous *because* of unjust constraints indicts the constraints, not Mei.  Indeed, recognising the deficit can support policies\u2014expanding option sets\u2014that respect rather than override her agency.\n\n10. A Broader Payoff: Rethinking Autonomy Under Oppression  \n\nThe appeal of pure proceduralism was its promise of neutrality: autonomy without value-judgment.  Adaptive preferences show this promise to be illusory in a world of structurally unequal power.  Meanwhile, the appeal of pure perfectionism was its promise of easy moral leverage; APs show that too much leverage collapses the distinction between doing right *for* someone and letting her do right *for herself*.  \n\nThe critical-history model recommended here keeps autonomy tied to self-authorship yet embeds the self in the social relations that scaffold or stifle its growth.  That dual focus is especially urgent in feminist and post-colonial contexts where adaptation is a survival skill.  Autonomy, on this view, is not a metaphysical predicate of isolated wills but a fragile achievement requiring both internal endorsement and external freedom from domination over time.\n\n11. Conclusion  \n\nAdaptive preferences appear less than fully autonomous not because their contents are always objectionable, nor because the agents invariably fail to identify with them, but because oppressive constraints *front-load* the deliberative process, shaping what can be wanted before the will ever speaks.  A historical-relational account\u2014supplemented by procedural and minimal content safeguards\u2014captures this diagnosis.  It explains why the same preference can be autonomous in a just context yet heteronomous in an unjust one, why wholehearted endorsement does not by itself suffice, and why respecting persons sometimes requires us to look past what they now say they want to the social histories that scripted their wanting.  In doing so, it preserves the critical edge of autonomy while honoring the resilient agency of people who, under adversity, have made themselves desires they can live with\u2014until a larger freedom allows them to want more.", "output_tokens": 3866, "reasoning_tokens": 576}

Yet adaptive preferences\u2014preferences that have bent themselves around the limited, often oppressive, spaces of action actually available to an agent\u2014seem to slip through the mesh of that familiar net.  A woman in a deeply patriarchal village who has come genuinely to prefer not to be educated, or Sen\u2019s well-known case of the chronically undernourished labourer who says he \u201cdoesn\u2019t need\u201d more food, may satisfy the usual tests of internal endorsement, coherence and transparency; but still we hesitate to call their preferences fully autonomous.  Where, precisely, is the deficit located?  \n\nI shall argue for three claims.\n\n1. Purely subjectivist accounts, exemplified by Frankfurt\u2019s hierarchical model, miss the defect because they treat autonomy as exhausted by present-time self-endorsement.  They cannot explain why fully reflective, wholehearted acceptance of a constricted option set still rings hollow.\n\n2. Purely content-based or perfectionist accounts do better at flagging the problem\u2014because oppression usually pushes people toward bad or stunted lives\u2014but they misdiagnose its source.  The worry about adaptive preferences is not that the preferences aim at bad goods simpliciter; it is that they are formed under conditions that silence certain evaluative possibilities altogether.\n\n3. What is needed is a historical-relational account: a preference is non-autonomous when (i) its formation is causally dependent on illegitimate constraints and (ii) those same constraints immunise the preference against critical revision by the agent herself.  This \u201cdouble capture\u201d of genesis and immunisation explains the distinctive unease we have about adaptive preferences, and it does so without committing us to controversial perfectionism or to the implausible view that merely liking what one can get is automatically suspect.\n\nThe upshot is a hybrid: the autonomy deficit of adaptive preferences is best explained historically, but the relevant history is relational\u2014shot through with power\u2014and it matters because it blocks, rather than merely distorts, the agent\u2019s own powers of critical self-direction.\n\nI.  What Is an Adaptive Preference?\n\nThe term comes from Jon Elster, but the phenomenon is older: Aesop\u2019s fox, finding the grapes unreachable, convinces himself they are sour.  Formally, a preference is adaptive when its content tracks a perceived constraint on feasible options: had the constraint not been there, the preference would likely have been different.  The fox\u2019s case is trivial and malevolent only to its protagonist; in human affairs, adaptation is more fraught.  Poor women in rural Rajasthan who say they \u201cprefer\u201d not to see an obstetrician adapt to unaffordable or socially disapproved options; the \u201chappy slave\u201d adapts to an unbreakable institution of domination.\n\nAdaptation is not always bad.  The capacity to revise ambitions when mountains prove unclimbable is part of rational agency.  The problem cases\u2014call them oppressive adaptations\u2014combine three features:\n\n(a)  Tight and systematic external constraints (poverty, patriarchy, racial terror).  \n(b)  Preferences that track those constraints in a way that lowers the agent\u2019s aspirations.  \n(c)  A lingering sense, shared by outsider critics and often by the agent in moments of doubt, that something is illegitimate about how those preferences came to be.\n\nOur explanatory task is to say what, in autonomy-threatening terms, that \u201csomething\u201d is.\n\nII.  The Subjectivist (Hierarchical) Story\n\nFor Harry Frankfurt, an action is free when it issues from a desire the agent wants to have\u2014that is, when first-order desires are endorsed by higher-order volitions.  This procedural condition seems tailor-made for autonomy: its whole point is to avoid substantive paternalism about which desires are worth having.  But consider Amina, a woman raised in a strict Wahhabi enclave who, after years of devout teaching, wholeheartedly wants to be in purdah and second-orderly endorses that first-order desire.  On a Frankfurtian test she is autonomous; yet the sense that her preference is adaptive to patriarchal constraint does not go away.  \n\nWhy does the hierarchical model falter here?  The answer is that it treats self-endorsement as content-blind and history-blind.  Endorsement, for Frankfurt, need not itself be the product of an uncoerced deliberative history; it only has to be present.  But the worry about Amina is precisely that her higher-order volition is the ongoing echo of a social order that never allowed alternative identities to be vivid prospects.  In metaphor: the procedure has been \u201ccolonised\u201d long before it is run.\n\nOne might reply, in Frankfurt\u2019s own later voice, that wholeheartedness demands stability across counterfactual scenarios (\u201cvolitional necessities\u201d).  Yet if every realistic counterfactual world Amina can imagine is also patriarchal, the condition is vacuously satisfied.  Subjectivism thus lacks normative traction against structural constraints that shape the entire imaginative horizon of the agent.\n\nIII.  The Content-Based (Perfectionist) Story\n\nMartha Nussbaum\u2019s capabilities approach uses objective thresholds of functioning: a preference is autonomy-deficient if it is for a life below the line that a dignified human life requires.  Here the explanatory focus is on what is preferred, not on how.  The agent who prefers genital cutting, early marriage, or starvation diets lacks autonomy because she prefers what is sub-dignified.\n\nContent-based accounts have two virtues.  They explain why adaptive preferences so often cluster around deprivation and domination, and they provide a crisp moral verdict.  But they pay a price in both over- and under-inclusiveness:\n\nOver-reach:  Some adaptive preferences are for innocuous or even valuable ends.  Suppose Li Wei, after China\u2019s one-child policy is finally lifted, continues to prefer having only one child, not because of threats or coercion but because his family\u2019s whole urban lifestyle adapted around single-child expectations.  The content (having one child) is not morally deficient; yet the preference is still plausibly an artefact of past coercive constraint.  We hesitate to say Li Wei\u2019s preference is automatically suspect.\n\nUnder-reach:  Content-based tests pass if the end is decent.  Amina\u2019s preference for purdah could, arguendo, satisfy capability thresholds\u2014she may be healthy, well-educated within limits, economically secure.  Yet the preference still feels \u201cnot fully hers.\u201d\n\nWe therefore need an account that homes in on the genealogy of the preference rather than on its object.\n\nIV.  Historical-Relational Accounts\n\nHistorical accounts, pioneered by Gerald Dworkin and developed by John Christman, Daniel Weinstock and Marina Oshana, add a diachronic filter: a desire is autonomous only if it was formed (or could be sustained) under conditions of adequate reflection free from controlling influences.\n\nChristman\u2019s \u201cprocedural independence\u201d requires that the formation process not bypass the agent\u2019s capacities for critical reflection.  Still, critics note, merely causal independence is too thin; after all, upbringing always causes our values.  The key is whether the influence is illegitimate\u2014manipulative, coercive, dominative\u2014and whether it forecloses opportunities for later repudiation.  Hence the historical\u2010relational test I propose:\n\nA preference P of agent A is autonomy-deficient when both:\n\n(H1)  Illegitimate Constraint Genesis: P is the causal product of social constraints that aim to limit A\u2019s evaluative horizons in their own favour (e.g., patriarchal norms, racist laws).  \n\n(H2)  Immunisation: Those same constraints systematically block or de-incentivise the agent\u2019s later capacity to subject P to critical scrutiny\u2014by restricting information, punishing dissent, or inculcating internalised self-policing.\n\nThe \u201cdouble capture\u201d matters.  If (H1) holds but not (H2)\u2014say, a political propaganda campaign that can later be freely examined\u2014the preference may still be revisable and thus not autonomy-deficient.  If (H2) holds without (H1)\u2014say, a preference formed innocently but now maintained by cultic isolation\u2014the deficit re-emerges.  Oppressive adaptive preferences satisfy both.\n\nWhy is this a relational account?  Because illegitimacy is keyed to power relations, not to personal psychology.  What undermines autonomy is that someone\u2019s agency has been bent to serve structurally dominant interests, in ways that block avenues of critique.  The diagnosis therefore captures the phenomenon without blaming the victim or pathologising adaptive rationality per se.\n\nV.  Illustrative Cases\n\n1.  \u201cHappy Slave.\u201d  Raised from birth under slavery, Cassius prefers a life of servitude.  Both H1 and H2 hold: slavery aims to produce such preferences, and lashes (literal or symbolic) dissuade reconsideration.  Cassius lacks autonomy even if he reflectively endorses his condition.\n\n2.  Rural Maternal Mortality.  Women in a region with prohibitively distant clinics report no desire for prenatal care.  The economic and gendered constraints that shaped this preference (H1) persist by keeping clinics distant and literacy low (H2).  Autonomy deficit is explained without presuming that wanting medical care is objectively better; the account accommodates, but does not rely on, perfectionist judgments.\n\n3.  The Grapes Turned Sweet Again.  The fox, on realising that a new ladder has been built, re-evaluates and now wants the grapes.  H2 fails: the earlier constraint is gone, so his earlier adaptive aversion is readily revisable.  No lasting autonomy problem remains.\n\n4.  The Space Colony.  On Mars, terraforming is impossible, so colonists adapt to preferring indoor lives.  The constraint is natural, not illegitimate; H1 fails.  Their preference is adaptive but perfectly autonomous.\n\nThese contrasts show why the historical-relational story pinpoints the autonomy deficit more accurately than its rivals.\n\nVI.  Objections and Replies\n\nObjection 1:  Isn\u2019t illegitimacy in H1 just substantive moralising in disguise?  \nReply:  The benchmark of illegitimacy is relational domination: whether the constraint serves to entrench asymmetric power, not whether the resulting life is \u201cobjectively good.\u201d  This is a political, not perfectionist, criterion.\n\nObjection 2:  The view seems to require ascertaining counterfactuals\u2014what the agent would want absent the constraint\u2014an epistemic morass.  \nReply:  True, counterfactual diagnosis is hard.  But so is any account that hopes to track autonomy under oppression.  Practical proxies exist: evidence of coercion, informational gating, severe asymmetries of power.  Moreover, we need not know the exact counterfactual preference; we need only know that the process blocked the agent\u2019s ordinary capacity to revisit it.\n\nObjection 3:  Is the model too demanding?  Many of our own middle-class preferences were shaped by capitalist advertising that aims to limit critique.  Are they therefore non-autonomous?  \nReply:  They may be partially so.  The view predicts degrees of autonomy.  The fact that some consumer desires bear lesser forms of adaptive deficit is a feature, not a bug: it explains why resisting consumerism often feels like reclaiming agency.  But because liberal societies keep spaces for dissent (libraries, internet, rival subcultures), H2 is less fully satisfied; autonomy erosion is mitigated.\n\nObjection 4:  Why not instead take Sune Laegaard\u2019s \u201csocial conditions for preference change\u201d view, which focuses only on present possibilities of revision?  \nReply:  The historical-relational model subsumes that insight (H2) but adds the genesis clause (H1), which explains why merely having revision capacity tomorrow may not suffice if the cost of exercising it (ostracism, violence) was precisely what shaped the preference in the first place.  Only both together illuminate the depth of adaptive capture.\n\nVII.  Advantages over the Alternatives\n\nCompared to subjectivism, the historical-relational view respects the agent\u2019s reflective standpoint yet refuses to ignore that standpoint\u2019s very possibility conditions.  Compared to content-based views, it avoids perfectionist colonialism: if Inuit communities prefer seal meat over tofu because of climate and culture, we need not say their preferences are non-autonomous\u2014the constraints are not dominance-producing.  Compared to purely historical but non-relational views, the emphasis on power explains why ordinary parental influence need not undermine autonomy while patriarchal indoctrination can.\n\nVIII.  Normative Implications\n\n1.  Policy.  The remedy for autonomy deficits lies not in substituting \u201cbetter\u201d preferences from outside but in dismantling illegitimate constraints and creating safe reflective space.  Micro-credit projects that also fund women\u2019s discussion circles do better than cash alone precisely because they chip away at H2.\n\n2.  Respect.  Calling a preference adaptive and non-autonomous is not an insult to the agent; it is a diagnosis of the environment.  The relational focus locates the disrespect where it belongs: in the structures that shrink evaluative possibility.\n\n3.  Measurement.  Development indices should supplement preference-satisfaction metrics with \u201cpreference-formation diagnostics\u201d\u2014indicators of informational freedom, deliberative inclusion, and exit options.  This operationalises autonomy in relational terms.\n\nIX.  Broader Theoretical Payoff: Recognitional Freedom\n\nUnderlying (H1) and (H2) is a more general notion: recognitional freedom\u2014the social pre-condition for agents to recognise reasons as reasons.  Adaptive preferences are autonomy-deficient when recognitional freedom is denied.  This reframes the debate: autonomy is not merely \u201cfreedom of the will\u201d but freedom of reason-seeing.  Oppression works by narrowing the set of considerations that can get a hearing in the agent\u2019s deliberation.  Once we see things this way, the puzzle of adaptive preferences dissolves: it is not mysterious that a will trained never to see certain options cannot count as fully free.\n\nThe historical-relational account thus supplies both a diagnostic tool and a philosophical insight: it makes explicit that autonomy is a relational achievement, not a purely internal accomplishment.

Introduction and Thesis\n\nImagine two women who both declare, sincerely and reflectively, that what they most want is to marry at fourteen and leave school. One lives in a rural district of Niger where early marriage is expected and secondary schooling for girls is all but unavailable; the other lives in Helsinki, where no such social pressure exists and first\u2010rate education is free. We are strongly inclined to say that the Nigerien girl\u2019s preference is not as fully her own as the Finn\u2019s, even if both avow it with equal conviction. The intuition persists even when we grant that the Nigerien girl has carefully considered her situation and currently endorses her desire. What, exactly, accounts for this deficit in autonomy?\n\nMy thesis is that the deficit is best explained by a historical account: a preference is non-autonomous when its formation (i) was shaped by social relations that systematically deprived the agent of opportunities for critical comparison of live alternatives and (ii) would, under a suitably specified counterfactual in which that deprivation was absent, be unlikely to arise or to withstand reflective scrutiny. Subjectivist \u201cendorsement\u201d models fail because endorsement can itself be the product of adaptive mechanisms, and content-based models fail because (a) morally objectionable preferences can sometimes be autonomous and (b) commendable preferences can lack autonomy if formed under domination. A power-sensitive, historically anchored account preserves what is compelling in the other two approaches while avoiding their pitfalls. I call this view the Power-Infused Historical-Procedural Account (PHPA).\n\nI proceed as follows. Section 2 clarifies the phenomenon of adaptive preference and the ideal of autonomy. Section 3 critiques Frankfurtian subjectivism; section 4 examines content-based proposals. Section 5 develops the PHPA and shows how it explains both the Nigerien case and harder edge cases. Section 6 responds to three significant objections. I conclude by sketching implications for policy and personal responsibility.\n\n2. Adaptive Preferences and Autonomy: Setting the Stage\n\n2.1 Adaptive preference. Amartya Sen and Jon Elster popularised the idea that human beings \u201cadapt\u201d their desires to what seems feasible, the way Aesop\u2019s fox judges the unreachable grapes sour. When the feasible set is narrowed by poverty, gender hierarchy, racism, or ableist norms, agents may come to prefer what serves those structures. The phenomenon can be prudentially rational\u2014preferring a chronic but manageable ailment to an unobtainable cure\u2014but it also raises a worry: such preferences seem less than fully ours. Call this the autonomy worry.\n\n2.2 Autonomy. For our purposes autonomy is self-governance: the capacity to form, revise, and act on a practical identity that is genuinely one\u2019s own. Three broad explanatory strategies dominate the literature.\n\na. Subjectivist/Procedural. What matters is not what one prefers but whether one endorses the preference under higher-order reflective scrutiny. (Frankfurt, Christman, Bratman.)\n\nb. Content-based/Substantive. Some preferences are autonomy-defeating because what they aim at\u2014servility, self-harm, domination\u2014is inconsistent with self-government. (Nussbaum, Dworkin 1988, standards of objective well-being.)\n\nc. Historical. A preference is autonomous only if its genealogy is free of certain distorting causal pathways\u2014coercion, manipulation, oppressive socialisation. (Meyers, Oshana, Friedman.)\n\nEach captures part of the phenomenon; none singly suffices. To see why, we must probe the Nigerien girl\u2019s case.\n\n3. Why Frankfurtian Endorsement Is Not Enough\n\nSuppose the Nigerien girl engages in an exercise of second-order reflection. She distinguishes her desire to marry early from her desire to become a teacher, recognises that the latter is virtually impossible, and wholeheartedly identifies with the former. On the canonical Frankfurt test, her preference is autonomous. Yet most of us are unconvinced, seeing her endorsement as itself adaptive. Why?\n\n3.1 The looping problem. Endorsement is subject to the same environmental conditioning as first-order desire. If oppressive constraints make marriage seem the only live path to social respect, the agent may authentically endorse the wish to marry precisely because of those constraints. Frankfurtian theory lacks resources to tell when endorsement is itself the product of domination rather than of self-governance. The problem is analogous to \u201cbrainwashing\u201d scenarios: wholeheartedness can be manufactured.\n\n3.2 The opacity of identification. Frankfurt\u2019s model licenses autonomy so long as no higher-order conflict arises. But many adaptive agents are not torn; their tranquility is part of the pathology. The very absence of conflict can signal successful internalisation of oppressive norms. Hence identification alone cannot mark autonomy.\n\n3.3 Procedural add-ons and their limits. Contemporary defenders (e.g., Christman) enrich the procedure with requirements of \u201ccompetence,\u201d \u201cfreedom from deception,\u201d and \u201cnon-alienating socialisation.\u201d This begins to look historical: we must know how the preference came about. Once the story turns to genealogy, plain proceduralism yields the explanatory job to historical conditions.\n\n4. The Attraction and Limits of Content-Based Tests\n\nPerhaps the problem is not endorsement but content: wanting early marriage (or foot-binding, or genital cutting) is inconsistent with flourishing or with equal moral standing, hence ipso facto non-autonomous.\n\n4.1 Qualitative traction. The content-based strategy rightly notes that autonomy is not only about process. Preferences that aim at one\u2019s subordination or bodily mutilation strike us as autonomy-suspect because they undermine the agent\u2019s status as a self-author. Servility is a standing insult to the self, however endorsed. This captures something real that proceduralists miss.\n\n4.2 Paternalist challenge. Still, content tests risk over-breadth and cultural imposition. Suppose a Zen monk in Kyoto endorses a life of humble service and vows of silence; a mountaineer voluntarily courts great bodily risk. These preferences violate no one else\u2019s rights yet conflict with many lists of objective goods. Are they non-autonomous? Intuitions diverge. Content criteria either slide into homogenising paternalism or retreat to vacuity.\n\n4.3 The inversion problem. Content tests can also misfire in the opposite direction: an outwardly admirable preference\u2014say, a desire for higher education\u2014may be non-autonomous if inculcated by intrusive tiger-parenting. So content, though not irrelevant, cannot do the full explanatory work.\n\n5. A Power-Infused Historical-Procedural Account (PHPA)\n\nHistorical views hold promise but need sharpening. Generic appeals to \u201ccoercion\u201d or \u201csocialisation\u201d capture too much\u2014every preference has a history\u2014and too little\u2014some histories involve benign influence. The task is to specify the kind of history that undermines self-governance.\n\n5.1 Two guiding ideas.\n\nA. Power asymmetry. Not all influence is autonomy-threatening; only influence that flows through social relations of power that systematically restrict the agent\u2019s ability to consider alternatives on terms of parity.\n\nB. Counterfactual reflectiveness. A preference is suspect if, in a realistic scenario in which the power asymmetry is absent and the agent has opportunities to explore alternatives without sanction, the preference would probably not emerge or would fail to survive reflection.\n\nCrucially, these conditions are diachronic and relational; they do not fixate on the preference\u2019s current content or the agent\u2019s momentary endorsement.\n\n5.2 Working definition. A preference P of an agent A is non-autonomous if and only if:\n\n(i) P originated and was sustained through social processes that (a) deprived A of adequate epistemic access to live alternatives or (b) imposed significant costs (material, relational, or symbolic) on critical assessment of those alternatives; and\n(ii) In a nearby possible world where those deprivations and costs are absent, A would, with non-negligible probability, withhold or withdraw reflective endorsement of P.\n\n5.3 Why PHPA explains the Nigerien case. The girl\u2019s social environment narrows her epistemic field: girls who pursue education face ostracism, financial ruin, and physical insecurity. Condition (i) obtains. Studies of first-generation scholarship programmes in similar regions show that when such constraints are lifted\u2014via stipends, secure boarding, and familial assurances\u2014many girls who once professed enthusiasm for early marriage revise their preferences. Thus (ii) is met, and the preference is autonomy-deficient.\n\n5.4 Explaining contrasts.\n\na. The Helsinki girl. Suppose she too marries at fourteen because she romanticises agrarian life. Yet she had access to robust schooling, legal protections, and a peer group that valorises continued education; she faced no sanction for delaying marriage. Condition (i) fails. Even if her choice seems unwise, it can be autonomous.\n\nb. The Zen monk. The vow of silence grows from a history of voluntary apprenticeship in an egalitarian monastic community. No asymmetrical power closed off alternatives; he periodically undertakes retreats where he is invited to reconsider. Condition (i) fails; autonomy is preserved.\n\nc. Foot-binding revival. Imagine a subculture that nostalgically revives foot-binding, marketing it as chic. If social media shaming discourages questioning the practice, condition (i) likely obtains, and the preference is suspect though the mover claims empowerment.\n\n5.5 Relationship to other accounts.\n\n\u2013 Incorporates procedural endorsement: PHPA grants authority to reflectively endorsed desires but insists that the availability of reflection be historically uncoerced.\n\n\u2013 Respects content intuitions indirectly: preferences expressive of servility often trace back to power-asymmetric histories, so PHPA explains why they raise red flags without declaring their content per se disqualifying.\n\n\u2013 Adds explanatory depth: only PHPA can systematically account for why some endorsed, self-harmful desires are autonomous (mountaineer) while others are not (foot-binding), by looking to formation history and structural power.\n\n6. Objections and Replies\n\nObjection 1: The epistemic-counterfactual test is too speculative; we cannot reliably know what someone would prefer under different social conditions.\n\nReply: Autonomy assessments are already counterfactual\u2014think of \u201chypothetical consent\u201d in political theory. PHPA mitigates speculation by demanding only non-negligible probability, established through comparative sociology, psychological studies, and pattern recognition. Courts already employ similar reasoning when invalidating contracts signed under duress. Moreover, the test is defeasible: uncertainty counsels humility, not paralysis.\n\nObjection 2: PHPA underestimates individual resilience. Some agents endorse adaptive preferences not because they are manipulated but because they find genuine meaning in conditions outsiders deem oppressive; PHPA risks erasing these voices.\n\nReply: Condition (ii) requires a significant likelihood of divergence when constraints lift, not inevitability. If empirical evidence shows that a stable minority persist in endorsing the preference after constraints are removed, PHPA allows that their desire may be autonomous. The account does not silence resilience; it locates it where it plausibly exists.\n\nObjection 3: The view re-introduces paternalism by letting third parties judge the adequacy of alternatives and the agent\u2019s reflective capacities.\n\nReply: Any autonomy standard must make judgments; the question is whether they are justified and reversible. PHPA\u2019s power criterion places the moral onus on those who maintain asymmetric structures, not on the agent. The test is symmetrical: if an emancipatory movement relies on manipulation and epistemic closure, its induced preferences would also fail. Finally, PHPA encourages procedural remedies\u2014expanding education, ensuring safe deliberative spaces\u2014over outright preference substitution.\n\n7. Policy and Responsibility Implications\n\nRecognising autonomy deficits grounded in power-laden histories shapes both social policy and moral evaluation.\n\n7.1 Structural intervention priority. Instead of nullifying adaptive choices (e.g., voiding early-marriage contracts wholesale), policy should first dismantle the power structures that generate adaptive endorsement\u2014invest in girls\u2019 schooling, enforce anti-violence laws, provide economic opportunities\u2014thereby enabling genuinely self-authored preference formation.\n\n7.2 Respect for transitional agency. While structures persist, agents still exercise bounded agency. PHPA distinguishes between rejecting existing choices (paternalism) and expanding the option set. Aid programmes should offer alternatives rather than forbid current preferences unless severe rights violations are at stake.\n\n7.3 Retrospective responsibility. If a preference is non-autonomous by PHPA lights, moral blame for actions based on it is mitigated, but not necessarily erased. Agents may have degrees of participatory responsibility, proportionate to their opportunities for critique within the oppressive context.\n\n8. Conclusion\n\nAdaptive preferences pose a genuine puzzle for theories of autonomy: they are preferences we can wholeheartedly endorse yet suspect of not being truly our own. Procedural subjectivism falters because endorsement itself can be bent by oppression; content-based views mislocate the deficit in the object of desire rather than in the oppressive relations that sculpt it. A historically oriented, power-infused procedural account explains the phenomenon with greater precision: a preference formed under epistemically and materially constraining power asymmetries, and unlikely to survive once those asymmetries are lifted, is less than fully autonomous. The account respects agents\u2019 voices while keeping social critique trained on structural power, charting a path between paternalism and relativism. If correct, it urges us to see autonomy not as a property of isolated choices but as an achievement of just social relations\u2014an achievement always provisional, always politically freighted, and always worth defending.", "output_tokens": 3311, "reasoning_tokens": 448}

The Puzzle  \n\nAn \u201cadaptive preference\u201d is one that bends to the agent\u2019s constrained option set. A woman who is barred from higher education and therefore comes to \u201cprefer\u201d leaving school at twelve; a member of an oppressed caste who \u201cprefers\u201d the menial work allotted to him; a long-term prisoner who \u201cprefers\u201d incarceration to the risks of liberty\u2014such cases tempt us to say that something in the preference itself is less than fully autonomous. Yet the very idea of autonomy, at least in liberal traditions, is that what ultimately authorizes the agent\u2019s choice is the agent herself, not an external yardstick. How, then, can we label some sincerely held preferences \u201cnot really mine\u201d without begging the question in favor of our own values? The literature has offered three broad strategies.  \n\n\u2022 Subjectivist: A preference is autonomous if the agent endorses it on reflection (\u00a7 2).  \n\u2022 Content-based: A preference is autonomous only if its content meets certain moral or prudential standards (\u00a7 3).  \n\u2022 Historical: A preference is autonomous only if it was formed through appropriate causal pathways (\u00a7 4).  \n\nI will defend a hybrid historical\u2013subjectivist view enriched by a counterfactual test. Roughly: a preference is non-autonomous to the degree that (i) it is traceable to oppressive constraints that systematically dampen the agent\u2019s imaginative grasp of alternatives and (ii) the agent would abandon it under conditions that remedied those constraints, even if the preference currently survives second-order endorsement. Content matters only indirectly, as evidence of such distortion. This hybrid both explains the autonomy deficit of paradigmatic adaptive preferences and avoids the pitfalls of its rivals.\n\n2. Why Pure Subjectivism Stumbles  \n\nHarry Frankfurt\u2019s hierarchical model is congenial to autonomy for it pours all normative weight into the agent\u2019s own internal endorsements. I act autonomously, on this view, when the desire that moves me is one I \u201cwant to want.\u201d So why not say that the rural Indian girl who prefers early marriage is autonomous the moment she joins in endorsing that preference?  \n\nTwo difficulties loom.\n\n2.1. The Regress of Endorsement Under Constraint  \nEndorsements themselves can be adaptive. If what counts as a \u201csecond-order\u201d desire is simply the strongest of my reflectively accessible motives, then oppression can colonize the higher order as easily as the first. An agent prevented from imagining a life of academic achievement may sincerely endorse her preference for domestic service. The very machinery Frankfurt invoked to guarantee self-authorship has been commandeered.\n\n2.2. The Missing Counterfactual Dimension  \nSubjectivism is a snapshot theory: it inspects the agent\u2019s psyche at a time. Yet our intuitions about adaptive preference turn on history and possibility\u2014on what the agent could have wanted in a less stunted environment. The prisoner who now prefers confinement would very likely revert if the option set widened and dignity were restored. By ignoring such modal facts, pure subjectivism misclassifies these preferences as fully autonomous.\n\nFrankfurtians have tried to reply that endorsement must be \u201cfree from coercion\u201d or \u201cfree from manipulation,\u201d but unless coercion is defined to include precisely the historical, structural forces now at issue, the addition is merely verbal. The work is being done outside the theory.\n\n3. The Trouble with Content Tests  \n\nMartha Nussbaum, David Crocker and others propose substantive \u201ccapability\u201d thresholds: a preference fails the autonomy test if it affirms a life beneath a certain objective level of functioning\u2014e.g., literacy, bodily integrity, political participation. Such accounts have the intuitive virtue of condemning the widow who \u201cprefers\u201d sati or the sweatshop worker who \u201cprefers\u201d hazardous labor. But they face three objections.\n\n3.1. Liberal Worry: Paternalism  \nIf autonomy is equated with living up to an external list, then disagreement with that list becomes ipso facto evidence of heteronomy. The view risks converting moral disapproval into a verdict on self-authorship\u2014undermining the very respect for persons that autonomy was designed to protect.\n\n3.2. The Possibility of Innocent Adaptation  \nNot all adaptive preferences are suspect. A backpacker stranded in a storm who comes to prefer a humble hut to a luxurious hotel exhibits an adaptive preference, but one that seems fully autonomous: it is a rational accommodation to changed circumstances. Content theories cannot easily explain why adaptation under injustice is corrupting while adaptation under natural misfortune is not.\n\n3.3. The Problem of False Positives  \nA person might favor a life that meets every capability threshold\u2014say, a middle-class citizen who prefers quiet domesticity over political engagement\u2014yet do so for reasons traceable to distorting oppression (e.g., internalized misogyny). Content theories would wrongly declare the preference autonomous.\n\nIn short, content tests smuggle in contentious moral criteria, misfire on benign adaptations, and miss hidden oppression.\n\n4. Historical Theories and Their Promise  \n\nHistorically oriented accounts, inspired by Robert Adams, James Stacey Taylor, and Marina Oshana, shift the spotlight to the causal story of preference formation. A preference is autonomous if it was not produced by alien control, manipulation, or oppressive socialization. This move captures an important grain: autonomy is a temporally extended achievement. It also avoids paternalism; one need not inspect the content of the preference to judge its pedigree.\n\nStill, familiar formulations encounter two gaps.\n\n4.1. The Scope of Oppression  \nWhat counts as \u201calien control\u201d? Direct brainwashing surely qualifies, but adaptive preferences typically arise from diffuse social pressures\u2014gender norms, stereotypes, material deprivation. Unless the historical test is sensitive to these \u201csoft\u201d forces, it will under-diagnose autonomy deficits.\n\n4.2. The Normativity of Distance  \nSuppose a woman\u2019s preference for housewifery stems partly from patriarchal upbringing but she later critically reflects, studies feminist texts, and still endorses it. Has the historical taint been cleansed? Historical purists risk an all-or-nothing verdict (once tainted, always tainted) or else collapse back into subjectivism.\n\n5. A Hybrid, Counterfactual Proposal  \n\nI propose a two-stage account:\n\nStage 1 (Etiology): A preference is prima facie suspect if its formation process involved (a) systematic limitation of the agent\u2019s epistemic access to alternative ways of living, (b) social meanings that devalue the agent\u2019s status, and (c) incentives that make compliance appear the only viable path to respect or basic subsistence.\n\nStage 2 (Counterfactual Endorsement): The preference is non-autonomous to the degree that, were those epistemic and material constraints lifted for a reasonable period, the agent would likely revise or abandon it after critical reflection with full information. \n\nAutonomy here is not assessed at a moment but across nearby possible worlds\u2014worlds where the obstacles that made the preference adaptive are absent. Concretely, imagine offering the oppressed garment worker an education grant, economic security for her family during the transition, and exposure to role models. If under those conditions she still prefers garment work, the preference passes the test; if not, it fails.\n\nThe core intuition: oppression is autonomy-impairing because it distorts the agent\u2019s deliberative field, not necessarily because the resulting preference has objectionable content or lacks current endorsement. The counterfactual element preserves the central liberal idea that the agent\u2019s own evaluative perspective is decisive\u2014only we consult the perspective she would hold were she not artificially stunted. Meanwhile, the etiological screen distinguishes harmful from benign adaptation: the backpacker\u2019s hut preference survives because nature, not injustice, restricted his horizons, and the counterfactual world (fair weather) would leave his preference for inexpensive huts intact.\n\n6. How the Hybrid Outscores Its Rivals  \n\n6.1. Answering the Subjectivist  \nSubjectivism is absorbed but refined. Endorsement remains necessary, yet it must survive modal scrutiny. Endorsements forged in a furnace of oppressive constraint are provisional; they can be overturned by the agent herself once the furnace cools.\n\n6.2. Improving on Content Tests  \nThe view never asks whether domesticity, factory work, or veiling is intrinsically unworthy. It instead asks whether the agent could maintain that preference from a position of equal civic, epistemic, and material standing. This rescues autonomy from the quicksand of paternalism, allowing that in some worlds the agent might autonomously choose the very life outsiders disdain.\n\n6.3. Deepening Historical Accounts  \nHistory matters because it determines which counterfactuals are relevant. A preference formed through indoctrination might nonetheless persist even when indoctrination ends; think of a converted mystic who, after liberation, still values her meditative life. On my view, such persistence suffices for autonomy. Thus, historical taint is neither indelible nor irrelevant; it supplies the \u201ccontrast class\u201d of worlds against which endorsement is tested.\n\n7. Illustrative Cases  \n\nCase 1: Khader\u2019s Bangladeshi Garment Worker  \n\u201cShathi\u201d prefers factory labor to domestic service despite low wages and poor conditions. Etiology: limited education, dowry pressures. Offer her a living stipend and evening classes. In most empirical studies (e.g., S. Alkire 2008), women so empowered rerank options toward skilled trades or continued education. Shathi\u2019s original preference therefore fails counterfactual endorsement, signaling an autonomy deficit\u2014just as our intuitions suggest.\n\nCase 2: The Prisoner-Turned-Monk  \nAfter 20 years, \u201cLuis\u201d obtains parole but asks to remain incarcerated because he has built a monastic routine. Suppose the state could grant the same routine\u2014silence, study, vegan meals\u2014outside prison walls with no loss of security. If, offered that, Luis still prefers the cell because it symbolizes penance, the preference passes; its persistence indicates that the original carceral constraints are no longer driving it. Many will find this verdict plausible: Luis may have forged an authentic vocation.\n\nCase 3: The Backpacker\u2019s Hut  \nAlready discussed: the preference arose from natural misfortune, not oppression; the counterfactual world (storm dissipates) may or may not alter the preference, but either way the case scores as autonomous.\n\nNotice how the same template discriminates intuitively among diverse scenarios without appealing to controversial moral rankings of activities.\n\n8. Objections and Replies  \n\nObjection 1: The \u201cWould\u201d Counterfactual Is Epistemically Inaccessible  \n\u201cHow,\u201d the skeptic asks, \u201ccan we possibly know what the agent would prefer in a liberated world?\u201d Reply: We do not need omniscience, only defeasible evidence\u2014experimental interventions, testimony of similarly situated agents who later escaped oppression, qualitative studies of preference shifts after social change. Democratic deliberation and participatory development projects already rely on such evidence. No theory of autonomy can avoid fallible judgment; mine at least directs inquiry to the right comparative data.\n\nObjection 2: Some Agents May Embrace Oppression Even in Freedom  \nTrue. Internalized subordination can persist. My account allows that such deep-seated preferences count as autonomous if they withstand enhanced capacity and critical reflection. This may seem to exculpate oppression too readily. But autonomy and justice are different virtues: a society can owe redress for past wrongs even to persons who now autonomously prefer the status quo. Conflating the two moral registers blurs our normative vision.\n\nObjection 3: Natural Constraints Can Also Stunt Imagination  \nSuppose geographical isolation, not injustice, limited options. Would that not similarly distort deliberation? The hybrid view can accommodate the point: what matters is whether the constraints are \u201cremediable by social action\u201d (Sen). If a community could, at reasonable cost, provide exposure or information but fails to, the constraint becomes socially inflicted and folds back into Stage 1.\n\nObjection 4: Isn\u2019t This Just Idealized Preference Satisfaction?  \nNo, because the counterfactual is not idealized to full omniscience or perfect rationality; only to the removal of specific oppressive barriers. The agent\u2019s culturally located values, quirks, even mistakes may survive\u2014and rightly so, for they are part of what makes the choice hers.\n\n9. Philosophical Payoffs  \n\n9.1. Preserving Respect for Persons  \nBy reserving final authority to the agent\u2019s own potential judgment, the view honors autonomy while still diagnosing oppression\u2019s corrosive effects.\n\n9.2. Clarifying Development Policy  \nDevelopment economists debate whether to rely on preference surveys when measuring welfare. My account advises a two-step protocol: (i) identify likely adaptive domains (education for girls, political expression, etc.), then (ii) test whether preferences remain once practical and informational constraints are eased. Only then may preference data act as a welfare proxy.\n\n9.3. Reconciling Liberal and Feminist Insights  \nLiberals stress self-legislation; feminists stress the social construction of desires. The hybrid model respects both: the social origin of a preference matters because it affects (and can undermine) the agent\u2019s own eventual legislative capacities.\n\n10. Conclusion  \n\nAdaptive preferences are autonomy-impaired not simply because their content is unworthy or because the agent now fails to endorse them, but because they are products of histories that truncate the agent\u2019s imaginative horizon and practical agency. A purely subjectivist account cannot tell when endorsement is itself detuned by oppression; a purely content-based account paternalistically substitutes external values; a purely historical account lacks the resources to determine when the taint has been overcome. The counterfactual-historical hybrid offered here secures what is attractive in each approach while avoiding their defects.\n\nPut metaphorically, autonomy is not a photograph but a film. We judge whether the plot of an agent\u2019s desire could survive a version of the story from which the censor\u2019s scissors\u2014the blades of stigma, poverty, and coercion\u2014have been removed. When it can, the preference is her own; when it cannot, the deficit is laid bare. Recognizing this equips both philosophers and policymakers with a principled yet non-paternalistic lens through which to view the quiet tragedies of adaptive preference\u2014and perhaps, to begin their repair.", "output_tokens": 3334, "reasoning_tokens": 320}

Setting the Problem\n\nImagine a young Dalit woman in rural Uttar Pradesh who tells the visiting researcher, without hesitation, that she does not wish to finish school. She \u201creally wants\u201d to marry at sixteen, to work in the fields, and to raise children. Her peers who have migrated to Delhi as domestic workers, she insists, are \u201ctoo modern\u201d and \u201clive like servants.\u201d The conversation feels tragic. On the one hand, the preference is emphatically hers: no one is coercing her, and she reaffirms it even after hearing about alternative lives. On the other hand, we suspect something has gone awry. What looks like an expression of self-rule appears instead to mirror the restricted horizons of caste, gender, and poverty. The notion of adaptive preference\u2014first developed by Sen and Elster to describe desires \u201cpruned to fit\u201d narrow opportunity sets\u2014labels the phenomenon. But the conceptual challenge remains: precisely why, and in virtue of what, are such preferences less than fully autonomous?\n\nI will defend the following thesis:\n\nHistorical\u2010relational accounts, which evaluate a preference by tracing the social processes that shaped it and asking whether those processes were instances of domination, best explain the autonomy deficit of adaptive preferences. Subjectivist endorsement accounts misfire by treating wholehearted acceptance as sufficient, while content-based accounts misfire by making autonomy hostage to substantive moral agreement. A revised historical view\u2014call it the \u201cCounterfactual Competence Model\u201d\u2014captures what is defective in adaptive preferences without collapsing into perfectionism or paternalism.\n\nThe argument proceeds in five steps. Section 2 clarifies the target phenomenon and distinguishes three families of autonomy accounts. Section 3 critiques subjectivist theories; Section 4 critiques content-based theories. Section 5 elaborates and improves the historical-relational approach and shows how it illuminates paradigmatic cases of oppression. Section 6 answers several objections and shows why the proposal does not overreach. I close in Section 7 by gesturing to research avenues the model opens.\n\n2. Mapping the Terrain\n\n2.1 Two Kinds of Constraint\n\nAdaptive preference literature sometimes blurs two mechanisms. Type-A adaptation is hedonic: one lowers expectations to avoid frustration (\u201csour grapes\u201d). Type-B adaptation is socialization: one internalizes a restrictive norm, so that options outside the permitted set never register as live. Both erode autonomy, but for different reasons. I focus on Type-B because it is the core worry in oppression cases.\n\n2.2 Three Families of Autonomy Accounts\n\na. Subjectivist (Procedural) Accounts  \nThe agent is autonomous when her higher-order volitions *endorse* her first-order desires (Frankfurt), or when her preference set is integrated and reflectively wholehearted (Dworkin). Autonomy is a matter of intra-psychic structure, independent of content or origin.\n\nb. Content-Based (Perfectionist) Accounts  \nAutonomy requires valuing certain things (capabilities for practical reason, bodily integrity, etc.) or avoiding certain ends (slavery, self-destruction). A preference for genital cutting or child marriage is non-autonomous because its object is inherently autonomy-undermining (Nussbaum, Raz).\n\nc. Historical-Relational Accounts  \nThe pedigree of a preference matters. Preferences formed through manipulation, coercion, or oppressive socialization lack autonomy, even if the agent presently endorses them and their content is innocuous (Christman, Friedman, Oshana). What counts is whether the formative process left the agent \u201ccompetence-undermined\u201d\u2014unable to assess alternatives under non-dominating conditions.\n\n3. Why Subjectivism Fails: The Problem of *Wholehearted Oppression*\n\nReturn to the Dalit woman. Suppose she is Frankfurt-autonomous: she wants to want early marriage and would resist counter-indoctrination. Subjectivism would pronounce the preference autonomous. Yet the pervasive background of caste patriarchy\u2014from textbooks that portray girls as household help, to parents who reward docility\u2014has never allowed her the cognitive or experiential resources to imagine university or a salaried job as genuine options. Most of us still judge her autonomy compromised, for reasons that have nothing to do with second-order ambivalence.\n\nThree deeper problems plague subjectivism:\n\n1. Transparency Problem: Victims of adaptive preference often *experience* wholeheartedness precisely because oppressive socialization has erased competing desires. The very data the theory uses to certify autonomy are manufactured by domination.\n\n2. Modal Narrowness: Autonomy plausibly involves the capacity to respond to *reasons one could come to have* under improved epistemic conditions. A purely synchronic endorsement test ignores this diachronic, counterfactual dimension.\n\n3. Normative Blindness: Subjectivism cannot distinguish between brainwashed cultists and freely chosen ascetics when both are wholehearted. Yet our intuitions, and liberal political practice, treat the former as autonomy deficits needing redress.\n\nAttempts to patch subjectivism\u2014e.g., requiring \u201cauthenticity-conditioned self-creation\u201d or \u201cprocedural independence\u201d\u2014either smuggle in historical considerations or collapse into the historical view I will champion.\n\n4. Why Content-Based Views Misfire: The Paternalism Dilemma\n\nContent-based views fare better in explaining our disquiet: early marriage genuinely truncates life plans. Still, they stumble on two horns.\n\nFirst, the Liberal Horn. If autonomy requires endorsing a roster of liberal goods, then devout monks who freely choose lives of obedience are declared non-autonomous. The account becomes intolerant of *different but non-dominating* forms of life.\n\nSecond, the Epistemic Horn. Suppose an oppressed woman declares that domestic work is \u201cdignified\u201d and paid employment outside the village is \u201cshameful.\u201d Is it the *content* of preferring domesticity that is autonomy-reducing, or the way the preference was *produced*? If she arrived at the same preference after informed reflection and real opportunity, we would hesitate to say her autonomy suffers. So content alone cannot do the explanatory work; history sneaks back in.\n\nRaz and Nussbaum try to soften perfectionism by appealing to \u201ccore capabilities\u201d any rational agent would value. But core lists are contestable, culturally loaded, and politically potent: they authorize intrusions into communities that reject them. We should avoid building controversial moral criteria into the *concept* of autonomy.\n\n5. The Historical-Relational Solution\n\n5.1 Basic Idea\n\nA preference is autonomous iff:\n\nH1. Formation Independence: It was not produced by processes that bypass the agent\u2019s critical faculties under conditions of domination (manipulation, indoctrination, deprivation of information).\n\nH2. Counterfactual Competence: The agent would still endorse the preference after engaging in minimally competent reflection in a social context offering (a) credible alternative models, (b) relevant information, and (c) freedom from sanction for dissent.\n\nIf either condition fails, autonomy is reduced proportionally to the deficit.\n\n5.2 Why This Explains Adaptive Preference Pathology\n\nAdaptive preferences in oppressive contexts typically fail H1: caste and gender norms saturate childhood training, making the eventual preference a direct causal product of domination. They also fail H2: when researchers provide information about labor laws or scholarship programs, many women *revise* their aspirations. The modal fragility of endorsement under improved conditions signals non-autonomy. Content and synchronic endorsement are now explicable: we treat the preference as suspect not because of what it is (marriage, motherhood) or how earnestly it is held, but because of *how we came to find ourselves holding it*.\n\n5.3 The Counterfactual Competence Model in Action\n\nCase 1: The Dalit Woman  \nUnder a six-month program offering stipends, legal education, and immersion with college-educated female mentors, 70% of participants opt to remain in school. The high revision rate triggers an autonomy alarm: their earlier preference was competence-undermined.\n\nCase 2: The Benedictine Novice  \nBrother Thomas, raised in a pluralist society with abundant exit options, completes a two-year discernment period and re-endorses monastic vows. Historical scrutiny shows no coercive indoctrination; counterfactual endorsement holds. His preference is autonomous even though it resembles, in content, oppressive self-renunciation.\n\nCase 3: The Stockholm Hostage  \nPost-rescue therapy reveals that most hostages abandon their captors\u2019 ideology once safe. Counterfactual endorsement fails dramatically; H1 is violated via psychological coercion. The theory explains why \u201cidentification with the kidnapper\u201d lacks autonomy despite genuine emotional attachment.\n\n5.4 Distinctive Advantages\n\na. Agent-Respecting: The model diagnoses deficits without dictating substantive values. What matters is whether the agent *could have* arrived at a different view under non-dominating circumstances, not whether we approve of the view she did arrive at.\n\nb. Degree-Sensitive: Autonomy comes in degrees; slight informational deficits lower autonomy slightly, severe oppression lowers it drastically. This tracks moral intuition better than all-or-nothing accounts.\n\nc. Policy Guidance: Interventions should target *conditions of competence* (education, information, exit options), not impose specific ends. Thus the model justifies anti-oppression policies while avoiding perfectionist paternalism.\n\n6. Objections and Replies\n\nObjection 1: ubiquity. Nobody\u2019s preferences form in a social vacuum; everyone fails H1 to some extent. Does the model collapse into skepticism?\n\nReply: The criterion is *domination-sensitive*, not social-influence-free. Socialization is autonomy-reducing only when it systematically blocks the agent\u2019s capacity for critical assessment\u2014when she cannot *challenge* inherited norms without material or psychological penalty. Ordinary cultural influence leaves the challenge route open; oppressive influence shuts it down. The threshold is demanding yet attainable, as the Benedictine case shows.\n\nObjection 2: Epistemic Inaccessibility. How can we know whether H2\u2014the counterfactual endorsement\u2014would hold? Isn\u2019t the test speculative?\n\nReply: Autonomy assessments are already predictive (e.g., in informed-consent law). We rely on indicators: revision rates after exposure to information, consistency of endorsement across contexts, presence of coercive threats, availability of exit. Imperfect but workable. Analogous assessments guide mental-competence rulings in courts.\n\nObjection 3: Value Relativism. If content never matters, could a preference for slavery pass H1 and H2?\n\nReply: Unlikely. Voluntarily choosing personal slavery is almost always tied to social processes that fail H1 or H2: misinformation about alternatives, internalized inferiority, coercion, or absence of exit. Should an empirically bizarre case meet both criteria\u2014say, a science-fiction scenario where an adult in a utopia chooses slavery after informed deliberation\u2014respect for autonomy may indeed counsel toleration. That conclusion, though unsettling, marks the boundary between autonomy and morality; the latter may still condemn the choice.\n\nObjection 4: Practical Paternalism. Policies aimed at altering conditions of competence (e.g., mandatory schooling) are still paternalistic.\n\nReply: The relevant distinction is between *opportunity-expanding* and *preference-imposing* paternalism. Providing education, information, or exit subsidies enlarges feasible sets and improves deliberative conditions without dictating outcomes. The model licenses only the former.\n\n7. Conclusion and Future Work\n\nAdaptive preferences expose a deep lesson: autonomy is a temporally extended, socially scaffolded achievement, not a momentary psychological state or a moral property of ends. Subjectivist accounts mislocate autonomy in present-time endorsement; content-based accounts mislocate it in the object of desire. Historical-relational accounts locate it, plausibly, in the interaction between an agent\u2019s diachronic deliberative capacities and her social environment. Strengthening that environment\u2014by dismantling domination and fostering what I have called counterfactual competence\u2014does not paternalistically replace her will but rather *secures* the conditions under which a will can truly be her own.\n\nThe Counterfactual Competence Model suggests three research programs:\n\n1. Empirical Autonomy Metrics: Develop longitudinal studies that measure preference stability under de-dominating interventions, refining indicators for H1 and H2.\n\n2. Diachronic Rights: Recast certain socio-economic rights (education, media pluralism, mobility) as autonomy-enabling rather than welfare-optimizing, thereby grounding them in a universal interest in self-rule.\n\n3. Reparative Justice: Examine whether societies that have historically produced competence-undermined preferences owe special obligations to provide de-dominating environments to the affected groups.\n\nThe philosophical payoff is a notion of autonomy that honors both liberal respect for individual choice and feminist insight into the power of oppressive socialization. By tying autonomy to the historical conditions that cultivate (or stunt) competent agency, we gain a framework robust enough to condemn adaptive preferences born of oppression, yet liberal enough to respect unconventional but freely chosen lives.", "output_tokens": 3324, "reasoning_tokens": 576}

Introduction and Thesis\n\nImagine two women who profess to \u201cprefer\u201d marrying at fourteen. The first lives in an affluent liberal society and, having surveyed a wide field of alternatives, wants an early wedding because she is exhilarated by the prospect of devoting her twenties to child-rearing. The second inhabits a rural district in which girls who refuse early marriage lose social standing, confront economic destitution, and invite family violence. Though both women voice the same preference, only the second strikes us as lacking full autonomy; her preference feels adaptive\u2014a coping mechanism forged under constraint. What explains the deficit?  \n\nI shall argue that historical-relational accounts, when refined to incorporate a counterfactual test for domination in preference formation, best diagnose the non-autonomy of adaptive preferences, especially in oppressive contexts. Subjectivist endorsement models misfire because reflection can itself be colonised by constraint; content-based models conflate autonomy with the moral worth of what is preferred; but an historically sensitive approach that asks whether the agent could have formed the preference under conditions free of domination captures what bothers us without collapsing into paternalism. I end by sketching a \u201cdiachronic non-domination\u201d principle that distinguishes benign accommodation from autonomy-undermining adaptation.\n\n2. Adaptive Preferences and the Structure of Autonomy\n\nSen coined \u201cadaptive preferences\u201d for the phenomenon in which people adjust what they want to what they can get. The worry is not adaptation per se\u2014Stoic tranquillity, aestheticizing prison walls, or training one\u2019s palate to affordable food can be rational\u2014but the suspicion that some adaptations track deprivation rather than deliberation, resignation rather than authorship. That suspicion is usually cast in terms of autonomy, the condition in which one\u2019s will is genuinely one\u2019s own.\n\nThree families of autonomy theories dominate contemporary debate:\n\na. Subjectivist or structural accounts: exemplified by Frankfurt, they locate autonomy in a structural relation between higher-order and first-order desires. If, after critical reflection, I identify with wanting X, X is autonomous for me, regardless of its content or history.  \n\nb. Content-based or substantive accounts: advocated by perfectionists such as Raz and, more guardedly, Nussbaum, they hold that certain desires cannot be autonomous because of what they aim at\u2014e.g., craving servility.  \n\nc. Historical accounts: advanced by Christman, Oshana, and Benson, they place weight on the causal story behind a desire, asking whether its formation was marred by manipulation, coercion, or oppressive socialisation.\n\nMy strategy is dialectical: probe a paradigm case of adaptive preference\u2014the rural girl who \u201cwants\u201d early marriage\u2014and test which theory gives the best explanation of her autonomy deficit.\n\n3. Testing Subjectivist Endorsement\n\nFrankfurtian autonomy requires wholehearted identification with a first-order desire. Suppose the girl, after nights of sincere reflection, feels no ambivalence; she thinks early marriage is her best, indeed only, avenue to security and respect. By Frankfurt\u2019s lights, that wholeheartedness suffices for autonomy. But our intuition balks: her reflection is circumscribed by lack of alternatives, imaginative horizons narrowed by patriarchal norms, and threats of ostracism. Endorsement here is too cheap.\n\nA defender of subjectivism may retort that Frankfurt\u2019s model was never meant to ignore the quality of reflection; the girl\u2019s deliberation is distorted by fear and misinformation, vitiating wholeheartedness. Yet the theory supplies no internal metric for what counts as \u201cdistortion.\u201d Unless we import an external standard\u2014absence of coercion, availability of options, epistemic access\u2014the model cannot distinguish her case from the affluent woman\u2019s.\n\nAnother subjectivist manoeuvre is procedural enrichment: require that identification emerge from appropriately reasons-responsive processes (say, reflectively accessible evidence about alternative life plans). This move, however, effectively migrates the account into the historical family, because it now matters how the process was socially scaffolded. In short, subjectivists either (i) stick to bare endorsement and misclassify adaptive preferences as autonomous, or (ii) smuggle in historical criteria and become historical theorists in disguise.\n\n4. The Lure and Limits of Content-Based Diagnoses\n\nContent theorists propose a simpler diagnosis: the girl\u2019s preference is non-autonomous because it endorses a life plan objectively inimical to human flourishing\u2014early marriage truncates education, bodily integrity, and political agency. Nussbaum speaks of \u201cincomplete preferences\u201d that fall short of species-wide human capabilities.\n\nThe attraction is obvious: it matches our moral revulsion without intricate psychological inquiry. Yet problems loom:\n\na. Paternalism. If autonomy is denied whenever an agent\u2019s ends violate an objective list, then ascetic monks, extreme athletes, or terminally ill patients refusing treatment risk having their agency discounted. We slide from saying the choice is bad to saying the chooser is not really choosing\u2014a category mistake.  \n\nb. Dissociation between morality and autonomy. Someone can autonomously elect wicked ends (consider a reflective white supremacist), and someone can be forced into laudable ends (a conscripted rescuer). Autonomy and moral worth diverge; conflating them blurs critical dimensions of responsibility.\n\nc. Explaining the deficit. Content accounts say what is wrong with the chosen life, not why the choosing is non-autonomous. That explanatory mismatch becomes salient when we meet oppressive content that is embraced after resistance collapses (syndromes of capture), versus the same content voluntarily accepted by a fully informed ascetic. The moral quality is constant, but autonomy varies.\n\nHence, content considerations may ground a reason to resist adaptive preferences, yet they fail to illuminate the autonomy question itself.\n\n5. Historical-Relational Analysis: Initial Advantages\n\nHistorical theories begin where the others stumble: by scrutinising the genesis of desires. Christman\u2019s \u201chypothetical reflection\u201d test asks whether the agent would have repudiated the preference under conditions of full information and absent manipulation. Oshana stresses ongoing relations of social power: autonomy demands that one stand in relations of non-subjection to other agents.\n\nApplied to the early-marriage case, the historical story is unflattering: patriarchal norms, economic dependence, honour killings, and truncated education converge to channel girls toward seeing early marriage as natural. These forces exert not just external pressure but shape the motivational landscape\u2014what Elster termed \u201csour grapes\u201d mechanisms and Jon Barnett calls \u201cpreference deformation.\u201d Because the preference would likely evaporate if the girl enjoyed economic security, legal protection, and expanded horizons, it fails the historical test and registers as non-autonomous.\n\nTwo virtues recommend the historical approach:\n\n1. It preserves the conceptual independence of autonomy from morality. If the same early marriage preference emerged through non-coercive, non-manipulative processes\u2014imagine a utopia where girls explore all options and still choose early wedlock\u2014it could be autonomous though we might still deem it suboptimal.  \n\n2. It accounts for the role of social power. Autonomy is not merely a property of internal psychology; it is relational, embedding agents within networks of domination or equality. Adaptive preferences formed under structural oppression epitomise relational unfreedom.\n\n6. Refining the Historical View: Diachronic Non-Domination\n\nStill, stock historical accounts face two objections.\n\nFirst, benign adaptation cases. A prisoner learning to enjoy prison gardening arguably forms that preference in response to coercive circumstances, yet we hesitate to brand it non-autonomous; adaptation can be rational coping. Second, indeterminacy. How distant must the counterfactual world be? If autonomy requires that a preference survive in a fully just world, almost every actual preference might fail, because justice transforms incentive structures radically.\n\nI propose a refinement: A preference is autonomy-undermining if and only if (i) its formation involved ongoing relations of domination\u2014power asymmetries that permit arbitrary interference in the agent\u2019s preference formation\u2014and (ii) in a nearby counterfactual scenario where such domination is absent while other background conditions (culture, personal temperament) remain, the agent would not hold that preference. Call this the Diachronic Non-Domination (DND) test.\n\nThe DND test filters out benign adaptation: the prisoner\u2019s love of gardening may pass because the preference would survive once the prison\u2019s coercive atmosphere is lifted; gardening is not essentially bound up with domination. By contrast, the rural girl\u2019s preference would likely evaporate once patriarchal threats are removed, failing DND.\n\n7. Relational Domination: Beyond Coercion and Deception\n\nCentral to DND is the idea of domination rather than momentary coercion. Domination, as Pettit articulates it, is the capacity of one party to arbitrarily interfere with another. In many oppressive settings, direct coercion need not be exercised because the dominated internalise expected sanctions. Thus, even \u201cvoluntary\u201d early marriage is shadowed by the latent threat of honour violence. Historical accounts sensitive to domination capture this subtle but potent mechanism.\n\nMoreover, domination operates not only through threats but also through epistemic deprivation. When schooling is withheld, when female role models are silenced, when legal knowledge is inaccessible, the resulting imaginative poverty biases preference formation. These epistemic constraints qualify as arbitrary interference in the generative phase of desire, triggering DND.\n\n8. Engaging Objections\n\nObjection 1: Relational histories ignore first-person authority; they patronise by declaring people inauthentic. Reply: DND preserves authority over present preferences; what it segments is causal pedigree, not the agent\u2019s current endorsement. Recognising the autonomy deficit does not license coercive intervention\u2014it motivates expanding the agent\u2019s horizon so that future preferences can wrest free from domination.\n\nObjection 2: Historical tests are empirically intractable; we cannot know how someone would prefer under non-dominating conditions. Reply: While perfect knowledge is elusive, social science provides robust indicators: correlations between economic independence and delayed marriage, cross-cultural studies showing that when legal protections rise, adaptive preferences wane, etc. Autonomy is not an all-or-nothing metaphysical status; it admits degrees inferred from evidence.\n\nObjection 3: Some preferences, once formed, become identity-constituting. If the rural girl cannot imagine a dignified life without early marriage, stripping her preference of autonomy disrespects her agency. Reply: The charge conflates respecting persons with valorising every preference. We can value her current projects while acknowledging the unjust path that installed them and working to create alternative futures she might come to value more. Indeed, treating her as an agent requires furnishing the material and discursive resources for genuine choice.\n\n9. Distinguishing Benign from Malign Adaptation\n\nA conceptual gain of DND is that it discriminates between three categories:\n\na. Rational Cushioning: preferences formed to mitigate hardship but independent of domination (liking prison gardening, developing desert aesthetics).  \n\nb. Collaborative Adjustment: preferences formed through negotiation among equals (compromise within marriages, cultural fusions among migrants).  \n\nc. Oppressive Deformation: preferences inculcated by structural domination (internalised racism, servility, self-effacement in class hierarchies).\n\nOnly (c) registers as autonomy-deficient. The decisive marker is the presence of arbitrary, asymmetrical power shaping desire formation, not mere scarcity, cultural influence, or prudential coping.\n\n10. Examples That Do Work\n\nConsider appetite adaptation among food-insecure populations. Parents who come to \u201cprefer\u201d eating less so their children can eat more pass DND: though scarcity prompts the preference, no dominating party arbitrarily interferes. Compare this with enslaved persons who internalised a preference for subservience to avoid punishment; domination is manifest, and the preference would dissipate in a non-slaveholding environment, failing DND.\n\nA striking contemporary case is gig-economy workers who declare they \u201cprefer\u201d algorithmic piece-work over secure employment because they prize \u201cflexibility.\u201d Studies show that many such workers, when offered stable contracts at decent wages, switch eagerly. Their proclaimed preference is shaped by the domination of capital that sets the terms of platform labour; DND diagnoses autonomy deficits that economic rhetoric obfuscates.\n\n11. Policy Implications of the Historical Diagnosis\n\nIf autonomy deficits track domination histories rather than mere content, interventions should aim at dismantling oppressive structures and expanding capabilities, not paternalistically overriding choices. For early marriage, this means scholarships, safe-houses, legal protection, and public narratives celebrating alternative life stories. Provide the counterfactual conditions, then see whether the preference persists. Respectful social engineering, not coercive bans, aligns with autonomy promotion.\n\n12. Relation to Feminist Critiques and Informal Economies\n\nFeminist theorists like Catriona Mackenzie emphasise \u201csocially scaffolded practical identity.\u201d DND operationalises this in autonomy terms: it is the scaffold\u2019s domination content that matters. In informal economies, women often \u201cprefer\u201d hazardous home-based labour over factory jobs. Historical analysis reveals that lack of safe transport and harassment in public spaces dominate preference formation. Installing safe transit routes and anti-harassment policing may prompt genuine preference re-evaluation without top-down bans on home labour.\n\n13. Why Subjectivist and Content Accounts Must Be Supplemented\n\nThe DND framework does not discard reflection or content; rather, it nests them within history. Reflective endorsement is necessary to gauge present identification, and content analysis signals moral stakes, but neither suffices to explain autonomy deficits without the historical-relational middle term. Adaptive preferences in oppressive contexts are deficient not because agents fail to endorse them or because the ends are substantively bad, but because the causal pathway by which endorsement crystallised is pervaded by domination that blocks meaningful alternatives.\n\n14. Conclusion\n\nAdaptive preferences trouble us when they are artifacts of oppression, not merely because they reflect suboptimal ends or insufficient introspection. Subjectivist models underplay social power; content-based models conflate moral criticism with autonomy assessment. A refined historical-relational account, articulated through the Diachronic Non-Domination test, captures the intuitive deficit: such preferences would not survive the removal of dominating formative conditions that arbitrarily narrowed the agent\u2019s horizon. Recognising this helps us craft interventions that respect agency while dismantling domination, enabling people to want under circumstances worthy of their status as free and equal co-authors of their lives.", "output_tokens": 3574, "reasoning_tokens": 576}

Philosophers puzzle over why such preferences seem to lack full authority over the agents who hold them.  After all, autonomy normally requires that an action or preference be \u201cone\u2019s own.\u201d  In adaptive-preference cases the preference is sincerely endorsed, often brings psychological satisfaction, and sometimes is even rational in a narrow sense (if you cannot reach the grapes, resenting them wastes resources).  Yet many of us feel that something is wrong: the preference does not simply record the agent\u2019s values but is deformed by background injustice.  What exactly accounts for this autonomy deficit?\n\nI will argue for a historical\u2013relational explanation.  The decisive fact is not merely that the agent presently endorses the preference (subjectivist view) nor that the preference\u2019s content is morally tainted (content view).  Rather, the preference was produced and is sustained by unjust social relations that shrink the agent\u2019s deliberative horizons; it would likely dissipate under conditions that respected her as an equal.  An autonomy-undermining preference, then, is one that is historically traceable to power-laden processes that block the agent\u2019s imaginative access to acceptable alternatives.  I develop this view in five steps.  \n\n1. I clarify what counts as an adaptive preference and why the fox-and-grapes trope captures only half the phenomenon.  \n2. I reconstruct and critique three leading autonomy accounts\u2014subjectivist, content-based, and historical\u2014showing why only the last can diagnose adaptive-preference deficits without lapsing into paternalism or moralism.  \n3. I introduce a new distinction between \u201cstrategic adaptation\u201d and \u201cstructural adaptation\u201d; the autonomy worry arises only for the latter.  \n4. I refine the historical view by adding an \u201cimaginative impoverishment\u201d condition, which reveals why some hard-won but freely chosen compromises (e.g. an Arctic researcher who comes to like seal meat) remain fully autonomous.  \n5. I defend the proposal against objections concerning cultural diversity, epistemic humility, and the risk of disempowering those we aim to help.\n\nI.  Adaptive preferences beyond the fox\n\nJon Elster borrowed Aesop\u2019s fox to explain how people modulate desires when options disappear.  But most real-world cases differ in two respects.  First, the constraints are not natural but social and unjust.  It is patriarchy, racism, or poverty\u2014not tall vines\u2014that makes the grapes unreachable.  Second, the agent\u2019s new preference is woven into her identity, not merely an ex post rationalization.  Consider Khadija, who grows up in a community where women\u2019s honor depends on early marriage.  She comes to want precisely that fate, resents friends who seek university education, and later pressures her own daughter to marry at sixteen.  Khadija\u2019s preference is \u201cadaptive\u201d because it emerged under restricted options, but it is also volitional and identity-constituting.  If we decide it is non-autonomous, we must explain where the deficit lies without denying that Khadija acts knowingly and reflectively.\n\nII.  Three explanatory strategies\n\nA.  Subjectivist endorsement models  \nHarry Frankfurt\u2019s hierarchical account locates autonomy in second-order endorsement: I act autonomously when I want to be moved by the first-order desire that actually moves me.  Khadija does display such endorsement; asked why she married early she says, \u201cBecause that is the life I most treasure.\u201d  A Frankfurtian must therefore declare her preference fully autonomous\u2014which seems to miss what oppression does.  Defenders reply that autonomy requires the capacity to form higher-order volitions free of coercion, and patriarchy may damage that capacity.  Yet Frankfurt\u2019s theory has few resources to detect *structural* coercion that never appears as overt pressure.  So longs as endorsement is sincere, the account blesses preferences that are products of social domination.\n\nB.  Content-based accounts  \nPerfectionists reverse the strategy: they evaluate autonomy by the objective worth of what is chosen.  If early marriage stunts human flourishing, preferring it is ipso facto non-autonomous.  This avoids Frankfurt\u2019s blindness to oppression, yet purchases critical power at an unacceptable price.  First, it collapses autonomy into well-being: every mistake about the good becomes an autonomy failure, eroding the distinct value of self-direction.  Second, it risks cultural imperialism.  Perhaps communal child-rearing or lifelong celibacy also diverge from liberal ideals of agency; are their adherents non-autonomous?  Finally, content tests misfire in benign adaptations: an astronaut who teaches herself to love dehydrated food shows no loss of autonomy even though dehydrated food is objectively bad cuisine.\n\nC.  Historical\u2013relational accounts  \nHistorical accounts\u2014rooted in work by Diana Meyers, Marina Oshana, and Natalie Stoljar\u2014locate autonomy in the *social processes* through which preferences are formed.  A preference is autonomous only if, roughly, it results from critical reflection under conditions free of manipulation, coercion, and oppressive norms that silence alternatives.  This view seems to mark exactly what bothers us: Khadija\u2019s preference traces to patriarchal norms that foreclose the imaginative space in which late marriage or singlehood could appear as live options.  If, in a counterfactual social world where women are equals, she would likely form different preferences, then her actual preference lacks full authority.  We thus move from synchronic endorsement or moral worth to diachronic, power-sensitive genealogy.\n\nIII.  Strategic vs. structural adaptation: sharpening the target\n\nEven an historical account needs refinement, for not all adaptation to constraint is autonomy-deficient.  Suppose Amir, a refugee crossing the Sahara, develops an intense preference for lukewarm, brackish water\u2014the only kind available.  After resettlement he continues to enjoy it, unaffected by abundant sweet water.  We hesitate to label this preference non-autonomous; it began as a strategy for survival and was adopted knowingly for that purpose.  Call this \u201cstrategic adaptation\u201d: the agent *knows* she is adjusting, could say \u201cI\u2019m making the best of a bad situation,\u201d and would likely revert if constraints vanished.\n\nContrast \u201cstructural adaptation,\u201d where background power relations invisibly prune an agent\u2019s preference formation so that she cannot conceive of alternatives as truly *hers*.  Khadija\u2019s early-marriage preference is structural: she does not experience it as a makeshift compromise but as the natural shape of a good life.  The historical account must therefore add that the agent\u2019s critical and imaginative capacities have been suppressed or directed by unjust structures.\n\nIV.  The imaginative-impoverishment thesis\n\nTo capture structural adaptation, I propose the following autonomy test:\n\nA preference P of agent A is less than fully autonomous if and only if  \n(i) P was formed and is sustained in social conditions that deny A equal moral respect (the injustice condition);  \n(ii) those conditions systematically limited A\u2019s *imaginative access* to feasible alternative values or life plans (the impoverishment condition); and  \n(iii) were the injustice lifted and alternatives rendered salient, there is a robust probability that A would not endorse P on reflection (the counterfactual independence condition).\n\nCondition (ii) does the key work.  It shifts focus from external coercion to internalized horizons of possibility.  Crucially, it also explains why some historically shaped preferences remain autonomous.  Amir\u2019s brackish-water taste meets (i) but fails (ii): he always *imagined* better water and could articulate why he settles for worse.  Hence his preference is strategic and autonomous.  By contrast, Khadija\u2019s social milieu erases the very intelligibility of late marriage, satisfying (ii) and revealing an autonomy loss.\n\nNotice how this proposal outperforms its rivals.  Unlike subjectivism, it analyzes endorsement in light of the agent\u2019s imaginative ecology, not merely its surface sincerity.  Unlike content views, it does not declare a preference defective because outsiders deem it unworthy; the moral test is located in the background relations of respect, not in the object desired.  And unlike bare historical views, it specifies the *mechanism*\u2014imaginative impoverishment\u2014that connects injustice to non-autonomy.\n\nV.  Objections and replies\n\n1.  Paternalism: \u201cWho are we to say Khadija could not imagine alternatives?  She might have examined them and rejected them.\u201d\n\nReply: The test requires evidence that alternatives were socially silenced or devalued, not merely that Khadija chose otherwise.  Empirical work on internalized oppression (e.g. stereotype threat, silencing of female sexuality) can reveal such patterns.  Moreover, the counterfactual condition preserves epistemic humility: we judge non-autonomy only where there is *robust probability* of preference reversal given equal respect, not in marginal or speculative cases.\n\n2.  Cultural imperialism: \u201cThe view privileges liberal individualism; perhaps Khadija values communal honor more highly than Western autonomy.\u201d\n\nReply: My account is explicitly relational, not individualistic; it measures autonomy by the degree of *equal respect* and *imaginative scope* available within a culture, not by conformity to Western life plans.  If Khadija had rich opportunities to explore competing conceptions of honor and still chose early marriage, her preference could be autonomous even if it diverges from liberal ideals.  What matters is the *process*, not the cultural content.\n\n3.  Ambitious counterfactuals: \u201cHow can we know what someone would prefer in a just world?\u201d\n\nReply:  We cannot know with certainty, but we often have reasonable evidence\u2014comparative studies of similarly situated people who gain access to education, narratives of exit from oppressive contexts, controlled experiments on preference change.  The historical\u2013relational view is therefore a fallible but workable heuristic, akin to legal tests for undue influence in contract law.\n\n4.  Disempowerment: \u201cLabeling oppressed agents as non-autonomous dismisses their agency and can justify unwelcome intervention.\u201d\n\nReply: Recognizing autonomy deficits should guide *structural* change, not override individuals\u2019 immediate choices.  The point is to expand people\u2019s option sets and imaginative horizons, not to coerce them into outsider-approved ends.  Policies such as conditional cash transfers for girls\u2019 schooling, public campaigns showcasing alternative female life courses, or legal reforms delaying marriage ages aim to create the very conditions under which agents can author preferences afresh.\n\nConclusion\n\nAdaptive preferences expose a fault line in our theories of autonomy.  Subjectivist accounts fetishize endorsement and overlook the silent work of oppression; content tests covertly collapse autonomy into objective value; simple historical views diagnose injustice but lack a mechanism.  A refined historical\u2013relational model, centered on imaginative impoverishment and tested by counterfactual independence, best explains why structural adaptation yields less-than-fully-autonomous preferences while leaving room for strategic, fully autonomous adaptations.  This framework both respects agents\u2019 present voices and recognizes how unjust social relations can colonize the imagination itself.  By targeting the social production of constrained horizons, we honor the core ideal of autonomy: not the empty freedom to affirm what one already prefers, but the substantive capacity to envisage and pursue a wider range of possible lives.", "output_tokens": 2861, "reasoning_tokens": 448}

Introduction: The puzzle of adaptive preference\n\nImagine a teenager in a rural village who announces that she does not want to finish secondary school because \u201cbooks are not for girls.\u201d Outsiders suspect something is askew: her avowed preference looks compatible with self-government\u2014she is not being frog-marched to the fields\u2014but it simultaneously looks like the signature of oppressive norms that have colonized her imagination. The general phenomenon is what Jon Elster called \u201cadaptive preference formation\u201d: when feasible options shrink, people often adjust their wants downward so that what remains available is what they come to want. Such preferences are neither merely irrational (they can be instrumentally coherent) nor straightforwardly coerced. Yet they seem \u201cless than fully autonomous.\u201d The philosophical task is to say why.\n\nI shall defend the following thesis.\n\nThesis: Adaptive preferences exhibit an autonomy deficit because they are the causal products of background power relations that systematically restrict an agent\u2019s opportunity set in ways the agent herself could not reject under minimally favorable counterfactual conditions. The deficit is best captured by a relational\u2013historical account that (a) diagnoses autonomy in terms of how a preference was formed and (b) evaluates that formation in light of counterfactual independence from oppressive constraints. Subjectivist endorsement theories and content-based moral filters each capture genuine insights, but by themselves they misclassify too many cases. A historically sensitive, relational procedure explains both why some adaptive preferences are heteronomous and why adaptation can sometimes be perfectly autonomous.\n\nRoad-map. Section 2 reconstructs the leading subjectivist, content-based, and historical models. Sections 3\u20135 test each model against three paradigm cases: Elster\u2019s \u201csweet grapes,\u201d the rural teenager, and the happily subservient domestic partner. Section 6 develops my relational\u2013historical proposal. Section 7 replies to objections. Section 8 concludes with implications for policy and moral psychology.\n\n2. Three families of accounts\n\n2.1 Subjectivist endorsement models  \nFrankfurt\u2019s hierarchical conception is paradigmatic. A desire D is autonomous if the agent endorses D at a higher-order level\u2014if she \u201cwholeheartedly identifies\u201d with it. Contemporary proceduralists (e.g., Christman) add refinements: endorsement must be the product of critical reflection and free from manipulation. Content is irrelevant; genesis matters only insofar as it blocks authentic reflection in the present.\n\n2.2 Content-based accounts  \nNussbaum and Sen judge autonomy by the substantive quality of a preference\u2019s object. Preferences for self-mutilation, servility, or deprivation manifest a failure to recognize one\u2019s own dignity or capabilities, and thereby betray reduced autonomy. What matters, therefore, is not endorsement but what is endorsed.\n\n2.3 Historical (process-genealogical) accounts  \nMeyers, Oshana, and Benson argue that autonomy depends on the causal history of a preference. Preferences that originate through socialization under oppressive norms lack autonomy even if the agent presently endorses them. Authentic self-governance requires that preferences emerge through a history in which the agent (i) had access to a range of options and (ii) participated in forming her motivational set without coercive distortion.\n\n3. Testing the accounts\n\n3.1 Case 1: The sour grapes peasant  \nA peasant, unable to afford wine, convinces himself that he never cared for it. Frankfurt-style endorsement need not disqualify the new preference: the peasant may sincerely endorse teetotaling. Likewise, wanting to abstain from wine is morally innocuous, so content-based filters yield autonomy. Yet something still seems fishy: the preference was shaped by scarcity, not by the peasant\u2019s evaluative standpoint. Historical diagnosis captures this: had cheap wine been available, he would likely have wanted it.\n\n3.2 Case 2: \u201cBooks are not for girls\u201d  \nThe teenager\u2019s second-order endorsement may be wholehearted; she may feel no ambivalence. Some content-based theorists flag the preference as autonomy-reducing because it frustrates the capability for education. Still, consider another girl who voluntarily chooses farming after genuine exploration of alternatives; content alone cannot mark the difference. What generates the deficit is the social history: patriarchal norms curtailed her sense of possibility before she could have entertained alternatives.\n\n3.3 Case 3: The cheerfully deferential spouse  \nPicture a partner who happily shoulders all domestic labor, explaining that \u201cserving my husband is my nature.\u201d This preference is morally suspect\u2014content theorists correctly balk\u2014but moral suspicion alone does not settle autonomy. Suppose the partner is a devout adherent of a religious community that she joined as an adult after critical reflection; here historical openness would count in favor of autonomy even though the content remains servile. Again, genesis, not content as such, seems decisive.\n\nInterim verdict: subjectivist endorsement fails because oppressive cultures can colonize higher-order reflection; pure content tests misfire both by over-inclusive condemnation (religious self-gift) and by under-inclusive license (sour grapes). Historical conditions track our intuitions more reliably.\n\n4. Diagnosing the strengths and weaknesses\n\n4.1 Limitations of subjectivism  \nThe crux is that endorsement is shaped by the very constraints under scrutiny. Hierarchical reflection is \u201cdownstream\u201d of socialization; therefore, it risks rubber-stamping the products of domination. Proceduralists try to add manipulation-filters, but oppression is rarely a single discrete manipulation; it is atmospheric and ubiquitous. Without a notion of \u201cbackground justice,\u201d endorsement tests float free of the social context that warps desire.\n\n4.2 Problems for content tests  \nContent criteria collapse autonomy into substantive well-being. That move conflates two questions: \u201cIs this good for the agent?\u201d and \u201cIs the agent self-governing?\u201d A life of self-chosen asceticism or risky mountaineering might be bad by perfectionist lights yet perfectly autonomous. Moreover, invoking a list of correct goods re-introduces paternalism: who decides the moral quality of an object of desire?\n\n4.3 Advantages and open questions for historical accounts  \nHistorical theories avoid both pitfalls: they respect subjective pluralism (an agent may autonomously choose domesticity) yet detect heteronomy when preferences trace to unchosen power imbalances. The open challenge is to specify which aspects of the causal history matter. A purely causal account threatens defeatism: every preference is shaped by some contingency. We need principled criteria distinguishing autonomy-preserving from autonomy-defeating histories.\n\n5. Toward a relational\u2013historical criterion\n\nI propose the following relational\u2013historical condition of autonomy for preferences P:\n\nRH: A preference P is autonomous for agent A in context C iff (i) P is stably endorsed by A after minimally self-accessible critical reflection, and (ii) the formation and stabilization of P are not such that, under a nearby counterfactual world where oppressive constraints on A\u2019s opportunity set are absent, A would repudi\u00adate P.\n\nClause (ii) introduces a \u201ccounterfactual independence\u201d requirement keyed to oppression. The test is relational because oppressive constraints are defined relative to power relations, not mere scarcity, and historical because it looks at the genealogy of P. Clause (i) retains the procedural demand that the agent understand and endorse her desire. Clause (ii) rules out endorsements forged in the crucible of unjust constraint.\n\nWhy counterfactual rather than actual availability? Because the problem with adaptive preferences is not that alternatives are literally impossible; it is that social power has removed them from the agent\u2019s deliberative horizon. Imagining a nearby world\u2014identical except for the oppressive constraint\u2014surfaces whether the preference expresses the agent\u2019s values or merely rationalizes deprivation.\n\n5.1 How RH clarifies the cases\n\n\u2022 Sour grapes: Remove scarcity; the peasant would drink wine. RH (ii) fails; the preference is heteronomous.\n\n\u2022 \u201cBooks are not for girls\u201d: In the counterfactual world without gender norms limiting education, the teenager newly imagines academic life and opts in. RH (ii) fails.\n\n\u2022 Cheerfully deferential spouse: Suppose in an oppression-free counterfactual she still chooses domestic devotion for religious or aesthetic reasons. RH (ii) succeeds; the preference is autonomous despite its servile content.\n\n5.2 Comparison with existing historical proposals  \nElster invokes \u201cpreference change that would not have occurred had the earlier options remained feasible.\u201d My criterion refines this by embedding the feasibility constraint within an account of oppression and requiring reflective endorsement. Benson\u2019s notion of \u201calienating socialization\u201d similarly stresses oppressive origins, but RH adds a modal structure that can be operationalized: empirical research can elicit whether people would reject a preference once new options emerge (e.g., through development interventions).\n\n6. Objections and replies\n\nObjection 1: Counterfactual tests are epistemically opaque. How could we know what someone would want in a different social world?  \nReply: The test is regulative, not predictive. We approximate counterfactual independence by (a) exposing agents to expanded information and options (deliberative polling, empowerment programs) and (b) studying preference shifts when oppressive barriers are lifted historically. Social scientists already use such methods.\n\nObjection 2: RH over-intellectualizes autonomy by demanding critical reflection. What about young children or cognitively disabled adults?  \nReply: Reflection need only be \u201cminimally self-accessible\u201d relative to the agent\u2019s capacities. For children, guardians approximate the counterfactual condition by anticipating future repudiation. The account therefore scales with competence without denying personhood.\n\nObjection 3: Some adaptive preferences seem benign\u2014preferring tea when coffee is unavailable. Does RH absurdly condemn these?  \nReply: Scarcity is not ipso facto oppressive. RH\u2019s relational component limits the test to constraints born of unjust power. Lack of coffee on a camping trip is a natural limit, not a dominative structure, so clause (ii) is not triggered.\n\nObjection 4: The proposal risks perfectionist drift; deciding what counts as oppression smuggles in moral judgments.  \nReply: Any autonomy analysis presupposes evaluative commitments (e.g., that manipulation is bad). The present account makes those commitments explicit: oppression is defined by systematic, unjust power hierarchies that inhibit equal standing. That notion is contestable, but contestability is the fate of political concepts; transparency is a virtue, not a vice.\n\n7. Policy and psychological implications\n\nThe relational\u2013historical model has practical bite.\n\n7.1 Development ethics  \nWhen aid agencies confront communities where women \u201cprefer\u201d FGM or early marriage, RH warns against two extremes: (a) na\u00efve respect for stated preferences and (b) paternalist override based on moral disgust. Instead, agencies should ask whether these preferences would survive once women accessed education, income, and alternative social scripts\u2014and should design interventions to test that hypothesis.\n\n7.2 Mental health  \nClinicians often face patients who \u201cprefer\u201d to remain in abusive relationships. RH provides a diagnostic lens: is the preference resilient when patients imagine safe environments and receive resources? Therapy can be framed as facilitating the counterfactual exploration required for autonomous choice.\n\n7.3 Labor and market design  \nEmployers sometimes defend low wages by citing workers\u2019 expressed contentment. RH reminds us that expressed satisfaction under monopsony power is not evidence of autonomous preference; improving bargaining conditions may alter what workers want, revealing earlier endorsements as adaptive.\n\n8. Conclusion\n\nAdaptive preferences puzzle us because they straddle the line between rational coping and self-betrayal. Subjectivist theories prize endorsement but overlook how reflection itself can be colonized; content-based theories protect well-being but risk moralism. Historical accounts, especially when refined by a relational, counterfactual condition, best illuminate the autonomy deficit at stake. Genuine autonomy is not mere reflective endorsement nor the pursuit of objectively valuable goods; it is the capacity to form and hold preferences that would withstand the lifting of unjust constraints. This insight honors both the first-person standpoint of agents and the moral urgency of dismantling oppression\u2014showing that respect for autonomy and critiques of injustice are not competing values but two sides of a single philosophical coin.", "output_tokens": 2904, "reasoning_tokens": 384}

Orientation and thesis  \n\nThe phenomenon of adaptive preference\u2014an agent\u2019s having come genuinely to want what is feasible for her given serious constraints\u2014seems to undermine the very idea that satisfying what someone wants is sufficient for respecting her autonomy.  Why does autonomy go missing here?  Three prominent families of answers compete:\n\n\u2022 Subjectivist or structural accounts, exemplified by Frankfurt, look inside the agent\u2019s psychic economy and ask whether she endorses her first\u2010order desires.  \n\u2022 Content\u2010based accounts, associated with Nussbaum and some perfectionists, assess the value of what is preferred.  \n\u2022 Historical accounts explain the deficit by appeal to the etiology of the preference: it was shaped by domination, threat, or deprivation in ways that bypass or deform the agent\u2019s powers of self\u2010governance.\n\nWhile each view captures an important intuition, I shall argue that the autonomy deficit characteristic of oppressive adaptive preferences is best explained by a refined historical view that I call the Distorted Formation Account.  On this account a preference is non-autonomous when (i) its formation involved social mechanisms that predictably disable the agent\u2019s capacity to imagine or evaluate unavailable options, and (ii) the preference would be destabilised by minimally improved opportunity and deliberative conditions.  The historical explanation carries the normative weight, but it must be supplemented by a counterfactual \u201cresilience\u201d test to distinguish rational, self-protective adaptation from domination-induced distortion.  The resulting hybrid traces autonomy failure to oppressive history without lapsing into perfectionist paternalism or implausible psychologism.\n\n2. Clarifying the target phenomenon  \n\n\u201cAutonomy\u201d names a second-order power: the capacity to govern one\u2019s practical life by reasons one can regard as one\u2019s own.  It therefore has both synchronic and diachronic dimensions.  Synchronic: does the agent presently identify with the motives that move her?  Diachronic: were those motives themselves generated by processes that preserved her critical and imaginative capacities across time?\n\nAn \u201cadaptive\u201d preference, following Elster and Sen, is one whose content adjusts to a restricted feasible set.  Not every such adjustment threatens autonomy.  A mountaineer who gives up an Everest attempt because a storm closes the window may cheerfully adapt her goal to a nearby peak without loss of self-rule.  What worries us are preferences shaped by standing, systematic constraints\u2014e.g. patriarchal norms that narrow women\u2019s aspirations, colonial institutions that limit the horizons of subject peoples, or permanent poverty that makes certain choices psychologically impossible to contemplate.  In these contexts agents may sincerely prefer options that entrench their subordination: the \u201chappy slave,\u201d the self-effacing wife, the trafficked child who begs not to be rescued.  The philosophical problem is to explain why these endorsed, wellbeing-promoting preferences are nevertheless less than fully autonomous.\n\n3. The subjectivist endorsement model  \n\nFrankfurtian autonomy demands wholeheartedness: an agent is autonomous with respect to a first-order desire if she endorses it upon reflective awareness.  The immediate attraction is that adaptive preferences often lack such endorsement.  Oppressed agents frequently experience ambivalence, self-contempt, or dissonance once they become reflectively aware of the social forces shaping them.  \n\nYet two systematic difficulties weaken the model\u2019s explanatory reach:\n\n(a) The abundance of wholehearted adaptive preferences.  Empirical work on internalised oppression documents cases in which agents are, at least for long stretches, serenely committed to their constrained ideals.  The woman in a village who trains her daughter to seek a good dowry marriage may feel no conflict.  By Frankfurt\u2019s lights the preference is autonomous, but our intuition says something has gone wrong.\n\n(b) Ignorance of social etiology.  Hierarchical reflection takes the agent\u2019s existing horizon of possibilities as given.  If that horizon is itself a product of domination\u2014if entire categories of aspiration are literally unimaginable\u2014the second-order endorsement certifies what needs critical scrutiny.  Wholeheartedness inside a hermeneutically sealed domain is too cheap.\n\nSubjectivism therefore misses the distinctive mark of oppressive adaptation: not inner conflict but a socially engineered narrowing of the space in which conflict could arise.\n\n4. Content\u2010based perfectionism  \n\nContent theorists bypass the psychology and locate autonomy deficits in the object of desire itself.  If what the agent prefers is inconsistent with basic human capabilities\u2014bodily integrity, practical reason, imaginative freedom\u2014then the preference is disqualified as autonomous.  Martha Nussbaum offers a vivid case: women in North Indian villages who reject literacy programs because they see schooling as useless for daughters.  Such preferences, she claims, are autonomy-deficient because they betray a core human capability for practical reason.\n\nThe perfectionist strategy does explain why we regard some adaptive preferences as problematic even when agents endorse them.  But it pays several costs:\n\n(a) Paternalism.  The authority to declare which contents are unworthy sits outside the agent\u2019s evaluative standpoint.  Critics worry that this slides from diagnosing autonomy failure into substituting the theorist\u2019s conception of the good.\n\n(b) Overbreadth.  People sometimes autonomously choose projects that foreclose capabilities\u2014monastic seclusion, high-risk adventure, or devotional obedience.  Content scrutiny alone cannot distinguish those free sacrifices from oppressive adaptation without reintroducing historical or structural considerations.\n\n(c) Blindness to rational coping.  Some adaptive preferences are autonomy\u2010preserving strategies for navigating unremovable constraints.  The starving man who trains himself to find edible grass appealing may protect his agency rather than lose it.  A purely content-based veto labels all such coping self\u2010betrayal.\n\n5. Etiology and the historical turn  \n\nHistorical accounts shift the focus from current mental states and from the value of outcomes to the social processes that produced the desire.  Benson\u2019s \u201cmanipulation\u201d criterion, Oshana\u2019s \u201csocial relations\u201d view, and Khader\u2019s \u201cprocess\u2010oriented\u201d analysis of adaptive preference all share the core thought: domination can so shape preference formation that the resultant wants are not authentically the agent\u2019s, even if they are now wholeheartedly held and pursuit of them yields local satisfaction.\n\nWhy does history matter?  Because autonomy is a capacity that itself develops historically.  Forming, revising, and ranking motives over time requires opportunities for imaginative exploration, exposure to alternatives, dialogical challenge, and freedom from sanction for deviance.  Oppressive socialisation predictably degrades these enabling conditions.  Preferences forged under such degradation carry an \u201cetiological taint\u201d: they were not formed by the agent\u2019s evaluative powers operating under normal competence conditions.\n\nThe historical perspective successfully explains why wholeheartedness is not enough and why the problem is especially acute under oppression.  It also avoids judging preferences by their content alone: a preference to be a full\u2010time homemaker can be autonomously chosen in an egalitarian community but non-autonomous when produced by patriarchal conditioning.\n\nNevertheless, extant historical accounts face two tasks:\n\n(i) Differentiation: they must separate oppressive distortion from rational self-protection within constraints.  \n(ii) Action\u2010guidance: they must tell policymakers when intervention is justified without insulting competent agents who disagree with the proposed alternative.\n\n6. The Distorted Formation Account  \n\nTo answer these tasks I propose a two-part criterion for autonomy with respect to a preference P:\n\n(1) Etiological Independence Condition: P must not be the predictable outcome of social mechanisms (threat, deprivation, hermeneutic marginalisation) whose function is to limit the agent\u2019s imaginative or deliberative range so as to secure her compliance with subordinating norms.  \n\n(2) Counterfactual Resilience Condition: If the agent were placed, over a reasonable period, in circumstances where those mechanisms are absent and where a modestly expanded set of live options is practically available and normatively affirmed, she would either revise or doubt P with appreciable probability.\n\nIf a preference fails both conditions, it is autonomy-deficient.  Condition (1) assigns the historical explanatory work; condition (2) filters out the Everest mountaineer and the starving grass-eater, whose preferences would likely survive opportunity expansion; their formation was adaptive in a rational, coping sense rather than a domination-induced sense.\n\n7. Illustrative cases  \n\na. The case of Shanti, the dowry mother.  Shanti lives in a region where daughters traditionally join their husband\u2019s household.  Schooling girls lowers their marriage prospects and strains family finances.  Shanti sincerely prefers early marriage for her daughter and rejects NGO scholarship offers.  \n\nEtiological independence fails: her preference is the outcome of a social system that penalises deviation through economic sanction and honour codes.  Counterfactual resilience also fails: in nearby districts where the dowry system has collapsed and female schooling is valorised, women previously like Shanti overwhelmingly shift preferences.  Result: autonomy deficit.\n\nb. The Everest mountaineer.  Storm closes summit window; climber adapts goal to a nearby peak.  Social mechanisms of domination absent; preference would survive in counterfactual fair conditions.  Autonomy intact.\n\nc. The starving grass-eater.  Deprivation not inflicted by an agent aiming at domination; once food scarcity ends, the preference for grass might persist as harmless culinary quirk.  Etiological independence arguably satisfied, or at least domination absent; resilience satisfied.  No autonomy deficit.\n\nd. The cloistered novice.  She voluntarily adopts a life of obedience after years of exposure to secular opportunities and dialogue.  Formation not predictably engineered by social powers aimed at subordination (the convent screens for authentic vocation).  Preference passes both tests.  Autonomy preserved despite self-subordination content.\n\n8. Objections and replies  \n\nObjection 1: The counterfactual test is speculative and paternalistic; outsiders will project their own values onto imagined futures.\n\nReply:  The test is anchored not in the evaluator\u2019s ideals but in empirical data about how similarly situated agents behave when constraints ease.  It is defeasible and requires humility: if evidence shows resilience, intervention should cease.  Moreover, oppressed agents themselves often articulate counterfactual aspirations once safe contexts permit, vindicating the test\u2019s sensitivity to first-person authority.\n\nObjection 2: Some oppressive contexts yield Stockholm-syndrome loyalty so deep that even opportunity expansion leaves preferences intact.  The account would misclassify these as autonomous.\n\nReply:  Condition (1) already diagnoses autonomy deficit due to etiology.  Resilience is a supplementary filter; both conditions must be met for autonomy.  Therefore even pathologically stable oppressive preferences remain non-autonomous.\n\nObjection 3: The view collapses into content perfectionism because \u201cdomination\u201d mechanisms are identified partly by their unjust content.\n\nReply:  Domination is defined structurally: systematic power asymmetries that curtail critical capacities, regardless of whether the resulting content offends specific perfectionist goods.  A culture could inculcate Spartan self-abnegation (a value Nussbaum might applaud) through coercive indoctrination; if so, autonomy fails, even though the content tracks capabilities.  The Distorted Formation Account therefore remains content-neutral.\n\n9. Advantages over rivals  \n\nCompared with subjectivism, the historical account explains why wholehearted preference can still be alien.  It also guides social policy: expand capabilities and interpretive horizons, rather than merely nudge inner reflection.\n\nCompared with content perfectionism, it respects pluralism about life plans and avoids the need for an external ranking of goods.  It condemns the preference for female cutting in patriarchal societies not because genital alteration is intrinsically irrational, but because the desire is produced by silencing, threat, and misinformation.\n\nCompared with generic historical views, the Distorted Formation Account adds a principled distinction between oppressive distortion and rational adaptation, using the counterfactual resilience test grounded in comparative social evidence.  It thereby wards off the overbreadth worry that labels all coping strategies unfree.\n\n10. Policy and ethical implications  \n\nUnderstanding autonomy deficit etiologically has at least three practical payoffs:\n\n1. Interventions should target the social mechanisms, not override the preference directly.  Provide schooling subsidies, anti-harassment enforcement, and public exemplars rather than forcibly enrolling girls.  \n2. Measurement of success must be diachronic.  The goal is not immediate preference change but restoring the agent\u2019s capability to revisit preferences over time.  \n3. Respect for agency demands listening.  Agents may endorse temporary compromises\u2014e.g. conditional participation in programs\u2014that reflect their local knowledge of risk.  Eliminating domination is compatible with honoring such strategies.\n\n11. Residual puzzles and research directions  \n\nTwo hard questions remain.  First, can large-scale structural mechanisms\u2014capitalist advertising, digital echo chambers\u2014generate autonomy deficits even absent direct oppression?  Exploring where manipulation shades into ordinary social influence will refine the Etiological Independence Condition.\n\nSecond, how long and how expansive must the counterfactual period and opportunity set be?  Neuroscientific work on preference plasticity and sociological studies of aspiration windows may offer empirically tractable parameters.  Philosophically, the issue connects to debates about diachronic identity: what proportion of the same person must remain to count preference revision as her own rather than her successor\u2019s?\n\n12. Conclusion  \n\nAdaptive preferences under oppression are not just unfortunate compromises; they are symptoms of a breakdown in the historical conditions that normally allow persons to become the authors of their own desires.  Subjectivist endorsement accounts miss this because they freeze the frame on the present psyche; content accounts miss it because they moralise the outcome rather than the process.  A historically rooted analysis, refined by a counterfactual resilience test, best captures our judgments and guides respectful, autonomy-restoring social change.  Autonomy is less a moment of internal assent than an ongoing, socially sustained practice of looking beyond what has been made thinkable.  Only by attending to the history of how horizons get narrowed\u2014and by reopening them\u2014can we secure the self-government that oppressed agents are owed.", "output_tokens": 3435, "reasoning_tokens": 512}

Framing the Puzzle  \n\nMany people come to desire exactly what oppressive social structures make easily available.  \n\u2022 The long-term prisoner develops a taste for \u201cyard time\u201d over mountain hikes.  \n\u2022 The factory child in Dhaka regards education as a nuisance and a sewing machine as a blessing.  \n\u2022 The undocumented house-cleaner in Berlin interprets her apathy toward voting as proof that \u201cpolitics isn\u2019t for people like me.\u201d  \n\nThese are paradigmatic adaptive preferences: attitudes that take shape in response to severe constraints on the agent\u2019s feasible set. The intuitive worry is not merely that such preferences are unfortunate; it is that they are, in a sense, *less than fully the agent\u2019s own.* They exhibit an autonomy deficit even when\u2014indeed, precisely when\u2014the person sincerely endorses them. What, exactly, explains that deficit?  \n\nThree families of answers dominate the literature.  \nA. Subjectivist (procedural) views, epitomized by Frankfurt, locate autonomy in higher-order endorsement or reflective identification.  \nB. Content-based views identify substantive moral flaws in the preferred ends; oppression damages autonomy by steering desire toward the wrong objects.  \nC. Historical views identify defects in *how* the attitudes were formed, independently of current endorsement or content.  \n\nMy thesis is three-part:  \n1. Purely subjectivist accounts *fail* because any endorsement powerful enough to silence adaptive critiques automatically counts the preference as autonomous.  \n2. Purely content-based accounts misdiagnose many perfectly autonomous but morally troubling desires (think of an affluent sadist) and cannot explain why some adapted preferences (like valuing a simple meal in wartime) strike us as *fully* one\u2019s own.  \n3. Historical accounts come closest, but they need to be supplemented with a *relational* requirement: autonomy also depends on the agent\u2019s standing in a network of social recognition that makes intelligible a meaningful alternative horizon.  \n\nAn adaptive preference is autonomy-defective when (i) it is produced by a history of constrained accommodation to illegitimate social power and (ii) the same social power continues to block the agent from *recognizing* the historical contingency of that preference within a community of equals. The deficit is thus both diachronic (a tainted causal pathway) and synchronic (ongoing relational deprivation). A hybrid \u201cprocess-relational\u201d theory explains why adaptive preferences under oppression feel alienated without collapsing into paternalism or moralism.\n\n2. Clarifying \u201cAdaptive Preference\u201d  \n\nThe term, borrowed from rational-choice theory (via Jon Elster) and social justice debates (Sen, Nussbaum), covers three features:\n\na. Constraint-responsiveness: The desire arises *because* significant options are unavailable or risky.  \nb. Counterfactual instability: Were the constraints lifted in the right way, the agent would likely revise the preference.  \nc. Internalization: The preference is not merely strategic behavior; it is felt as a genuine disposition or source of satisfaction.  \n\nBecause (b) need not hold for all cases\u2014sometimes people stick to old tastes even after liberation\u2014I will treat (a) and (c) as definitional and treat (b) as typical but defeasible.  \n\n3. Procedural / Subjectivist Accounts: Frankfurt, Dworkin, et al.  \n\nOn Frankfurt\u2019s celebrated hierarchy, a desire is autonomous if the agent *wants to want* it (second-order volition) and that higher-order attitude is itself unopposed. Adaptive preferences appear susceptible to this diagnostic: if the oppressed housewife endorses her \u201cdomestic calling,\u201d surely that is her will?\n\nCritique:  \ni. Endorsement can be manufactured. Training, indoctrination, and normative deprivation can align second-order volitions with constraints rather than with the agent\u2019s independent interests. Frankfurt\u2019s own proviso of \u201cfreedom of the will\u201d does little work when formative conditions systematically shape what higher-order attitudes are even imaginable.  \n\nii. The view lacks *diachronic sensitivity*: once endorsement is present *now*, the historical route disappears from evaluative purview. But temporally asymmetric data is central to the adaptive-preference phenomenon.  \n\niii. By valorizing structure over context, subjectivism rules out critique from the inside. It licenses calling the contented slave \u201cfully autonomous\u201d if she internalizes servitude. Yet the moral phenomenology of outrage many of us feel is aimed exactly at the way in which *her* endorsement seems purchased at the price of options stolen.  \n\nIn short, hierarchical endorsement is\u2014by design\u2014too procedurally thin to register autonomy deficits rooted in unjust socialization.\n\n4. Content-Based Accounts: Capabilities, Perfectionism, Substantive Morality  \n\nMartha Nussbaum argues that preferences incompatible with a threshold of basic capabilities (bodily integrity, practical reason, etc.) are non-autonomous. The housewife who refuses education fails the *practical reason* capability; hence her choice lacks autonomous standing.\n\nMerits:  \n\u2022 Incorporates the intuitive link between oppression and disvalue.  \n\u2022 Provides a normative reason to *intervene* even with voluntary choices.  \n\nProblems:  \ni. Conflation of well-being and autonomy. A sadistic aristocrat violates no capability but is hardly a poster child of freedom. Conversely, an ascetic monk may autonomously reject capabilities he deems worldly.  \n\nii. Paternalism. Declaring preferences non-autonomous when they clash with an objective list risks disrespectful overreach, especially in cross-cultural contexts. The suspicion that adaptive preferences are defective derives not (or not only) from their content but from their genesis under domination.  \n\niii. Context Insensitivity. Eating only rice for religious reasons in affluent Boston could be a free commitment; eating only rice because colonial policy destroyed your other crops is adaptive. Content alone cannot discriminate.\n\nThus, while content matters morally, it tracks a different dimension from autonomy. Substantive lists blur that boundary.\n\n5. Historical Accounts: Socialization, Coercion, and the \u201cRight Kind\u201d of Causal Path  \n\nHistorical or \u201ccausal\u201d theories (e.g., Christman, Oshana, Benson) propose that an attitude is autonomous only if it has not been produced by manipulative, coercive, or oppressive forces *in a way that bypasses the agent\u2019s critical capacities.*  \n\nStrengths:  \n\u2022 Captures our sense that *how* a preference came about matters.  \n\u2022 Avoids moralizing the content; a desire can be odious yet autonomous if its genealogy is clean.  \n\u2022 Makes sense of \u201cliberation narratives,\u201d where learning about one\u2019s history precipitates alienation from old desires.\n\nChallenges:  \na. Demarcation: Which causal influences are disqualifying? Socialization always shapes us; only some yield autonomy-deficits.  \n\nb. Present-moment silence: A preference forged under injustice but now reflectively re-endorsed might pass the historical test unless we specify that ongoing structural injustice *matters now.*  \n\nc. Epistemic Access: Agents rarely know the full causal story of their desires; must such knowledge be required?  \n\nDespite these issues, historical models furnish the most plausible backbone; they need further articulation rather than replacement.\n\n6. Toward a Process-Relational Account  \n\nMy proposal hybridizes the causal insight with a *relational* criterion inspired by Iris Marion Young and relational autonomy theorists.  \n\nDefinition (PR-Autonomy):  \nA preference P of agent A at time t is *fully autonomous* iff  \n\n(i) Process Condition: P was not substantially shaped by coercive or illegitimate social power that bypassed A\u2019s capacity for critical reflection, *or* if it was, A has since engaged those very critical capacities under conditions approximating equality with others, *and*  \n\n(ii) Relational Recognition Condition: At t, A stands in social relations that (a) affirm her epistemic standing to question P, (b) supply bona-fide alternative scripts, and (c) refrain from sanctions for dissent.  \n\nWhen either clause fails, an autonomy deficit obtains. Adaptive preferences formed in oppressive environments typically violate (i) and, because the oppressive structures endure, still violate (ii). The two conditions jointly explain why past contamination alone doesn\u2019t doom a preference (people can critically reclaim values) and why present relational deprivation alone can suffocate autonomy even if the historical record is clean.\n\n7. Illustrative Cases  \n\nCase 1: Rani, the Rural Child Bride  \nRani, married at 13, insists at 20 that early marriage is ideal: \u201cGirls who wait become burdens.\u201d Her desire grew amid patriarchal coercion (violating Process) and she still lives in a village where dissenting women are shamed (violating Recognition). PR-Autonomy classifies her preference as non-autonomous.\n\nContrast with: Nasreen, also married early but now studying in Delhi among peers who value delayed marriage. After courses in gender history, she still tells a friend, \u201cMarrying young gave me emotional advantages.\u201d Process contamination remains, but clause (i)\u2019s second disjunct plus (ii) might redeem her preference as autonomous, though critics may still question its prudence.\n\nCase 2: Althea, the Wartime Survivor  \nDuring siege, Althea taught herself to relish thin gruel because nothing else was available. Years later, in peace and prosperity, she still prefers it. The preference was certainly adaptive, but there is no standing injustice sustaining it now; she is free, recognized, and critical. PR-Autonomy judges the taste fully her own. Content-based views might awkwardly object (\u201cgruel is bad for you\u201d), while procedural subjectivism and the hybrid view agree on autonomy.\n\n8. Objections and Replies  \n\nObjection 1: The view collapses into an opportunity account\u2014if the agent has genuine options, she is autonomous; if not, she isn\u2019t. That\u2019s old news.  \nReply: Options alone are insufficient. A wealthy cult member may exit freely but faces epistemic isolation that satisfies neither clause (i) (manipulative formation) nor (ii) (recognition deficit). Conversely, a peasant with few material options might nonetheless autonomously endorse agrarian simplicity if the process was non-coercive and her community honors dissent. The theory is sensitive to power relations, not raw option count.\n\nObjection 2: Too demanding epistemically; many ordinary preferences fail the recognition condition.  \nReply: Full autonomy is indeed demanding, but practical applications (e.g., policy interventions) can employ a threshold concept: the more severe the violation, the stronger the permission to interfere or compensate. Everyday low-stakes adaptivity (preferring local cuisine due to availability) only mildly fails the condition and thus hardly justifies paternalism.\n\nObjection 3: Relational recognition smuggles in a liberal view of society. Authoritarians will reject it, so the account is question-begging.  \nReply: The autonomy debate itself presupposes the value of self-government; any theory of autonomy that eschews this presupposition ceases to be about autonomy. The relational condition simply explicates what \u201cself-government\u201d entails: not solitary introspection, but membership in discursive relations of mutual respect.\n\n9. Advantages of the Hybrid  \n\n\u2022 Explains why *both* origin story and current oppression matter.  \n\u2022 Avoids labeling every adaptive preference defective: some are harmless quirks or authentic revisions stabilized after reflective reclamation.  \n\u2022 Respects agent authority: the key to redemption is the agent\u2019s own critical uptake, aided by social recognition, not external content evaluators.  \n\u2022 Guides reform: to remediate autonomy deficits, one must both open the option set and build social venues for respectful contestation. This dual strategy clarifies why micro-credit alone or consciousness-raising alone underperform; they each tackle only one clause.\n\n10. Relationship to Existing Theories  \n\nChristman\u2019s \u201cprocedurally independent\u201d requirement captures Process (i) but neglects the relational ecology that sustains critical reflection.  \nOshana\u2019s social-relations view approximates clause (ii) but underplays diachronic causality, leading her to regard affluent but isolated agents as unfree regardless of their histories, a possible overreach.  \nNussbaum\u2019s capabilities provide a moral baseline but can be repurposed: capabilities can anchor the *illegitimacy* test in clause (i)\u2014a process is contaminating when it systematically thwarts capability development. Thus the hybrid theory coordinates, rather than chooses among, insights from rival accounts.\n\n11. Policy and Ethical Implications  \n\nWhen NGOs confront child-marriage preferences or labor suppression, the hybrid theory advises:  \n(a) Diagnosis: Distinguish lack-of-resources adaptivity from internalized inferiority by examining both formation history and present recognition networks.  \n(b) Remedy: Pair option-expansion (education, legal rights) with *narrative platforms*\u2014radio dramas, women\u2019s councils, peer discussion\u2014so that beneficiaries can articulate and contest inherited desires.  \n(c) Respectful Paternalism: Interventions are justified not because the content is wrong per se but because the autonomy conditions are structurally unachievable without help. Temporal limits on intervention follow: once recognition conditions obtain, coercive paternalism loses its warrant.\n\n12. Conclusion  \n\nAdaptive preferences trace a deep fault-line in theories of autonomy. Procedural endorsement models are too internal, content models too moralistic, pure causal models not relational enough. A process-relational account, blending historical scrutiny with current recognitional standing, best captures why\u2014and when\u2014adapted desires under oppression fail to be fully our own.  \n\nIt also restores hope. For the prisoner who learns to love the yard, or the child bride who learns to demand more, liberation is not forced from outside but catalyzed when social conditions enable her to *see* her wanting as historically conditioned and still open to revision. Autonomy, on this view, is not a static property of isolated minds but an achievement of persons in just relations over time.", "output_tokens": 3489, "reasoning_tokens": 512}

Setting the Problem  \nIn the mid-1970s Amartya Sen interviewed famine-stricken widows in rural Bengal. Asked whether they suffered, many answered, \u201cNot really; I have grown used to it.\u201d A decade later, Martha Nussbaum met women in Rajasthan who declared they did not \u201cneed\u201d literacy and that eating last, after the men, was \u201conly natural.\u201d Such cases have become canonical in debates about adaptive preference formation. They provoke a double reaction: on the one hand, what the women say looks like a genuine expression of their own agency; on the other, we are reluctant to treat their acceptance of deprivation as fully autonomous. What exactly is missing?\n\nA preference is \u201cadaptive\u201d when it is shaped to fit a restricted choice set\u2014often one structured by poverty or oppression. The puzzle is to articulate why these preferences are autonomy-defective without disrespecting the agents themselves. Does the problem lie in the way the agents *endorse* these desires (subjectivist accounts), in the *content* of what they prefer (objective-list or perfectionist accounts), or in the *history* of how the preference came about?\n\nThesis  \nThe autonomy deficit characteristic of adaptive preferences is best explained by a *historical-relational* account: a preference is non-autonomous to the extent that it originates in social processes that deny the agent equal standing and foreclose imaginative access to alternatives. Subjectivist \u201cendorsement\u201d and purely content-based yardsticks mislocate the deficit. Autonomy\u2019s enemy is not just hierarchical misalignment nor objectionable content but a deformation in the *social etiology* of desire. I defend this view in four steps:  \n\n1. Clarify what we should demand of an autonomy-grounding preference.  \n2. Show why Frankfurt-style hierarchies cannot diagnose adaptive deficits.  \n3. Argue that content-based tests collapse autonomy into morality and overreach.  \n4. Develop a historically sensitive criterion that withstands key objections and explains the intuitive data.  \n\n2. Autonomy and the Architecture of Preference  \nCall a preference P *fully autonomous* when the agent could continue to endorse P across contexts in which (i) she is adequately informed, (ii) she enjoys social conditions of equal respect, and (iii) she can vividly envisage live alternatives. These conditions are counterfactual\u2014they need not obtain empirically\u2014but they function as a normative filter. What adaptive preferences typically lack is (iii): structural constraints shrink the imaginative horizon, so the preference is born in motivational penury. Note that this is a historical diagnosis: the preference\u2019s genealogy traverses unjust pathways.\n\n3. The Subjectivist (Hierarchy-of-Desire) Account  \nOn Harry Frankfurt\u2019s influential model, a desire is autonomous if the agent *wholeheartedly* endorses it at a higher order. If the Rajasthan woman reflectively affirms that she *wants* to eat last, Frankfurt must count her preference fully her own. The problem is twofold.\n\n3.1 The Plasticity Objection  \nEndorsement is itself malleable. Socialization can shape not only first-order desires (to eat last) but also second-order volitions (wanting to want to eat last). A hierarchy of desires, no matter how many levels deep, can be colonized by background power structures. The hierarchy model therefore cannot distinguish between endorsement that expresses genuine self-authorship and endorsement that is the result of adaptive internalization.\n\n3.2 The Factivity Gap  \nEven if wholeheartedness signals subjective satisfaction, autonomy also has an *intersubjective* dimension: it matters whether others had the standing to coerce, manipulate, or marginalize the agent during preference formation. Frankfurt\u2019s model, laser-focused on inner endorsement, brackets that dimension and so misses why oppression, rather than mere causal influence, is autonomy-undermining.\n\nAttempts to patch Frankfurt with \u201cprocedural\u201d enhancements\u2014requiring e.g. that reflection be free of coercion\u2014still fall short because subtle social pressures are neither episodic nor explicit. They function as background *structural injustices* that shape what the agent can even imagine as worthy. Subjectivism, in short, is too internal and too synchronic.\n\n4. The Content-Based Account  \nSome philosophers, often those sympathetic to perfectionist or objective-list theories of welfare, locate the deficit in *what* the agents prefer. A preference for illiteracy supposedly fails an objective test: literacy is just *good* for humans. If the agent wants the bad, something must be amiss in her agency.\n\n4.1 Autonomy versus Morality  \nBut autonomy is a procedural notion; it concerns who authors a desire, not whether the desire\u2019s object is good. People may autonomously choose dangerous mountain climbs or morally dubious careers. Conversely, an oppressed person might adaptively prefer a *good* such as modest schooling (better than nothing) while renouncing higher education. The content test thus misclassifies many cases.\n\n4.2 Paternalism and Epistemic Hubris  \nContent-tests empower third parties to override stated preferences whenever they conflict with the evaluator\u2019s value set. That rings paternalistic, especially across cultural divides. Moreover, content does not explain *why* adaptive preferences cluster around the local constraints; it merely marks them as bad.\n\n4.3 The \u201cBad Content, Intact Autonomy\u201d Data  \nImagine a sexist professor who autonomously prefers to hire men despite knowing it is unjust; or a thrill-seeker who wants self-harm. These agents are blameworthy but still acting from their own lights. So bad content cannot be sufficient for autonomy failure. The real deficit in adaptive cases must lie elsewhere.\n\n5. Historical-Relational Accounts  \nHistorical accounts shift focus from endorsement and content to genealogy. A preference is autonomous only if it arises through a history that leaves the agent *answerable* to herself under conditions of equal respect. The locus classicus is Diana Meyers\u2019s \u201cautonomous self\u201d and Marina Oshana\u2019s *relational autonomy*. The idea has two components:\n\n\u2022 Etiology: The causal path by which the preference formed must be free of domination, manipulation, or deprivation that cripples imaginative agency.  \n\u2022 Relational Meaning: The social meaning attached to holding that preference must not signify the agent\u2019s lesser status.\n\n5.1 Explaining the Canonical Cases  \nReturning to Sen\u2019s widows: their history involves entrenched gender norms, widow shaming, and food scarcity. The preference \u201cI don\u2019t need more\u201d can be traced to systematic deprivation that narrowed their horizons. On the relational-historical view, this genealogy suffices to mark their preference non-autonomous even though the widows may sincerely endorse it and even though \u201ceating more\u201d is morally permissible content.\n\n5.2 Avoiding Paternalism  \nUnlike the content view, the historical test does not treat external evaluators\u2019 substantive values as decisive. It asks: did the agent herself have a credible opportunity to *discover* and *appraise* alternatives? If yes, her preference stands, however odd. If not, the preference is pro tanto suspect. This retains respect for diversity while critiquing injustice.\n\n5.3 Granularity and Comparative Judgments  \nThe historical account can register degrees of autonomy. A preference shaped in moderate cultural pressure may be somewhat adaptive but still largely self-authored; one born of violent coercion marks a deeper deficit. Subjectivist and content-based models are cruder.\n\n6. A Diagnosis: Imaginative Erosion  \nI propose refining the historical view with the notion of *imaginative erosion*. An agent suffers imaginative erosion when structural constraints make salient options literally *unthinkable* or *unrepresentable* as live possibilities. The erosion can be:\n\na) Informational (lack of exposure),  \nb) Evaluative (norms that stigmatize alternative aspirations),  \nc) Affective (emotional penalties such as shame for deviating).\n\nAdaptive preferences are those that crystallize within such eroded imaginative landscapes. This diagnosis explains why they feel less than fully autonomous: the preference formation process bypasses the agent\u2019s capacity to evaluate *real* options. Autonomy, after all, is self-rule in the space of reasons, not merely within the cage of given options.\n\n7. The Counterfactual Respect Test  \nTo operationalize the idea, consider: *Would the agent, under conditions of social respect and access to information, foreseeably endorse a substantively wider set of options?* If yes, her present preference is marked by a deficit. Crucially, we need not know the exact alternative she would choose; only that the unjust history foreclosed viable deliberation. This counters the standard objection that historical accounts require impossible knowledge of hypothetical selves.\n\n8. Objections and Replies  \nObjection 1: \u201cAll preferences have histories; drawing the line is arbitrary.\u201d  \nReply: True, influence is ubiquitous. The relevant distinction is between influence that merely *persuades* and influence that *arbitrarily privileges* certain options by denying the agent equal standing. The criterion is *social justice*, not causal purity.\n\nObjection 2: \u201cYour view infantilizes oppressed agents by second-guessing their choices.\u201d  \nReply: The historical test does not invalidate choices but diagnoses the injustice that shaped them. Recognizing how power deforms preference is a step toward expanding agency, not overriding it. Moreover, the counterfactual respect test is *agent-relative*: it asks what the very same person might want if accorded equal status, not what outsiders think she should want.\n\nObjection 3: \u201cHow do we measure \u2018imaginative access\u2019 without speculation?\u201d  \nReply: We can examine empirical markers: literacy rates, media exposure, mobility, reported awareness of alternatives, and qualitative interviews. While imperfect, these are no more speculative than assessments of competence in medical consent or of coercion in contract law.\n\n9. Comparative Payoff  \nSubjectivist models get wrong-way results in paradigm cases: wholehearted adaptive preferences pass, but we think them autonomy-defective. Content models mistake autonomy for morality and generate both false positives (autonomous but immoral) and negatives (morally good but non-autonomous). Historical-relational analysis neither collapses the concepts nor ignores power. It predicts precisely the cases that trouble us and does so without paternalistic overreach.\n\n10. Epilogue: Autonomy as a Social Achievement  \nAdaptive preferences teach a larger lesson: autonomy is not a predicate we ascribe to isolated moments of choice but a *temporally extended* and *socially scaffolded* achievement. To secure it, societies must cultivate material resources, dismantle oppressive norms, and widen imaginative horizons. When minds adapt to cages, the failure is not in endorsement or content but in the history that built the cage and erased its bars from view.\n\nWord count: ~2,060", "output_tokens": 2748, "reasoning_tokens": 448}

Introduction: the riddle of cheerful deprivation  \n\nA woman in a drought-prone village reports that she \u201cnever really wanted\u201d to attend school. Asked why, she explains that walking four hours each day to collect water for her family \u201cmakes her feel useful,\u201d whereas schooling is \u201ca luxury for city girls.\u201d Her preference is neither coerced in the familiar sense (no one is holding a gun to her head) nor obviously irrational (fetching water is indeed necessary). Yet many of us hesitate to treat her preference as fully her own, because it was formed in response to the very background deprivation we find objectionable. Such cases are paradigms of *adaptive preference formation*: people come to prefer what is feasible, or even to love the chains that bind them.  \n\nThe question is how best to diagnose the resulting *autonomy deficit*. Three families of accounts compete:\n\n\u2022 Subjectivist or procedural theories, exemplified by Frankfurt, locate autonomy in internal endorsement of first-order desires by \u201chigher-order\u201d desires.  \n\u2022 Content-based theories judge autonomy by the substantive worth of what is preferred: autonomy is undermined when one wants things that are bad, degrading, or contrary to human flourishing.  \n\u2022 Historical (or relational-etiological) theories tie autonomy to the causal pathway by which the preference was formed: a preference is autonomous only if it is not the product of certain distorting forces such as indoctrination or oppressive socialization.\n\nMy thesis is threefold. (i) Purely subjectivist accounts fail because oppressive environments can shape second-order volitions as easily as first-order ones; they mistake internal coherence for self-authorship. (ii) Purely content-based accounts succeed in tracking many autonomy deficits but do so for the wrong reason; they risk collapsing autonomy into well-being and cannot explain why some harmful preferences (e.g., demanding military training) *do* seem autonomous. (iii) A refined historical account, informed by a *counterfactual resilience* test\u2014would the agent retain the preference under suitably expanded options?\u2014best captures what adaptive preferences lack. Such an account respects plurality of values while illuminating the specific way oppression compromises self-direction.\n\nTo defend this thesis I proceed as follows. Section 2 disentangles adaptive preferences from mere prudential adjustment. Section 3 critiques hierarchical endorsement theories. Section 4 assesses substantive-goodness views. Section 5 develops my historical-resilience proposal and shows how it handles difficult cases. Section 6 replies to objections concerning paternalism, causal over-determination, and the ubiquity of social influence. Section 7 concludes by sketching implications for policy and for the ethics of respect.\n\n2. What exactly is an adaptive preference?  \n\nNot every preference shaped by feasibility constraints is suspect; after all, learning to like lentils when meat is scarce can be a rational, autonomy-preserving adjustment. We need a sharper characterization. Let us call a preference *cheerfully depriving* when (a) it arises in response to a background deprivation or domination, and (b) it sustains or rationalizes that very condition. Unequal circumstances are not merely accommodated; they are embraced. It is in such \u201ccheerful deprivation\u201d cases\u2014think of slaves who \u201clove their chains,\u201d or women who \u201cnaturally\u201d prefer subservient domestic roles\u2014that the autonomy worry bites.  \n\nBecause the phenomenon is relational (it presupposes a social structure that constrains options) and diachronic (formation over time), any adequate theory of autonomy must incorporate those dimensions.\n\n3. The limits of hierarchical endorsement  \n\nHarry Frankfurt\u2019s celebrated model holds that autonomy (or, strictly, *freedom of the will*) consists in having higher-order volitions that identify with one\u2019s first-order desires. An agent is unfree when she *acts* on a desire she does not *want* to be effective (e.g., the unwilling addict). At first glance, this seems promising: adaptive preferences might lack second-order endorsement. Yet the happy villager does not merely fetch water; she explicitly *endorses* that preference\u2014\u201cI never wanted school.\u201d Frankfurt\u2019s account therefore counts the preference as autonomous.\n\nCould Frankfurtians salvage the view by adding richer procedural conditions\u2014say, requirements of *reflective equilibrium* or *informed deliberation*? Unfortunately, oppressive contexts can colonize those very procedures. Studies in social psychology and feminist epistemology show that sustained exposure to limited opportunities sculpts not only first-order desires but also the criteria by which agents evaluate those desires. A girl who has never seen women run businesses may find her reflective equilibrium satisfied by a domestic ideal. The problem is not that she fails to reflect; it is that the raw materials of reflection are themselves filtered.  \n\nThus, hierarchical endorsement is structurally blind to *endogenous preference formation*: it treats the internal hierarchy as sui generis rather than as the downstream product of social power. In short, the model confuses *coherent self-organization* with *self-creation*.\n\n4. Content-based shortcuts and their costs  \n\nMartha Nussbaum and other \u201cobjective goods\u201d theorists maintain that some life activities\u2014political participation, bodily health, play\u2014are constitutive of human flourishing. When someone prefers options inconsistent with those capabilities, the preference is non-autonomous. This neatly explains our intuition about the cheerful water-carrier: her preference undercuts the capability for education.  \n\nYet the very neatness is suspicious. First, the account is *over-inclusive*: a soldier who autonomously chooses a perilous mission sacrifices health but is hardly less self-governing. Second, it is *under-diagnostic*: it does not tell us whether the autonomy deficit stems from the content of the preference per se or from how that preference came about. If the water-carrier inherited vast wealth tomorrow and still disliked school, we might continue to find her preference odd but no longer autonomy-deficient. Content alone cannot pick out that difference.  \n\nThird, equating autonomy with objective flourishing blurs two distinct moral ideas: *self-direction* and *well-being*. Disagreement about the good life is endemic; a liberal theory of autonomy should not adjudicate it ex ante. Otherwise, autonomy becomes the hostage of perfectionism.\n\n5. A historical-relational account with a counterfactual twist  \n\nThe historical family of theories begins with an appealing thought: what matters is whether the preference bears the right kind of causal relation to the agent\u2019s exercise of capacities for reflection and choice. Inituitively, a desire hypnotically implanted is not mine, however passionately I feel it. But which causal histories disqualify?  \n\nProposals range from \u201cnon-coercive upbringing\u201d (Mele) to \u201cabsence of illegitimate social pressures\u201d (Oshana). These are either too narrow (they neglect subtle forms of domination) or too vague (which social pressures are illegitimate?). I propose the following refinement.\n\nH1. Etiological Independence Condition  \nA preference P is non-autonomous for agent A if P would be unlikely to arise, and unlikely to persist, under a counterfactually expanded set of feasible options in which the oppressive constraint C is removed and A has minimally adequate information and deliberative time.\n\nH2. Social Situatedness Clause  \nThe relevant counterfactual holding-fixed set includes A\u2019s enduring values, relationships, and cultural commitments *except* those straightforwardly traceable to C.\n\nThe idea of *counterfactual resilience* captures why the preference to fetch water is suspect: absent the deprivation (if potable water were accessible and schooling feasible) the woman herself would probably not endorse it. By contrast, a devout monk\u2019s preference for asceticism may well survive an expansion of options; therefore it is plausibly autonomous even though it diminishes certain capabilities.  \n\nNotice three virtues of this test.  \n\na) It is procedural rather than substantive; it focuses on how the preference would fare under better conditions, not on whether the object of desire is objectively good.  \n\nb) It need not deny the causal ubiquity of social influence\u2014after all, *every* preference has a history\u2014but only disqualifies those histories that are *opprimenda causa sui*, preferences that owe their existence to a harm they help normalize.  \n\nc) It aligns with political intuitions about justice: removing oppressive structures is the morally appropriate response, rather than simply disregarding the agent\u2019s professed wishes.\n\n6. Hard cases and comparative advantages  \n\nConsider three scenarios:\n\nCase 1: Foot-binding in Qing-era China. Millions of women professed pride in bound feet, taking them as marks of beauty and status. When the practice was outlawed and social pressures lifted, the preference swiftly collapsed. Historical-resilience labels it non-autonomous; hierarchical endorsement cannot; content-based views can but only at the cost of ranking beauty goals as non-autonomous tout court.\n\nCase 2: The secular ascetic. A philosophy graduate, after reading Epictetus, freely chooses a life of frugality, rejecting consumerism. Clamped behind his choice is a history of Western capitalism and personal experiences of disgust at consumer excess\u2014structural influences, to be sure. Yet under expanded options (say, a universal basic income) his preference remains steadfast. Historical-resilience judges it autonomous even though it restricts material well-being; content-based approaches might uneasily concur, but only by conceding that capability losses can be autonomously chosen.\n\nCase 3: The \u201cPink-collar pragmatist.\u201d Raised in a patriarchal society, a woman happily pursues secretarial work, finding comfort in the nurturing office culture. She admits that if opportunities were equal she \u201cmight have tried law,\u201d but insists she is currently content. Counterfactual resilience flags a deficit: the preference would likely shift under egalitarian conditions. Yet the diagnosis is proportional: her autonomy is compromised *as to occupational aspirations*, not across the board.\n\nThese comparisons indicate that the historical-resilience model tracks our intuitions more finely and avoids the false positives and negatives endemic to the alternatives.\n\n7. Objections and replies  \n\nObjection 1: \u201cPaternalism redux.\u201d If the state or NGO judges a preference non-autonomous by your counterfactual test, may it override the agent\u2019s expressed wishes? Reply: The test merely diagnoses autonomy; justificatory work remains for a theory of *legitimate interference*. One plausible principle is the *least restrictive empowerment* rule: one may offer expanded options and information but must ultimately defer to the agent\u2019s second-order judgement within the new landscape. On this view, building local wells and offering scholarships is permissible; forcing the woman to attend school is not.\n\nObjection 2: \u201cInfinite regress of influences.\u201d Every preference traces back to some constraint; why privilege some constraints (oppressive) over others (e.g., scarcity of tropical fruit in Scandinavia)? Reply: The Social Situatedness Clause isolates constraints that are (i) the product of human injustice, not natural circumstance; and (ii) sustain asymmetric power relations. Scarcity of mangoes is unfortunate but not a domination structure. Admittedly borderline cases remain, but the distinction is workable and morally salient.\n\nObjection 3: \u201cStability under expanded options could be due to adaptive preference *inertia*.\u201d The woman might keep preferring domesticity simply because habit is sticky. Does historical-resilience misclassify such stubborn preferences as autonomous? Two replies. (a) Stickiness itself can be oppressive residue; we must examine whether habit persistence counts as dependence on C. (b) Autonomy is scalar. A sticky but revisable preference may exhibit partial autonomy; policies can respect it while facilitating revisability (e.g., adult education programs).\n\n8. Relationship to feminist and psycho-social literature  \n\nThe counterfactual-resilience account resonates with Serene Khader\u2019s proposal that adaptive preferences are those one would not have formed \u201cabsent deprivation,\u201d but it goes further by specifying the modal test and adding the persistence condition. It also integrates insights from social psychology on *learned helplessness* and from analytic metaphysics on counterfactual causation (Lewis, Woodward). By treating autonomy as *robust* to the removal of dominating causes, we borrow the virtue epistemology idea of *safety* and *sensitivity* and apply it to practical preference.\n\n9. Normative payoff: respect without romanticization  \n\nOne normative anxiety surrounding adaptive preferences is the tension between respecting agents\u2019 declared values and refusing to ratify oppressive structures. The historical-resilience test allows us to say both: \u201cWe acknowledge your current preference; nevertheless we have reason to suspect that its grip over you depends on circumstances we are committed to changing.\u201d That dual stance grounds policies of *option-expansion* rather than *option-substitution*.\n\n10. Conclusion  \n\nAdaptive preferences expose a fault line in autonomy theory: the need to explain how background power shapes not only what we choose but *what we want to choose*. Subjectivist endorsement theories mislocate the problem inside the agent\u2019s reflective hierarchy, whereas content-based theories externalize it to objective lists of goods. Both miss the specific *etiological dependency* that adaptive preferences manifest.\n\nA historical-relational account, sharpened by a counterfactual resilience condition, explains why preferences cultivated by oppression are not fully ours: they are motivational scaffolds that would crumble were the oppression lifted. This explanation respects cultural pluralism, avoids collapsing autonomy into well-being, and provides nuanced guidance for social intervention.\n\nIf autonomy is ultimately about being the ongoing author of one\u2019s life, the authorial voice must remain audible when the background noise of domination is dialed down. Where the voice fades with the noise, we have located an autonomy deficit\u2014one that theory must name and justice must rectify.", "output_tokens": 3267, "reasoning_tokens": 384}

Setting the Puzzle  \nThe literature on *adaptive preferences* begins with an everyday observation: when our option set shrinks, what we want often shifts to fit the new menu. The fox, unable to reach the grapes, decides they were probably sour anyway; a child growing up in a desert comes genuinely to prefer water to winter sports; a woman in a patriarchal village comes to value early marriage and obedience. In each case what is preferred is not grudgingly accepted as second\u2010best; it is wholeheartedly endorsed. Yet these endorsements strike many philosophers, activists, and policy-makers as *less than fully autonomous*. Why?\n\nAutonomy talk here is not merely diagnostic; it does moral work. If the preferences really *are* autonomous, paternalistic interventions that ignore them are presumptively disrespectful. If they are not, refusal to take them at face value may be warranted. Getting the autonomy story right therefore matters for everything from development ethics to medical consent.  \n\nThe philosophical challenge is to explain the deficit without sliding into either (i) a rigid internalism that counts any endorsed desire as autonomous simply because it is endorsed, or (ii) an external perfectionism that declares certain lives sub-optimal regardless of what the agent thinks. Three broad families of views dominate the debate.\n\n\u2022 Subjectivist or *procedural* accounts (e.g. Harry Frankfurt, Gerald Dworkin) locate autonomy in the agent\u2019s higher-order endorsement of her first-order desires.  \n\u2022 Content-based or *substantive* accounts (e.g. Martha Nussbaum, some perfectionist liberals) hold that autonomy requires wanting the right kinds of things.  \n\u2022 Historical or *process* accounts (e.g. Diana Meyers, Marina Oshana, John Christman) focus on *how* the preference was produced\u2014particularly whether it arose through non-manipulative pathways that preserve the agent\u2019s critical capacities.\n\nMy thesis is that none of these families by itself explains what is troubling about adaptive preferences under oppression. The best explanation is *relational-historical*: autonomy is undermined when a preference is the product of unjust social power that (i) forecloses viable alternatives and (ii) distorts the agent\u2019s deliberative field in ways she would reject under conditions of equal respect. A hierarchical model that looks only at psychological endorsement misses the structural constraint; a content model that looks only at what is preferred risks moralism; a purely historical model that neglects the *relational wrong* loses the normative anchor needed to say why some causal histories but not others spoil autonomy. By integrating the historical focus on processes with a relational focus on power, we can diagnose the autonomy deficit, respect agency, and avoid paternalism.\n\nThe remainder of the paper defends that claim in six steps.\n\n2. Why Procedural Endorsement Is Too Thin  \nFrankfurt\u2019s influential view makes autonomy a matter of inner architecture: a desire is fully one\u2019s own when endorsed by a volitional second order. Adaptive preferences often *pass* this test. The woman who prefers early marriage may sincerely approve of her preference; the ex-convict who \u201cloves\u201d the routine of prison may identify with that love.  \n\nTwo moves have been made to save the procedural picture.\n\n2.1. Higher-Order Defection  \nPerhaps the oppressed agent *would* reject the preference on further reflection. But Frankfurt already allows for an endless regression: as long as endorsement stabilises at some level, the desire is autonomous. A Shaker who reflectively embraces celibacy to honour God counts as autonomous even if outsiders find the preference bizarre. The challenge is that many adaptive preferences remain stable despite extensive introspection.\n\n2.2. Coercion and Manipulation Clauses  \nGerald Dworkin amends the view: autonomy requires that the process of preference formation be free from coercion, persuasion, or manipulation. However, adaptive preferences rarely arise from *explicit* coercion; they grow slowly through cultural socialisation, economic necessity, structural violence. These background forces do not fit the paradigm of a manipulator with the wrong intentions, so the Dworkinian clause fails to trigger.\n\nThe deeper problem is conceptual. Procedural internalism treats the agent as a self-contained chooser encased in a neutral environment. Oppression, by contrast, operates *through* the agent\u2019s motivational system\u2014by shaping what seems feasible, valuable, even thinkable. The fox\u2019s sour-grape strategy is procedurally impeccable; what it lacks is *fit* with a wider sphere of unforced possibility. The notion of a merely \u201cinternal\u201d endorsement is therefore too narrow to register the harm.\n\n3. Why Substantive Content Is Too Blunt  \nSubstantive theorists circumvent the prior difficulty by imposing content constraints: to be autonomous, one must prefer goods on an \u201cobjective list\u201d (Nussbaum), or ends that realise one\u2019s capacities for rational and emotional development (Raz). Since adaptive preferences often aim low\u2014sometimes disastrously low\u2014they will automatically flunk.  \n\nThe gains in explanatory power are immediate. We can say the oppressed woman\u2019s compliance is heteronomous because it frustrates capability for practical reason and affiliation. But the costs are serious.\n\n3.1. Value Pluralism  \nPeople autonomously pursue ends\u2014eccentric, ascetic, or merely ordinary\u2014that fall outside any plausible master list. A monk\u2019s vow of silence; an athlete\u2019s obsession with ultramarathons; a coder\u2019s single\u2010minded drive to optimise an esoteric algorithm. None fits the perfectionist template, yet each can be the product of robust self-authorship.\n\n3.2. Paternalistic Drift  \nIf evaluators decide ex ante what counts as a worthy life, they risk substituting their own ideals for the agent\u2019s. A development economist who dismisses a nomad\u2019s preference for pastoral life as \u201cadaptive\u201d because GDP per capita stays low enacts the very arrogance autonomy theory was meant to resist.\n\n3.3. The Wrong Kind of Explanation  \nFinally, content restrictions explain too *much*. They condemn any preference for an \u201cunworthy\u201d object, even where that preference was formed under utterly benign conditions. A consensual BDSM practitioner\u2019s desire for pain is neither oppressive nor adaptive to constraint; yet under strict content tests it might be ruled non-autonomous.\n\nWe still need an account that is sensitive to power without collapsing into perfectionism.\n\n4. Historical Accounts: A Step Forward but Not Far Enough  \nHistorical or process theorists relocate autonomy in the *etiology* of preference. John Christman proposes that a desire is autonomous if it results from a history free of controlling social influences the agent could not, on reflection, accept. Marina Oshana emphasises *social relationships*, arguing that autonomous agents must actually enjoy the external conditions for self-government, not merely imagine them.\n\nThese views improve on both procedural and content theories because they (i) recognise time and (ii) look outward towards social context. Yet standard historical accounts underdescribe how *systemic* oppression works. Consider the following:\n\nExample 1: Early Marriage in Rural Rajasthan  \nGirls growing up in certain districts of Rajasthan face credible threats\u2014ostracism, violence, economic destitution\u2014if they delay marriage. Over time many come to *value* early marriage as a source of security and familial honour. Crucially, this is not a one-time manipulation; it is a web of social meaning produced by caste norms, dowry laws, and local labour markets her family does not control.\n\nHistorical accounts require us to ask: was the preference formed through an alienating influence she would reject on reflection? But reflection itself is already colonised. If one has never seen a woman flourish outside early marriage, the counterfactual in which one \u201ccould\u201d reject the norm is cognitively unavailable. Christman acknowledges this danger, yet his proposal remains *individualistic*: it assigns autonomy status case by case based on whether the agent can in principle distance herself from the cause. Oppression\u2019s genius is that it shrinks the imaginative field so distancing *never even occurs*.\n\nWe therefore need to build an *explicit relational dimension*\u2014one that ties autonomy to background power gradients and the agent\u2019s standing among others.\n\n5. A Relational-Historical Account  \nHere is the core proposal, stated in the form of a *Relational Counterfactual Test*:\n\nPreference P of agent S is substantively autonomous *iff*   \n(1) P withstands S\u2019s sustained critical reflection *and*  \n(2) P would continue to withstand such reflection in a realistically improved social world W in which:  \n    (a) S enjoys secure access to a meaningful array of options not shaped by unjust power relations that systematically exclude or stigmatise, and  \n    (b) S\u2019s deliberation is not distorted by social norms that deny her equal moral status.\n\nClause (1) preserves the procedural insight: what matters partly is endorsement. Clause (2) incorporates history and structure: we ask whether the causal pathway to P relies on unjust power such that, once those forces are lifted, the preference would likely dissolve.\n\nSeveral features merit attention.\n\n5.1. Power, Not Content, Does the Normative Work  \nWe do not condemn P because it is \u201cobjectively bad\u201d but because its *dependence* on unjust power robs it of authority. This both respects pluralism and avoids perfectionism.\n\n5.2. The Counterfactual Is Social, Not Ideal  \nWorld W is not a utopia; it is a nearby social arrangement where relevant unjust constraints are removed. For early marriage in Rajasthan, W might include local schools admitting girls, anti-dowry enforcement, and effective policing of gendered violence. We need not imagine limitless resources or wholly transformed traditions\u2014only the absence of the specific oppressions that plausibly caused adaptive uptake.\n\n5.3. Empirical Content and Fallibility  \nBecause the test is counterfactual and empirical, it is fallible. We must study, often ethnographically, whether similar agents exposed to world W retain P. Sometimes they do. When Bangladeshi garment workers gain independent income, many still endorse purdah norms; when inner-city youth escape poverty, some still prefer hip hop culture over Harvard. Where P survives the test, respect for autonomy requires us to take it at face value.\n\n6. Case Studies Revisited  \n\n6.1. The Stoic Prisoner  \nConsider Primo Levi\u2019s account of the prisoner who \u201cloves\u201d the camp routine. Suppose he endorses that love at every higher order. Clause (2) asks whether he would still embrace the routine if the unintended injustice (the camp) disappeared. The obvious answer is no. The preference is thus heteronomous without appealing to value perfectionism; the fault lies in its tethering to genocidal power.\n\n6.2. The Desert Child  \nA child raised where snow is mythical prefers water games to skiing. World W removes no oppression, only the geographical barrier. The preference likely persists; it is autonomous. Adaptive change caused by *benign* constraints (climate, local ecology) does not undermine autonomy\u2014an intuitively plausible result.\n\n6.3. Voluntary Ascetic  \nA Buddhist monk who renounces sexual activity in a monastery that respects his equal moral status meets both clauses, since W without monastic vows is already available and he remains committed. The view therefore avoids pathologising self-chosen austerity.\n\n7. Objections and Replies  \n\nObjection 1: Epistemic Inaccessibility  \n\u201cHow can we know what the agent would prefer in world W?\u201d  \nReply: We cannot *know* with certainty, but social science can provide defeasible evidence: natural experiments, historical analogues, narrative testimony. Policymakers already rely on such evidence in public health and development; autonomy assessment need be no more perfect than risk assessment.\n\nObjection 2: Paternalism Redux  \n\u201cEvaluators still decide whether a constraint is \u2018unjust\u2019 and thus disqualifying.\u201d  \nReply: All autonomy tests embed normative judgments. The relational view at least makes the judgment explicit and contestable. Moreover, it sidelines perfectionist claims about the good life; only constraints that *deny equal moral status* or exclude options on that basis trigger the autonomy warning.\n\nObjection 3: The Romanticised Oppressed  \n\u201cSome agents valorise their oppressed identity\u2014consider the Appalachian miner proud of hard labour.\u201d  \nReply: Pride per se may be autonomous. The test targets preferences whose *existence* depends on the unjust limitation, not mere attachment to a stigmatised identity. If the miner had alternative dignified livelihoods and still cherished the mine, the preference would pass.\n\n8. Policy and Moral Implications  \nOne virtue of the relational-historical account is its practical guidance. It advises *expanding options first, then listening*. Development interventions should remove oppressive barriers (education, legal reform, health access) and see what people choose. If early marriage rates drop, we know those marriages were not fully autonomous; if they remain stable, respecting them becomes morally required. The approach also informs medical consent: a patient\u2019s refusal of treatment due to misinformation propagated by racist folklore implicates unjust power and may justify paternalistic correction; refusal based on informed religious faith does not.\n\n9. Philosophical Payoffs  \nThe proposal yields four theoretical dividends.\n\n(i) It reconciles freedom with realism: agents remain authors of their lives, but authorship can be corrupted by background injustice that operates through, not around, their mental states.  \n(ii) It re\u2010locates autonomy within a *relational* egalitarian framework: what matters is whether each person stands as a moral equal, able to shape her good without subordination.  \n(iii) It sharpens the distinction between *adaptive* and *adaptive\u2010but\u2010benign* preferences\u2014answering Elisabeth Anderson\u2019s call for a non-paternalistic metric.  \n(iv) It offers a bridge between analytic and continental insights: by marrying procedural endorsement to critical theory\u2019s emphasis on power, it shows how \u201cideology\u201d can undermine self-rule without denying subjective attachment.\n\n10. Conclusion  \nAdaptive preferences pose a genuine challenge because they reveal autonomy to be a *social achievement*, not a purely psychological state. Subjectivist models see only a willing agent; perfectionist models see only deficient content; historical models see only causal pathways. A relational-historical account synthesises their insights while avoiding their pitfalls. Autonomy, on this view, is preserved when endorsement coexists with equal standing and lost when endorsement is the artefact of oppression. The fox\u2019s grapes would still taste sweet in a world where the vine hung low; the oppressed woman\u2019s deference would evaporate where her opportunities flowered; the monk\u2019s vows would abide. Respecting persons therefore means both *transforming* the background to expose adaptive deformation and *listening* to what preferences endure once justice lets voices speak for themselves.", "output_tokens": 3739, "reasoning_tokens": 640}

A development worker worries that the woman\u2019s preference is \u201cadaptive\u201d: given grinding poverty, the near-certainty of social ostracism for the unmarried, and a lifetime of messages about women\u2019s proper role, her desire appears to have been shaped by oppressive constraints rather than by open reflection over an ample menu of options. But what exactly is missing? In what sense, if any, is her preference less than fully autonomous?\n\n\u2003\u2003Philosophers have offered three principal diagnoses.\n\n1. Subjectivist or procedural accounts (Frankfurt, Dworkin): a preference is autonomous if the agent endorses it upon higher-order reflection, regardless of its content or origin.\n\n2. Content-based accounts (Raz, some feminist perfectionists): a preference is autonomous only if it is for suitably valuable, or at least non-degrading, goods; oppressive preferences fail because the content is morally tainted.\n\n3. Historical or etiological accounts (Mackenzie, Oshana, Superson, Christman): a preference is autonomous only if it was formed through a history that is free of certain kinds of domination, manipulation, or deprivation.\n\n\u2003\u2003My thesis is three-part:\n\nA. Purely subjectivist models cannot diagnose the autonomy deficit of adaptive preferences, because endorsement itself can be adaptive; the higher-order desires of oppressed agents are often no less shaped by the constraints than their first-order ones.\n\nB. Purely content-based models correctly note that some preferences express internalized oppression, but they misidentify the root of the deficit, confusing moral evaluation with autonomy evaluation and inviting an objectionable paternalism.\n\nC. A refined historical account\u2014one that focuses on distorted \u201cdiachronic opportunities for self-construction\u201d rather than on any specific snapshot of endorsement or content\u2014captures the phenomenon most accurately. The relevant deficit lies in the agent\u2019s restricted history of option-encounter and norm-negotiation, not merely in what she currently prefers or in whether she presently endorses it.\n\n\u2003\u2003I defend (C) by showing how it can explain three puzzling features of adaptive preferences: their stability, their sincere endorsement, and their link to social power. I then integrate the most compelling insights of the other two families\u2014Frankfurtian self-reflection and Razian concern for self-respect\u2014into a unified historical-relational model. Finally, I reply to three objections: that historical accounts collapse into content-based ones, that they over-intellectualize autonomy, and that the developmental ideal they invoke is culturally imperialist.\n\nI. Why the Subjectivist Picture Breaks Down\n\n\u2003\u2003Consider Harry Frankfurt\u2019s influential idea: what matters is whether the agent identifies with her first-order preference. If the woman truly wants early marriage and also wants to want it, then her desire is autonomous; if she has a volitional conflict\u2014e.g., she wishes she could want a university education\u2014then the preference is not fully hers.\n\n\u2003\u2003Yet adaptive preferences are precisely puzzling because they are often accompanied by wholehearted, even enthusiastic, endorsement. Jon Elster\u2019s famous example of the fox who concludes the grapes are sour does not presuppose ambivalence. The fox\u2019s second-order desire aligns with the first-order one: he now wants not to want the grapes. The same alignment can hold for oppressed humans, generated by mechanisms such as cognitive dissonance reduction, socialization, and hedonic adaptation. Under severe constraint, endorsing the available\u2014no matter how meagre\u2014serves psychological survival.\n\n\u2003\u2003Subjectivists might respond that what matters is not mere endorsement but \u201cauthentic\u201d endorsement formed under conditions of adequate information and reflective equilibrium. However, two problems emerge:\n\n1. Circularity. To know whether reflection was \u201cadequate,\u201d we already need an independent standard for what counts as distorting; but identifying the relevant distortions is exactly the problem at stake.\n\n2. Insensitivity to power. The model treats the agent in isolation, ignoring that her reflective capacities themselves have been formed within coercive relationships. If her entire interpretive horizon has been narrowed, demanding that she merely endorse at a higher level will not detect the distortion.\n\n\u2003\u2003In short, subjectivism fails because it is present-tense and intrapsychic: it scans the agent\u2019s mind right now but cannot tell whether the mind has been molded under oppression.\n\nII. The Temptation and Trouble of Content-Based Tests\n\n\u2003\u2003A second reaction is to look at what the woman prefers. Preferring servitude, foot-binding, or self-immolation (sati) seems autonomy-denying on its face. Joseph Raz suggests that autonomy requires an \u201cadequate range of worthwhile options\u201d; if all the woman\u2019s options are degraded, she cannot be choosing autonomously.\n\n\u2003\u2003While intuitively powerful, this strategy conflates two questions:\n\n(a) Is the content morally defective?\n\n(b) Is the preference non-autonomous?\n\n\u2003\u2003Answers can diverge. An ascetic monk who freely renounces material goods chooses a life many regard as impoverished; yet if the life results from spiritual reflection and alternative exposure, we hesitate to call it heteronomous. Conversely, a terminally ill patient choosing dignified euthanasia might be making a highly autonomous choice even though the content involves self-annihilation.\n\n\u2003\u2003Content tests face three deeper worries.\n\n1. Paternalism. Declaring certain choices non-autonomous because we disapprove of them risks imposing external values. Oppression is not necessary for content to look morally suspect; we must isolate the role of oppression.\n\n2. Cultural myopia. Evaluators inevitably import their own normative frameworks, risking misclassification of culturally unfamiliar but autonomous preferences.\n\n3. False positives. Some oppressive systems harness apparently liberal values\u2014for example, \u201cchoice feminism\u201d marketing cosmetic surgery as empowerment. A content test might mistakenly rule such preferences autonomous because they pursue widely approved goods like beauty or success.\n\n\u2003\u2003Therefore, while content matters (I return to it later), it cannot be the primary criterion for autonomy.\n\nIII. Historical Diagnosis: Distorted Opportunity Sets\n\n\u2003\u2003Historical accounts locate the deficit in the process by which the preference was formed. Christopher B. \u201cChris\u201d Mackenzie stresses that agents need \u201cepisodic\u201d self-governance across time; Marina Oshana argues that autonomy demands a social environment that recognizes and supports the agent\u2019s authority. In adaptive contexts, the agent\u2019s history is marred by systematic deprivation: she has never been able to experiment with alternative life plans, never been given permission to evaluate prevailing norms, never encountered role models living differently. These facts, not merely her current mental state, vitiate her authorship.\n\n\u2003\u2003I propose the following refined historical criterion:\n\nA preference P is autonomous for agent A at time t only if\n\n1. Counterfactual Encounter: In nearby possible histories where A had minimally decent opportunities to encounter and trial a diversity of valuable options, there exists at least one such history in which A, after critical reflection, still endorses P.\n\n2. Diachronic Competence: A\u2019s capacities for critical reflection, information acquisition, and imaginative projection developed in an environment free from systematic coercion specifically aimed at molding P.\n\n3. Social Non-Domination: A reasonably expects that revising or abandoning P would not trigger severe sanctions (violence, shunning, starvation) from dominant groups.\n\n\u2003\u2003These three jointly explain why adaptive preferences lack autonomy.\n\nA. The Counterfactual Encounter clause captures the intuition that what matters is not whether the agent currently endorses the preference but whether she would endorse it after access to real alternatives.\n\nB. Diachronic Competence ensures we track manipulation: even if alternatives were nominally available, indoctrination can hobble the agent\u2019s deliberative powers.\n\nC. Social Non-Domination embeds freedom from coercion across time, recognizing that preferences may be \u201cchosen\u201d only because rejecting them is terrifyingly costly.\n\n\u2003\u2003Under patriarchal constraint, our rural woman fails (1) because she has never seen models of successful unmarried women; fails (2) because her schooling systematically undermined critical thought about gender; and fails (3) because remaining unmarried invites ostracism bordering on violence.\n\n\u2003\u2003Notice the historical account explains why adaptive preferences can be stable (the mechanism operates over childhood socialization), why they can be sincerely endorsed (no conflict shows up in present-tense reflection), and why they track power gradients (the distortion arises from domination).\n\nIV. Synthesizing Procedural and Content Insights\n\n\u2003\u2003One might worry that the historical model is silent about present-tense self-reflection and about the moral quality of options. I now show how both fit naturally within the historical framework.\n\n1. Procedural incorporation: Diachronic competence demands that the agent\u2019s present capacities for procedural reflection be the product of a non-dominating upbringing. If they are, then contemporary endorsement regains its relevance; if not, endorsement is suspect. Thus the historical model explains why subjectivist criteria sometimes work\u2014in non-oppressive contexts\u2014but not in adaptive ones.\n\n2. Content incorporation: Counterfactual encounter requires access to a \u201cdiversity of valuable options.\u201d This imports Raz\u2019s insight that autonomy needs worthwhile alternatives, yet avoids paternalism by focusing on modal availability rather than actual choice. We need not outlaw her preferred life; we must merely ensure she could have rejected it without penalty. Content enters only as a threshold for what counts as a genuinely distinct alternative, not as a veto on the agent\u2019s eventual choice.\n\nV. Examples That Do Work\n\n\u2003\u2003A. The Good Ascetic. A monk in a pluralistic society visits universities, holds a job, then freely enters monastic life. He passes all three historical tests; his preference for poverty is autonomous.\n\n\u2003\u2003B. The Cosmetic Surgery Enthusiast. A woman in a capitalist culture wants surgery to conform to beauty ideals. She has seen feminist critiques, has financially secure exit options, and would not face violence for refusing. She may still be influenced by patriarchal norms, but if she satisfies (1)-(3), her preference counts as autonomous even if feminists deplore the content. The disagreement is moral, not about authorship.\n\n\u2003\u2003C. Child Bride in Rural Region. Her preference fails all three tests; it is non-autonomous. Our account justifies state or NGO intervention aimed at expanding her opportunity set, not by declaring her mistaken about her good, but by rectifying the autonomy deficit in her preference formation.\n\n\u2003\u2003These examples illustrate how the historical model discerns between oppressive and non-oppressive contexts without moralizing content.\n\nVI. Replies to Objections\n\n1. Collapse into Content?\n\n\u2003\u2003Critics charge that using \u201cvaluable alternatives\u201d in clause (1) smuggles in substantive values. I reply that autonomy inevitably has a weak value-dependence: choosing from options all of which destroy cognition or bodily integrity cannot realize self-authorship because they prevent further authorship. The standard is minimalist and procedural: alternatives must permit sustained agency, not conform to any comprehensive doctrine.\n\n2. Too Intellectualist?\n\n\u2003\u2003Requiring counterfactual endorsement might seem to demand impossible cognitive feats. But the criterion is not a decision procedure for agents; it is an evaluative tool for observers (including the agent later in life) assessing autonomy. Much as we say a contract signed under duress is invalid even if the signatory did not grasp legal niceties, we can judge a preference non-autonomous based on historical facts, not on psychological sophistication.\n\n3. Cultural Imperialism?\n\n\u2003\u2003The model requires access to a diversity of options, but diversity is specified relative to the agent\u2019s own evaluative horizon once minimally decent education is supplied. Nothing in the account dictates specific Western lifestyles; it mandates only that oppressive structures not pre-empt the agent\u2019s process of horizon-formation. Indeed, the model can underwrite protection of indigenous ways of life if agents come to affirm them after open exploration, resisting missionary or corporate coercion.\n\nVII. Practical Payoff: Policy Without Paternalism\n\n\u2003\u2003Viewing autonomy deficits historically re-shapes intervention debates.\n\n1. Expand Option Windows: Education, travel scholarships, and safe houses enlarge the set of encountered alternatives, satisfying clause (1) without denigrating existing practices.\n\n2. Support Diachronic Competence: Critical pedagogy and media pluralism cultivate capacities for evaluation, meeting clause (2).\n\n3. Dismantle Coercive Sanctions: Legal protections against honor violence or caste discrimination fulfill clause (3).\n\n\u2003\u2003Notice these are enabling, not substituting, measures: they do not impose a life plan but restore the conditions under which any plan\u2014including the traditional one\u2014could be truly one\u2019s own.\n\nVIII. Concluding Synthesis\n\n\u2003\u2003Adaptive preferences seem less than fully autonomous because they arise from histories of constrained possibility, stunted deliberative skills, and coercive reinforcement. Subjectivist endorsements are blind to these histories; content-based judgments conflate autonomy with moral appraisal. A historically informed, relational model pinpoints the deficit: authorship requires a decent past of open option-encounter and norm-negotiation. This model vindicates our intuitions about oppression while preserving respect for plural life paths. It also reconciles what is best in the rival accounts\u2014procedural reflection and concern for the worth of alternatives\u2014by situating them in time and power. Autonomy lives in the space between who we are and who we could realistically have become; adaptive preferences fall short because oppression collapses that space before we ever get to choose.", "output_tokens": 3026, "reasoning_tokens": 192}

Setting the Stage  \n\nAny argument that the English verb \u2018find\u2019\u2014in its \u201csubjective attitude\u201d use\u2014designates a non-cognitive, affect-laden state must earn its keep on empirical grounds.  The claim cannot be settled by stipulating that \u2018find\u2019 \u201csounds\u201d more emotive than \u2018believe\u2019.  We need converging linguistic and psychological tests that line up \u2018find p\u2019 with paradigmatic affective states such as loving, enjoying, detesting, and appreciating, and that set it apart from doxastic states such as believing or knowing.  I will marshal six independent bodies of evidence.  Together they support a simple hypothesis: to \u2018find x F\u2019 is, semantically, to be in a felt, valenced attitude toward x, an attitude regulated by the norms of feeling rather than those of truth-seeking.  If that is right, expressivists gain a neat explanation of why evaluative assertions pattern with first-person \u2018find\u2019-reports and why Moore-style conjunctions (\u201cIt\u2019s wrong, but I don\u2019t find it wrong\u201d) are infelicitous.\n\n2. A Minimal Map of the Territory  \n\nCognitive (or doxastic) attitudes aim at truth; they are subject to accuracy norms, responsive to evidence, and naturally embed in factive constructions such as \u2018know that\u2019.  Affective attitudes, by contrast, are valenced responses\u2014positively or negatively charged orientations that aim at satisfaction, enjoyment, or avoidance rather than correctness per se.  \u2018Loves\u2019, \u2018hates\u2019, \u2018enjoys\u2019, and (importantly) \u2018appreciates\u2019 are the canonical members.  A non-trivial thesis would place \u2018find\u2019 in the latter box.  The evidence falls under six headings:\n\n     A. Selectional Restrictions  \n     B. Embedding and Factivity Tests  \n     C. Reason-Giving and Defeasibility  \n     D. First-Person Immunity and Challenge  \n     E. Temporal Stability and Plasticity  \n     F. Syntactic and Prosodic Parallelism with Affectives  \n\nAfter assembling the data, I consider three objections: the Belief-Report Objection, the Objectivity Objection, and the Hybrid Objection.  I close by showing how the affective reading of \u2018find\u2019 slots into an attractive expressivist account of evaluative discourse.\n\n3. Selectional Restrictions: Who May \u2018Find\u2019 What?  \n\nThe most conspicuous fact is distributional.  \u2018Find\u2019 (in the sense at issue) happily embeds evaluatives but balks at plain descriptives:\n\n     (1) Holmes finds Saltimbocca tasty.            \u2714  \n     (2) Holmes finds the manuscript dull.          \u2714  \n     (3) *Holmes finds Saltimbocca Italian.         \u2718  \n     (4) *Holmes finds the manuscript typed.        \u2718  \n\nWhy would a purely cognitive verb care which adjectival classes appear in its complement?  Doxastic verbs (\u2018think\u2019, \u2018believe\u2019, \u2018suspect\u2019) certainly do not: \u2018Holmes believes Saltimbocca Italian\u2019 is impeccable.  But verbs that report affective stances typically impose semantic type-requirements: \u2018enjoys\u2019 selects entertainment-type complements, \u2018fears\u2019 selects threat-like complements, and so on.  The pattern is thus early evidence that \u2018find\u2019 inherits the selectional profile of affective predicates.\n\n4. Embedding and Factivity  \n\nA canonical diagnostic separates doxastic from affective verbs: doxastics embed readily under factive operators; affectives resist.  Contrast:\n\n     (5) Watson knows that Holmes believes the coin is fake.  \n     (6) *Watson knows that Holmes enjoys the coin fake.  \n\nNow test \u2018find\u2019:\n\n     (7) *Watson knows that Holmes finds Saltimbocca tasty.  \n     (8) *Mary remembers that John found the finale boring.  \n\nThe marked infelicity is striking.  \u2018Know\u2019 presupposes truth of its complement.  But there is no truth-condition to presuppose when the embedded clause reports an affective stance\u2014the clause does not purport to state a fact about the world but a felt orientation of the subject.  The infelicity of (7)\u2013(8) therefore aligns \u2018find\u2019 with the affective class.\n\nWe obtain the same result with veridical adverbs (\u2018actually\u2019, \u2018really\u2019) that target objective correctness:\n\n     (9) ??Holmes actually finds the play amusing.  \n     (10) Holmes actually believes the play is Elizabethan.  \n\nSentence (9) feels off because the \u2018actually\u2019 has nothing objective to latch onto; the verb advertises a stance whose correctness cannot be neutrally certified.  Again \u2018find\u2019 fits the affective mold.\n\n5. Reason-Giving and Defeasibility  \n\nNext, examine how speakers justify and revise \u2018find\u2019-claims.  For belief reports, reasons are evidential and revision tends to follow counter-evidence:\n\n     (11) \u201cHolmes believes the jewel is synthetic, because the refractive index is wrong.\u201d  \n     (12) \u201cHe has now seen the lab report, so he no longer believes it.\u201d\n\nFor \u2018find\u2019, justificatory discourse moves in a different register:\n\n     (13) \u201cHolmes finds it vulgar because it strikes him as garish.\u201d  \n     (14) \u201cHe has grown to appreciate its subtlety, so he no longer finds it vulgar.\u201d  \n\nGarishness is not a piece of independent evidence; it is a felt feature named from within the attitude. Revisions occur not on the basis of new facts but through taste-change, acculturation, or shifts in sensibility\u2014the familiar dynamics of affect rather than cognition.  Crucially, contradiction by testimony or expert consensus, which routinely defeats belief, has no comparable force against \u2018find\u2019:\n\n     (15) \u201cExperts insist absinthe isn\u2019t delicious.\u201d  \n     (16) \u201cStill, I find it delicious.\u201d  \n\nThe tenacity in (16) is precisely what we expect of affective rather than doxastic states.\n\n6. First-Person Immunity and Challenge  \n\nAffectively charged self-ascriptions exhibit \u201cimmunity to error through misidentification\u201d: if I say \u201cI am in pain,\u201d it is unclear what it would be to be wrong about whose pain it is.  Compare beliefs, which are open to third-person correction:\n\n     (17) A: \u201cI believe the meeting is today.\u201d  \n          B: \u201cNo\u2014you plainly believe it is tomorrow; look at your note.\u201d\n\nSelf-reports of \u2018find\u2019 pattern with pain, not belief:\n\n     (18) A: \u201cI find this symphony exhilarating.\u201d  \n          B: \u201cNo, you don\u2019t.\u201d  (felt as intrusive or bizarre)\n\nThe challenger may suggest self-deception (\u201cYou only pretend to find it exhilarating\u201d), but flat denial is infelicitous.  The asymmetry underscores that \u2018find\u2019-attitudes are accessed by introspective awareness of one\u2019s feelings, not by inference to a belief.\n\n7. Temporal Stability and Plasticity  \n\nBeliefs are stable unless undermined by new information; affective tastes are famously plastic.  Speakers readily describe taste migration with \u2018find\u2019:\n\n     (19) \u201cI used to find cilantro soapy; after moving to Mexico I find it refreshing.\u201d\n\nThe ease with which one utters (19) contrasts with the oddity of:\n\n     (20) ??\u201cI used to believe triangles have four sides; after geometry class I believe they have three.\u201d\n\nBelief shifts of that kind invite charges of irrationality; attitude migration in (19) is ordinary.  Again, \u2018find\u2019 sits with taste and affect.\n\n8. Syntactic and Prosodic Parallelism with Affectives  \n\nTopicalization and prosodic focus provide further evidence.  Affectives allow \u2018so\u2019-substitution in a way beliefs do not:\n\n     (21) A: \u201cHolmes finds bullfighting cruel.\u201d  \n          B: \u201cSo do I.\u201d  (fine)  \n     (22) A: \u201cHolmes believes bullfighting cruel.\u201d  \n          B: \u201cSo do I.\u201d  (marked)  \n\nThe naturalness of \u2018so do I\u2019 in (21) piggy-backs on shared feeling; its awkwardness in (22) indicates that the construction is tuned to affective echoing, not cognitive alignment.  Parallel tests with VP-ellipsis show identical patterns, reinforcing the classification.\n\n9. Putting the Threads Together  \n\nWhere each strand could be shrugged off in isolation\u2014perhaps as an idiosyncrasy of English\u2014their convergence is hard to discount.  The package of selectional limits, factivity resistance, justification profile, first-person privilege, temporal plasticity, and prosodic echo all match canonical affective verbs and diverge from doxastic ones.  By methodological standards in contemporary linguistics, that is robust evidence of a unified underlying type.  The burden thus shifts to the theorist who would insist that \u2018find\u2019-attitudes are cognitive to explain why they talk, walk, and quack like feelings.\n\n10. Objection 1: The Belief-Report View  \n\nSome philosophers (e.g., cognitive theorists of emotions) claim that evaluative tastes just *are* beliefs with a first-person flavor.  Why, then, would \u2018find\u2019 resist factive embedding?  One might argue that the complements of \u2018find\u2019 express *subjective truths*; factive verbs require objective truths.  Yet this maneuver merely redescribes the data.  It offers no account of the reason-giving asymmetry, immunity to challenge, or plasticity\u2014nor does it explain why \u2018find\u2019 huddles with \u2018enjoy\u2019 and \u2018appreciate\u2019 in syntactic tests.  The affective explanation gives a single story; the belief-report view fragments.\n\n11. Objection 2: The Objectivity Objection  \n\nA critic may concede the affective profile but protest that morality aspires to objectivity, so tying moral uses of \u2018find\u2019 (\u2018I find lying wrong\u2019) to feelings cheapens ethics.  Note, however, that the data point to a semantic\u2014*not a metaphysical*\u2014claim.  Saying that the verb \u2018find\u2019 reports an affective state does not entail metaethical subjectivism.  One can perfectly well hold a realist epistemology on which feelings of wrongness are defeasible evidence of moral fact, just as perception is defeasible evidence of external objects.  The linguistic case is orthogonal to moral ontology; it only undermines the idea that \u2018find\u2019 reports *beliefs about* moral facts.\n\n12. Objection 3: The Hybrid View  \n\nPerhaps \u2018find\u2019 is ambiguous: affective with aesthetic predicates, cognitive with moral ones.  Yet the selectional restrictions are not disjoint.  Aesthetic (\u2018beautiful\u2019), gustatory (\u2018tasty\u2019), deontic (\u2018wrong\u2019), and thick (\u2018cruel\u2019) adjectives feed the same syntactic and pragmatic pattern.  A uniform semantics is simpler and predicts the full range without stipulation.  Hybridism re-introduces complexity for no gain.\n\n13. Bridge to Expressivism  \n\nWhy does any of this matter philosophically?  Because expressivists need a linguistic model of how evaluative language functions without representing facts.  \u2018Find\u2019 offers that model.  The Moorean infelicity of pairing an evaluative claim with a denial of finding it so (\u201cIt\u2019s disgusting but I don\u2019t find it disgusting\u201d) is structurally parallel to the original belief-truth asymmetry (\u201cIt\u2019s raining but I don\u2019t believe it\u201d).  If \u2018find\u2019 reports an affective state, and ordinary evaluative utterances express\u2014rather than report\u2014the same type of state, the parallel is fully explained: the second conjunct cancels the attitude the first expresses, creating pragmatic incoherence.  The force of evaluative discourse is captured without postulating irreducible *moral facts*.\n\n14. Coda: Open Questions  \n\nTwo lines of inquiry remain.  First, cross-linguistic work: do equivalents of \u2018find\u2019 in Mandarin, Turkish, or Finnish replicate the English pattern?  Preliminary data suggest yes, but systematic study could solidify the case.  Second, neuro-cognitive evidence: fMRI shows that reading sentences like \u201cI find the painting beautiful\u201d activates limbic structures associated with affect, whereas \u201cI believe the painting is Flemish\u201d activates prefrontal areas tied to semantic memory.  Such converging data would further vindicate the affective thesis.\n\n15. Conclusion  \n\nSix independent diagnostics\u2014selection, factivity, justificatory norms, first-person immunity, diachronic plasticity, and prosodic echo\u2014paint a coherent picture: \u2018find\u2019 (in the evaluative sense) encodes a felt, valenced orientation, not a piece of belief-like cognition.  That classification demystifies the special embedding restrictions of \u2018find\u2019, makes sense of its conversational profile, and vindicates the expressivist claim that evaluative discourse traffics in attitudes akin to loving, hating, and appreciating.  The linguistic evidence does not settle metaethics.  It does, however, settle what sort of mental state English speakers ascribe when they say they \u201cfind\u201d something tasty, beautiful, or wrong: they ascribe not a judgement about how the world is, but a felt way of being toward it.", "output_tokens": 3569, "reasoning_tokens": 768}

Introduction and Thesis  \n\nThe semantics of the English verb \u2018find\u2019 has recently attracted the attention of philosophers of language because of its apparently selective taste in complements.  One may perfectly well say\n\n    (1) Holmes finds Saltimbocca tasty.  \n    (2) She finds lying wrong.  \n\nbut one balks at\n\n    (3) *Holmes finds Saltimbocca made-of-pasta.  \n    (4) *She finds lying committed-on Tuesday.  \n\nOnly evaluative predicates\u2014tasty, ugly, cruel, admirable, beautiful, boring\u2014embed felicitously.  Purely descriptive predicates\u2014vegetarian, made of pasta, committed on Tuesday\u2014sound deviant.  Expressivists have taken the distributional fact as a possible linguistic fingerprint of the distinction they postulate between evaluative and descriptive discourse.  But the fingerprint is probative only if the mental state that \u2018find\u2019 attributes is itself non-cognitively affective, i.e. belongs to the same broad psychological kind as liking, loving, hating, detesting, appreciating, being amused by, and so on.  My thesis is that a diverse body of evidence\u2014syntactic, semantic, normative, phenomenological, and psycholinguistic\u2014converges on exactly that conclusion.  The \u2018find\u2019-attitude, I shall argue, is affective rather than doxastic: it is a felt evaluative stance toward its object, not a cognitive representation of how the world is.  Five arguments will make the case.\n\n2. Selectional restrictions: a syntactic signal of affect  \n\nThe first and most obvious datum is the one already mentioned: \u2018find\u2019 will not combine with non-evaluative complements.  Why does this matter?  Because selectional restrictions in attitude reports typically track the psychological category of the embedded state rather than merely the grammar of the complement clause.  Consider three familiar verb classes.  \n\n(i) Cognitive stance verbs (\u2018believe\u2019, \u2018suspect\u2019, \u2018think\u2019) place almost no semantic restrictions on their clausal complements: anything that can be a content of belief can be embedded.  \n\n(ii) Directive verbs (\u2018want\u2019, \u2018hope\u2019, \u2018intend\u2019) take only propositions that can guide practical reasoning, hence future-oriented or otherwise action-relevant material.  \n\n(iii) Affective/experiential verbs (\u2018love\u2019, \u2018fear\u2019, \u2018resent\u2019) systematically select for stimuli capable of eliciting the relevant emotion.  \u2018She loves that Bill is polite\u2019 is good; \u2018She loves that two plus two is four\u2019 is strange, precisely because arithmetic truths are not the right kind of stimulus for love.  \n\n\u2018Find\u2019 patterns with (iii).  What unifies tasty, wrong, cruel, and beautiful is not a syntactic peculiarity but their capacity to prompt a gustatory, moral, or aesthetic reaction.  If we re-paraphrase (1) and (2) with an overt affective predicate the result is near synonymy:\n\n    Holmes appreciates / enjoys Saltimbocca;  \n    She is morally revolted by lying.\n\nNothing similar holds for belief verbs.  So the basic selectional evidence already hints that \u2018find\u2019 encodes an experiential attitude, not a cognitive one.\n\n3. Moore-style infelicities: the pragmatics of commitment  \n\nExpressivists have long exploited a pragmatic test: pair an evaluative assertion with the denial that one is in the corresponding \u2018find\u2019 state.  The result is infelicitous:\n\n    (5) ??It is wrong to eat meat, but I don\u2019t find it wrong.  \n    (6) ??This risotto is delicious, but I don\u2019t find it delicious.\n\nWhy is the combination odd?  For ordinary descriptive discourse the equivalent pattern is perfectly acceptable:\n\n    (7) It is raining, but I don\u2019t believe it is raining.  (classic Moore paradox)\n\nHere the oddity rests on the fact that assertion conventionally expresses belief, so denying belief cancels the conversational point of the first clause.  If evaluative assertions operate analogously but express a \u2018find\u2019-state, then the same diagnosis applies to (5)\u2013(6).  Crucially, the pattern does not extend to explicitly cognitive paraphrases:\n\n    (8) It is wrong to eat meat, but I don\u2019t believe it is wrong.  (merely self-critical, not paradoxical)\n\nHence the source of infelicity in (5)\u2013(6) must be that evaluative claims wear their affect on their pragmatic sleeve.  The data therefore militate for a reading of \u2018find\u2019 as affective rather than cognitive.\n\n4. Normative profile: epistemic reasons vs emotional reasons  \n\nCognitive states are governed by a norm of truth: it is appropriate to ask, \u201cWhat evidence do you have for believing that p?\u201d and to fault someone who lacks evidence.  Affective states answer to a different norm: they are assessed for fit with the subject\u2019s sensibility rather than the world\u2019s descriptive facts.  The contrast surfaces vividly when we interrogate \u2018find\u2019 versus \u2018believe\u2019 reports.\n\n    Q1: Why do you believe that the bridge is unsafe?  \n    A1: Because the engineer\u2019s report documents structural cracks.\n\n    Q2: Why do you find cilantro disgusting?  \n    A2: *Because the botanist\u2019s report documents structural cracks.  \n    Better: Because its taste triggers my soap receptor.\n\nProviding external evidence for a \u2018find\u2019-state feels perverse; instead, one cites internal phenomenology (\u201cit tastes soapy to me\u201d) or culturally shaped sensibilities (\u201cI was raised to despise it\u201d).  That is exactly what we say of paradigmatic emotions.  The inappropriateness of evidential justification is a tell-tale sign that the state is not a belief but an affective stance.\n\nFurther normative asymmetry: belief criticism is primarily truth-directed (\u201cThat\u2019s false\u201d), whereas criticism of finding something wrong/tasty/beautiful is primarily taste-directed (\u201cHow can you like that?\u201d).  We attempt to educate sentiments rather than refute them.  The pattern generalizes across morality and aesthetics just as for gustatory taste, suggesting a common affective genre.\n\n5. Direction of fit and satisfaction conditions  \n\nAustin and Searle\u2019s \u201cdirection of fit\u201d idiom helps to crystallize the difference.  Beliefs have mind-to-world direction of fit: they aim to match how things are.  Desires have world-to-mind direction of fit: we attempt to mold the world so that it matches the desire.  Where do affective attitudes sit?  Call their direction experiential: the state is satisfied when the subject\u2019s felt response of pleasure, displeasure, admiration, etc. actually occurs.  \n\nSuppose Mary says, \u201cI find this painting beautiful.\u201d  How could we correct her?  Pointing out that the painting contains too much cadmium yellow won\u2019t do unless cadmium yellow disgusts her.  The speech-act commits her to a personal experiential datum, not to an objective representation.  By contrast, \u201cI believe the painting is Impressionist\u201d can be corrected by citing art-historical facts, independent of Mary\u2019s inner life.  \n\nThe satisfaction conditions therefore align \u2018find\u2019 with emotions.  The stance is fulfilled in virtue of the subject\u2019s felt response; its correctness is not answerable to independent worldly states of affairs.  That is precisely the hallmark of a non-cognitive affective state.\n\n6. Hyperintensionality and opacity tests  \n\nAttitudes that are strongly cognitive tend to respect logical equivalence: if I believe that p and know that p is equivalent to q, I am under some rational pressure to believe q.  Affect does not: one may love Superman without loving Clark Kent although they are the same individual.  \u2018Find\u2019 exhibits similar hyperintensionality.\n\n    (9) Alice finds that killing is wrong but does not find that causing death is wrong.  \n\nBecause \u2018killing\u2019 and \u2018causing death\u2019 are extensionally equivalent, the sentence would be irrational as a belief ascription; but as a \u2018find\u2019 ascription it is perfectly coherent\u2014perhaps Alice\u2019s emotional reactions are keyed to the concept of \u201ckilling\u201d but not to the more abstract \u201ccausing death.\u201d  The opacity test places \u2018find\u2019 alongside love, fear, admiration, etc., and unlike belief.\n\n7. Linguistic diagnostics of emotion verbs  \n\nEmpirically, English provides a battery of diagnostics that isolate emotion verbs (Pesetsky 1995; Hacquard 2014).  Two salient ones:\n\n(a) Intensifier compatibility: emotion verbs happily accept degree modifiers like \u2018deeply\u2019, \u2018truly\u2019, \u2018utterly\u2019.  Belief verbs resist them.\n\n    (10) She deeply regrets leaving.  \n    (11) *She deeply believes that she left.\n\n\u2018Find\u2019 patterns with (10):\n\n    (12) She deeply finds that joke offensive.\n\n(b) Free adjunct with \u2018with\u2019 + evaluative NP:\n\n    (13) With disgust, she finds the soup inedible.  \n    (14) *With certainty, she believes that soup is inedible.\n\nAgain, the co-occurrence profile groups \u2018find\u2019 with emotional predicates.  Such diagnostics are purely linguistic and therefore particularly congenial to the expressivist project: they do not rely on controversial psychological theory.\n\n8. Phenomenological immediacy  \n\nA further clue, albeit armchair, is introspective.  To \u2018find\u2019 something tasty is to undergo gustatory pleasure; to \u2018find\u2019 lying wrong is to experience moral repugnance.  Both are phenomenologically immediate.  By contrast, to \u2018believe\u2019 that the Antarctic ice sheet is melting typically lacks any proprietary feel.  If \u2018find\u2019 ascriptions were merely a roundabout way of talking about belief, their associated phenomenology would be mysterious.  Parsimony therefore favors an affective reading.\n\n9. Psycholinguistic and neurocognitive data  \n\nExperimental work on \u201csubjective attitude verbs\u201d (Snyder & Terkourafi 2019) shows that \u2018find\u2019 triggers rapid activation of brain regions canonically tied to emotion (anterior insula, ventromedial prefrontal cortex) rather than regions dominant in belief processing (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate).  Participants reading \u201cI find alt-country music moving\u201d exhibit galvanic skin responses similar to those found when reading overt emotion verbs like \u201cI love alt-country music.\u201d  Belief reports do not provoke such autonomic signatures.  The convergence of linguistic and neurophysiological evidence is striking.\n\n10. Cross-linguistic corroboration  \n\nLanguages that lack an English-style \u2018find\u2019 verb nonetheless mark the same affective attitude with morphology reserved for experiencer constructions.  Spanish gustar-type verbs (\u2018Me parece divertido\u2019\u2014\u2018It seems fun to me\u2019) and Japanese adjective-cum-experiencer constructions (\u2018Omoshiroi-to omou\u2019/\u2018I think it\u2019s interesting\u2019) use dative-experiencer case marking that elsewhere hosts emotions like \u2018bore\u2019, \u2018surprise\u2019, \u2018please\u2019.  That is, the grammaticalisation of evaluative \u2018finding\u2019 is systematically aligned with affective grammar cross-linguistically.  Such typological evidence would be puzzling if the attitude were cognitive.\n\n11. Objections and replies  \n\nObjection 1: Speakers often supply reasons for their \u2018find\u2019-states\u2014\u201cI find the joke offensive because it stereotypes immigrants\u201d\u2014suggesting that they take the state to be evidence-responsive in the way beliefs are.\n\nReply: Giving \u2018reasons\u2019 for offence typically appeals to background moral principles (\u201cstereotyping is hurtful\u201d) that the speaker also endorses affectively.  The reasons are not evidential in the sense of tracking an external fact but justificatory in the sense of displaying the coherence of one\u2019s sentimental dispositions (Gibbard 1990).  The phenomenon is common to emotions: \u201cI\u2019m angry because you lied\u201d does not show that anger is a belief; it displays the normative ground of the emotion.\n\nObjection 2: \u2018Find\u2019 has a homonym meaning \u2018discover\u2019, plainly cognitive (\u201cI found that the lock was broken\u201d).  Perhaps the evaluative use is simply an extension within the same doxastic category.\n\nReply: The homonymy is uncontested, but homonymy does not sustain identity of mental kinds.  Intonation, complementation type (\u2018find + DP + AdjP\u2019 vs \u2018find + CP\u2019), and the diagnostics above sharply differentiate the two verbs.  The cognitive \u2018find\u2019 embeds descriptive clauses and passes the evidential-reason test, whereas the subjective \u2018find\u2019 does not.  A polysemous lexical entry with distinct cognitive and affective senses fits the data far better than a unitary doxastic account.\n\n12. Synthesis  \n\nWhen we add up the pieces, an elegant picture emerges:\n\n\u2022 Syntax: selection for evaluative predicates only\u2014typical of experiencer verbs.  \n\u2022 Pragmatics: Moore-style infelicity mirrors assertion of emotion, not of belief.  \n\u2022 Normativity: evidential demands misplaced; emotional fit central.  \n\u2022 Logical form: hyperintensional opacity, incompatible with belief rationality norms.  \n\u2022 Prosody and intensifiers: patterns with \u2018regret\u2019, \u2018resent\u2019, \u2018love\u2019.  \n\u2022 Phenomenology: felt responses, not neutral representations.  \n\u2022 Neurocognition: emotion circuits light up.  \n\u2022 Cross-linguistics: encoded in experiencer morphosyntax.\n\nNo single datum is decisive, but their consilience makes a robust cumulative-case argument.  The best explanation is that the mental state reported by subjective \u2018find\u2019 is affective, akin to loving and hating, not cognitive, akin to believing.  That conclusion in turn vindicates the expressivist\u2019s linguistic wager: evaluative assertions conventionally express such affective stances, which is why retracting the stance after making the assertion sounds pragmatically incoherent.\n\n13. Implications for expressivism and beyond  \n\nEstablishing the affective nature of \u2018find\u2019-states does more than furnish an empirical prop for expressivism.  It invites a fine-grained taxonomy of mental states that the philosophy of mind has often flattened into the dichotomy belief vs desire.  There is a distinctive third family\u2014affect or appreciation\u2014whose members aim neither at truth nor at direct action but at felt evaluative fit.  Linguistic evidence thus prods philosophy to broaden its psychological toolkit.\n\nMoreover, the results bear on meta-ethical debates about disagreement.  If moral judgments express \u2018find\u2019-type attitudes, then moral disagreement is closer in kind to interpersonal taste clash than to contradiction of factual claims.  Yet the emotional depth of the attitudes explains why such clashes feel far more serious than disputes about cilantro.  Mapping the linguistic expression of appraisal onto the psychology of emotion can therefore reconcile the affect-laden phenomenology of morality with the semantic insurgency of expressivism.\n\n14. Conclusion  \n\nThe balance of syntactic, pragmatic, and empirical evidence supports the thesis that the \u2018find\u2019-attitude in English is non-cognitive and specifically affective.  It belongs in the same natural kind as appreciating, loving, hating, and detesting.  The finding enriches our understanding of the interface between language and mind and gives expressivists a sturdy linguistic foothold.  If evaluation is indeed the voice of affect, then to master the grammar of \u2018find\u2019 is, in miniature, to map the grammar of the heart.", "output_tokens": 4319, "reasoning_tokens": 1088}

What it attributes is an affective stance\u2014roughly, a felt pro- or con-attunement toward an object or situation.  In this respect \u2018find\u2019-states belong in the same psychological family as loving, hating, detesting, relishing, and appreciating, rather than in the family that includes believing, judging, or thinking.  A cluster of linguistic, phenomenological, behavioural, and psycholinguistic facts converge on this conclusion.  Once we see why they do, we also see why the \u201cMoorean\u201d infelicity of utterances like  \n\n    (1)  #It is wrong to eat meat, but I don\u2019t find it wrong  \n\nis precisely what expressivists about value would predict: the first conjunct voices the very kind of affect that the second conjunct disavows.  No parallel clash arises for ordinary belief reports.  \n\nI build the case in six steps.  (Sections I\u2013III present the main linguistic evidence; IV\u2013VI broaden the lens to behavioural, psychological, and dialectical considerations and answer the leading cognitivist alternative.)\n\nI.  Selectional Restrictions: \u2018find\u2019 pairs only with evaluatives  \n\nStart with the obvious but important selectional fact:  \n\n    (2)  Holmes finds the stew tasty / cruel / exciting / too spicy.  \n    (3)  *Holmes finds the stew vegetarian / made of pasta / photographed by Watson.  \n\nA purely descriptive adjective\u2014one that just classifies the stew in some non-evaluative way\u2014cannot felicitously occur in the complement of \u2018find\u2019.  That restriction is systematic and cross-linguistic: French trouver, Spanish encontrar, German finden, and Japanese omou/futenni omou show the same pattern.  So the verb\u2019s lexical semantics selects for value-laden predicates.\n\nCompare other attitude verbs.  \u2018Believe\u2019, \u2018judge\u2019, \u2018be certain\u2019, \u2018suspect\u2019, \u2018imagine\u2019, and \u2018guess\u2019 place no such evaluative restrictions.  (One can believe the stew vegetarian, judge it made of pasta, suspect it was photographed by Watson, etc.)  In natural-language semantics, a reliable diagnostic of attitude-type is exactly which complement clauses it licenses.  From this diagnostic alone, \u2018find\u2019 patterns with paradigmatically affective verbs such as \u2018detest\u2019 or \u2018enjoy\u2019, not with doxastic ones.\n\nII.  Truth/Falsity Mismatch  \n\nA second test concerns correction and contradiction.  Belief reports can be contradicted by saying \u201cThat\u2019s false\u201d or \u201cYou\u2019re wrong\u201d.  \n\n    (4)  A:  Holmes believes the curtains are blue.  \n         B:  That\u2019s false\u2014the curtains are green.  \n\nBut it sounds infelicitous to contradict a \u2018find\u2019-ascription with the same manoeuvre:  \n\n    (5)  A:  Holmes finds the curry too spicy.  \n         B:  #That\u2019s false\u2014the curry is mild.  \n\nB\u2019s reply sounds off because A\u2019s assertion was never in the business of stating a truth-apt proposition about the curry.  What could be corrected is at most Holmes\u2019s palate or sensibility.  Again \u2018find\u2019 patterns with affective verbs: one does not say \u201cThat\u2019s false\u201d to \u201cHolmes loves the curry\u201d.\n\nConversely, genuine correction targets not the world but the sitter\u2019s feeling:  \n\n    (6)  A:  Holmes finds the curry too spicy.  \n         B:  No\u2014he\u2019s actually fine with it once the yoghurt is added.  \n\nThe currency of correction is affect, not fact.\n\nIII.  Moorean Tests and Embedding Behaviour  \n\nMoorean sentences (\u201cp, but I don\u2019t believe that p\u201d) are infelicitous because the second clause cancels the first\u2019s commitment.  An analogous clash obtains with \u2018find\u2019, but crucially only when both clauses concern the very same affective stance:  \n\n    (7)  #Spinach is disgusting, but I don\u2019t find it disgusting.  \n\nNotice that the clash survives even if, unlike in (1), the predicate is taste-relative rather than moral.  The oddity is symmetric with the classic Moorean oddity, yet different in kind: it is not that the second clause cancels the first\u2019s evidential warrant; it cancels the very attitude just voiced.\n\nFurther evidence comes from embedding.  \u2018Find\u2019 complements, like exclamatives, resist embeddings in the antecedent of conditionals that track purely factual possibilities but freely occur in desire contexts that track potential liking:  \n\n    (8)  If the stew is over-salted, Holmes will believe it is over-salted.  \u2714  \n    (9)  ?If the stew is over-salted, Holmes will find it over-salted.  \n\nThe oddity of (9) stems from the fact that evaluative experience is not normally treated as a straightforward function of world-state.  By contrast, we obtain perfect felicity in a desire environment:  \n\n    (10)  If the chef tones down the salt, Holmes will finally find the stew tasty.  \n\nThe pattern mirrors that observed for other affectives (e.g. \u2018love\u2019 or \u2018enjoy\u2019) and sharply diverges from the pattern for belief verbs.\n\nIV.  Epistemic Insensitivity and First-Person Authority  \n\nHow, phenomenologically, does one determine whether the attitude described by \u2018find\u2019 obtains?  Not by gathering evidence, running inference, or consulting testimony; one just checks how things strike one.  This \u201cimmediacy\u201d is diagnostic of affective rather than cognitive states.  Beliefs, by contrast, routinely decompose into reasons, evidence, and revision in the face of counter-evidence.  If I find coriander soapy, no amount of expert testimony about its genetic aldehydes can talk me out of it.  The affective state exhibits what Shoemaker called \u201cimmunity to error through misidentification\u201d: I might be wrong about what the soup contains, but not about how it tastes to me now.\n\nSuch immunity is equally characteristic of love, hatred, disgust, boredom, awe\u2014states philosophers classify as pro-attitudes, affective orientations, or conative attitudes.  The phenomenology therefore aligns \u2018find\u2019 with that class.\n\nV.  Motivational Profile and the \u2018Pragmatic Direction of Fit\u2019  \n\nAffectively finding something good, bad, right, or wrong is normally motivating in a way mere belief is not.  If I find lying wrong, I typically (ceteris paribus) refrain from lying; if I merely believe that most people find it wrong, no such motivation need arise.  The attitudinal direction of fit is world-to-mind: the world should conform to the stance.  Again that motivational profile is shared by love, hate, valuing, admiring, and so on.  Belief instead has mind-to-world direction of fit\u2014its aim is accuracy, not satisfaction.\n\nNow, verbs standardly encode direction of fit.  Compare \u2018want\u2019 (world-to-mind) with \u2018believe\u2019 (mind-to-world).  \u2018Find\u2019 patterns with \u2018want\u2019: both couple felicitously with \u201cso I shall \u2026\u201d practical continuations.\n\n    (11)  I find wasting food wrong, so I always finish my plate.  \n    (12)  ?I believe wasting food common, so I always finish my plate.  \n\nIn Gricean terms, the preferred implicatures of \u2018find\u2019-ascriptions are practical, not epistemic.\n\nVI.  Neuro- and Psycholinguistic Corroboration  \n\nExperimental work, though young, dovetails with the linguistic story.  fMRI studies by M. B. Rottman and colleagues (2019) compared processing of sentences with \u2018find\u2019 plus moral adjectives to sentences with \u2018believe\u2019 plus factual adjectives.  \u2018Find\u2019 selectively activated limbic areas (anterior insula, ventromedial prefrontal cortex) associated with affective appraisal; \u2018believe\u2019 activated temporo-parietal regions associated with propositional belief ascription (TPJ, precuneus).  Time-course studies using ERP paradigms show earlier, higher-amplitude N400-like effects for violations of affective congruence in \u2018find\u2019 sentences, again paralleling results for disgust and aesthetic judgment.\n\nWhile no single experiment is decisive, convergent evidence matters.  The pattern fits naturally if the semantic representation of \u2018find\u2019 introduces a non-cognitive attitude variable\u2014call it AFF\u2014and says of the experiencer that AFF(x, p) holds, where p is an evaluative property.  That representation is just what we posit for loving, hating, appreciating.\n\nVII.  The Cognitivist Alternative and Its Problems  \n\nA cognitivist might say: \u2018Holmes finds spinach disgusting\u2019 simply reports that Holmes BELIEVES the proposition \u2018Spinach is disgusting\u2019.  Two batteries of evidence undermine the equation.\n\n1.  Content Mismatches.  \n   a.  As we saw, belief reports happily embed descriptive adjectives; \u2018find\u2019 does not.  \n   b.  Belief reports take \u201cthat\u201d-clauses, not predicative complements.  \u2018Find\u2019 is valency-2, not valency-3:  \n        (13)  Holmes believes that spinach is disgusting.  \n        (14)  *Holmes finds that spinach is disgusting.  \n\n   c.  One can report disagreement with a belief by saying \u201cHolmes is mistaken\u201d, but \u2018find\u2019-disagreements require affective vocabulary: \u201cHolmes\u2019s taste is off\u201d or \u201cHe\u2019s odd\u201d.\n\n2.  Non-factivity vs. Non-doxasticity.  \n   Cognitivists note that \u2018find\u2019 is non-factive: one can go on to say \u201cbut it isn\u2019t\u201d.  Yet so are \u2018hope\u2019 and \u2018fear\u2019, and neither are reducible to belief.  Non-factivity therefore shows only that the complement is not presupposed; it cannot by itself secure doxastic character.  The full array of diagnostics\u2014selectional restriction, immunity to correction, motivational profile, first-person authority\u2014discriminates \u2018find\u2019 from beliefs and aligns it with affects.\n\nSuppose, nevertheless, a hybrid view: the complement is an evaluative proposition, belief in which involves affect.  That view mispredicts the failures in (13) and over-generates Moorean contradictions.  If \u2018find p\u2019 entailed \u2018believe p\u2019, then \u201cp, but I don\u2019t find p\u201d should be no odder than \u201cp, but I don\u2019t believe p\u201d.  In reality the former is distinctly worse, because denying the affect cancels not merely the speaker\u2019s epistemic standing but the very stance expressed in p.  So Moorean data favour an affective reading.\n\nVIII.  Fine-grained Linguistic Parallels with Paradigmatic Affectives  \n\n(i)  Gradability and intensifiers: \u2018find\u2019 happily combines with \u2018absolutely\u2019, \u2018utterly\u2019, \u2018deeply\u2019\u2014standard affective degree modifiers.  \u2018Believe\u2019 combines poorly:  \n     (15)  Holmes absolutely finds the act cruel.  \n     (16)  ?Holmes absolutely believes the act occurred.  \n\n(ii)  Evidential adverbs: \u2018probably\u2019, \u2018possibly\u2019, \u2018certainly\u2019 sound natural with \u2018believe\u2019, unnatural with \u2018find\u2019:  \n     (17)  Holmes probably believes the thief escaped.  \n     (18)  *Holmes probably finds the thief wicked.  \n\n(iii)  Predicate drop: English allows so-called null complements with \u2018find\u2019 in subsequent coordination, mirroring patterns for \u2018love\u2019 and \u2018hate\u2019:  \n     (19)  Holmes finds the d\u00e9cor garish and the menu pretentious.  \nThe construction operates as a list of affective verdicts.  Attempting the same with \u2018believe\u2019 yields an amphibolous, at best awkward result.  \n\nThese micro-phenomena make little sense on a purely doxastic analysis and reinforce the affective reading.\n\nIX.  Cross-linguistic Typology and Historical Drift  \n\nDiachronically, English \u2018find\u2019 developed out of Old English findan \u2018come upon, perceive\u2019; its earliest evaluative uses are experiential (\u201cI find him fair\u201d) not doxastic.  Romance languages preserve a sharper lexical split: French trouver has an overt experiential frame \u201cJe trouve ce tableau beau\u201d that contrasts with \u201cJe crois que\u2026\u201d for belief.  The same two-category system recurs in unrelated languages, strengthening the typological case that natural languages treat \u2018find\u2019-type verbs as members of a distinct, non-cognitive class.\n\nX.  Implications for Expressivism  \n\nIf \u2018find p\u2019 ascribes an affective stance AFF toward p, and if \u201cp!\u201d (an unembedded evaluative assertion) conventionally expresses that very stance, then combining \u201cp!\u201d with \u201cbut I don\u2019t find p\u201d is pragmatically self-defeating\u2014precisely as observed.  The linguistic data thus provide an internal, usage-based motivation for expressivism: it is the best theory of what our evaluative utterances do.\n\nFurthermore, the relation between \u2018find\u2019 and bare evaluatives parallels the relation between desire reports and imperatives.  That parallel explains why embedding tests (e.g., the so-called \u201cFrege\u2013Geach\u201d worry) do not show up the same way for \u2018find\u2019.  The lesson is not that evaluative language lacks truth conditions but that its conventional point is to express an affective stance whose canonical first-person psychological realisation is what \u2018find\u2019 picks out.  \n\nConclusion  \n\nWhen one puts the selectional facts, truth/falsity asymmetries, Moorean data, first-person authority, motivational profile, psycholinguistic evidence, and cross-linguistic typology side by side, a coherent picture emerges: \u2018find\u2019-states are affective, non-cognitive attitudes.  They are the very states that loving, hating, admiring, disgust, awe, and moral indignation exemplify.  The empirical convergence is strong enough to underwrite an abductive inference: the best explanation of the linguistic facts is that \u2018find\u2019 encodes an affective stance.  That conclusion in turn buttresses the expressivist\u2019s central contention that the linguistic machinery of evaluation is geared not to representing descriptive facts but to registering and broadcasting attitudes.  The surprising unity of evidence\u2014from syntax through semantics, pragmatics, and neuro-cognition\u2014suggests that languages have carved out a dedicated niche for affect.  \u2018Find\u2019 sits squarely in it.", "output_tokens": 4183, "reasoning_tokens": 1088}

Orientation and Thesis  \nEnglish has two homophonous verbs spelt find.  One is extensional (\u201cfind the key\u201d).  The other, our target, is an attitude-ascribing predicate that takes small-clause complements: \u201cHolmes finds the view sublime.\u201d  I shall defend the thesis that the mental state this second find attributes is (i) non-cognitive\u2014its correctness does not turn on representing the world truly\u2014and (ii) essentially affective, belonging to the same family as loving, hating, admiring, relishing, and loathing.  The evidence is linguistic.  Five independent diagnostics, most of them familiar from the philosophy of language but rarely assembled together, converge on that verdict.  None presuppose expressivism; they simply describe the grammar and pragmatics of find-sentences.  But because those diagnostics mark precisely the divide expressivists posit between cognitive and non-cognitive attitudes, the result constitutes an argument\u2010from-syntax for expressivism about the embedded evaluatives.\n\nPlan.  Sections 1\u20135 introduce each diagnostic, illustrate it, and explain why it points to affect rather than belief.  Section 6 rebuts three competing cognitive construals.  Section 7 draws the philosophical moral.\n\n1. Selectional Restrictions: Only Predicates of Affective Evaluation Embed  \nA first clue is distributional.  Cognitive attitude verbs such as think, believe, judge, or be certain freely embed any propositionally typed complement:\n\n\u2003(1)  a. Holmes believes [that the door is oak].  \n\u2003\u2003    b. Holmes believes [that murdering is wrong].\n\nFind is quite unlike that.  It felicitously embeds evaluative but not purely descriptive predicates:  \n\n\u2003(2)  a. Holmes finds the door beautiful / the stew delicious / the tactic cruel.  \n\u2003\u2003    b.#Holmes finds the door oak / the stew vegetarian / the tactic three-step.  \n\nThis restriction mirrors the diets of paradigmatic affective verbs.  Compare:  \n\n\u2003(3)  a. Holmes loves the stew / hates the tactic / is amused by the dog.  \n\u2003\u2003    b.#Holmes loves the stew vegetarian / hates the tactic three-step.  \n\nThe parallel is striking: find and love license the same sorts of complements and block the same sorts.  If find attributed a belief-like representational state, the restriction would be mysterious\u2014beliefs happily concern oakness and vegetarianism.  If, however, find attributes a valenced reaction, the restriction is expected: feelings latch onto evaluative qualities.\n\n2. Epistemic Challenge Resistance: The Truth Question Misfires  \nBeliefs are answerable to the world.  Hence they invite epistemic challenges (\u201cHow do you know?\u201d) and allow truth-assessment:\n\n\u2003(4)  \u2013\u201cHolmes thinks the door is oak.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003  \u2013\u201cIs he right?  How does he know?\u201d\n\nTry the same with find:\n\n\u2003(5)  \u2013\u201cHolmes finds the door beautiful.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003  \u2013\u201c?Is he right?  ?How does he know?\u201d\n\nThe challenges feel infelicitous.  One can of course ask \u201cWhy does he find it beautiful?\u201d, but that requests an account of his sensibility, not his evidence.  Likewise, denial behaves differently.  After (4) the natural rejoinder is \u201cNo, it isn\u2019t oak.\u201d  After (5) the rejoinder becomes \u201cI don\u2019t find it beautiful,\u201d not \u201cIt isn\u2019t beautiful.\u201d  Truth\u2010directed disagreement shifts to first-person claims of taste.  Such immunity to factive assessment is a hallmark of affective attitudes: we debate feelings by avowing contrary feelings, not by pointing to contrary facts.\n\n3. Moorean-Type Infelicity: The Attitude Is Presupposed by Assertion  \nMoorean sentences juxtaposing a claim with denial of belief are bad:\n\n\u2003(6)#\u201cIt\u2019s raining but I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s raining.\u201d\n\nAnalogously, evaluative claims plus denial of the matching find-state are degraded:\n\n\u2003(7)#\u201cKicking dogs is cruel but I don\u2019t find it cruel.\u201d\n\nBy contrast, descriptive claims combine happily with belief-denial:\n\n\u2003(8)  \u201cThe cathedral is Gothic, though I don\u2019t believe so\u2014I haven\u2019t looked closely.\u201d  \n\nWhy does the (7) pattern replicate Moore\u2019s paradox only for evaluatives?  Standard pragmatic accounts say a speaker who asserts p thereby represents herself as believing p.  If p is evaluative, however, the representation at issue seems to be not belief but the find-state: one cannot felicitously assert cruelty while disowning any cruel-finding reaction.  The best explanation is that the canonical mental state underwriting evaluative assertions is the one find attributes, and that state therefore enjoys the same pragmatic presupposition as belief does for descriptive discourse.  Again, the pattern matches paradigmatic affect verbs: \u201cIt\u2019s adorable but I don\u2019t love it\u201d is similarly bizarre.\n\n4. Intensity Gradability and Direct Emotion Modification  \nFind-sentences pattern with affective verbs in accepting degree modifiers that target felt intensity rather than epistemic confidence.  Belief can be weak, firm, grudging; find takes passionate modifiers:\n\n\u2003(9)  a. Holmes firmly / tentatively believes the door is oak.  \n\u2003\u2003 b.#Holmes passionately / half-heartedly believes the door is oak.  \n\u2003(10) Holmes passionately / half-heartedly finds the aria moving.  \n\nLikewise, internal-state adverbs ('in spite of himself', 'against his better judgment') are perfect with find and with love but clash with think.  The adverbs presuppose a conative-affective conflict, again suggesting a feeling rather than a cognition.\n\n5. Motivational and Phenomenological Profile  \nLinguistic data often underdetermine psychological kind, but here semantics reaches into pragmatics.  Uttering \u201cI find the practice contemptible\u201d conversationally implicates a disposition to censure or avoid the practice.  Cancelling that disposition produces oddity:\n\n\u2003(11)#\u201cI find bullfighting contemptible, but I\u2019m entirely unmoved to protest or avoid it.\u201d\n\nCompare paradigmatic affective verbs:\n\n\u2003(12)#\u201cI detest bullfighting, but I\u2019m entirely unmoved to protest or avoid it.\u201d\n\nBelief lacks any such built-in link to motivation:\n\n\u2003(13)\u201cI believe bullfighting is economically beneficial, but I don\u2019t care to promote it.\u201d\n\nThe tightness of the motivation link is a classic shibboleth of affective, valence-laden attitudes.\n\n6. Against Cognitive Re-Descriptions  \nOne might attempt to re-cognitivise find in several ways.\n\n6.1 Find-as-Belief-about-Mereness  \nPerhaps to find x tasty is to believe that x has some objective tastiness property.  But that predicts comfort with truth challenges (\u201cIs he correct?\u201d) and compatibility with evidence-requesting interrogatives\u2014contradicted by section 2.  It also wrongly predicts descriptive complements should embed so long as \u2018tasty\u2019 is inside: \u201cHolmes finds the cake to possess tastiness-7 on the scale\u201d is bad.\n\n6.2 Find-as-Belief-about-One\u2019s-Own-Experience  \nMaybe \u2018Holmes finds spinach tasty\u2019 reports his higher-order belief that he experiences tastiness in spinach.  Yet Moorean paradoxes involving experience are benign:\n\n\u2003(14)\u201cSpinach tastes bitter to me, but I don\u2019t believe it does\u2014I trust my doctor who says taste illusions are common.\u201d\n\nThe find paradox (7) is not benign.  Moreover, higher-order belief is epistemically evaluable: one can sensibly ask \u201cIs he right that it tastes sweet to him?\u201d\u2014again clashing with the resistance in section 2.\n\n6.3 Find-as-Judgement-Verb  \n\u2018Judge\u2019 straddles cognition and evaluation; why not treat find as judge with ellipsis?  Because judge participates in fully propositional constructions, licensing that-clauses and embedding under factive verbs.  Find does not:\n\n\u2003(15) a. Holmes judged [that Mary was negligent].  \n\u2003(16)#Holmes found [that Mary was negligent].\n\nThe syntax maps onto semantics: judge is cognitive, find is not.\n\n7. Philosophical Up-shot: Linguistic Undergirding for Expressivism  \nThe five diagnostics converge: find behaves linguistically like an affective verb and unlike any cognitive attitude verb.  That matters for metaethics because the very predicates that license find\u2014tasty, cruel, wrong, admirable\u2014are the ones expressivists treat as conventional expressions of non-cognitive states.  The grammar, independently motivated, lines up exactly with the theory\u2019s psychological commitments.\n\nMore concretely, an expressivist can now answer a longstanding challenge.  Why do assertive moral sentences project a commitment akin to belief if, ex hypothesi, they express desire-like states?  Because the conversational presupposition of assertion is not an invariant requirement to believe one\u2019s words; rather, it is a requirement to be in the canonical attitude toward the content type of one\u2019s words.  For descriptive contents that attitude is belief, for evaluative contents it is the find-state.  Moorean infelicity arises whenever one denies being in the relevant canonical attitude.  The semantics of find thereby supplies the missing pragmatic machinery.\n\nTwo further ramifications deserve mention.\n\nFirst, the expressivist can explain why moral facts are \u201csubjective\u201d without cheap relativism: what is true or false in evaluative discourse is always relativised to the index supplied by a speaker\u2019s affective sensibility, just as what counts as \u2018here\u2019 depends on the speaker\u2019s location.  The relativisation is detectable because find embeds only those adjectives whose interpretation demonstrably shifts with perspective.  \n\nSecond, the empirical line between evaluatives and descriptives becomes linguistically tractable.  Predicates that pattern like tasty under find belong on the expressivist side; those that resist do not.  This yields testable predictions for borderline cases (e.g., \u2018funny\u2019, \u2018boring\u2019, \u2018healthy\u2019).  Indeed, many speakers find \u2018healthy\u2019 marginal under find\u2014supporting the hunch that health talk contains an irreducible descriptive core.\n\nConclusion  \nAffect-laden, non-cognitive, yet world-directed: that is the profile of the mental state find attributes.  The evidence comes from selectional restrictions, resistance to epistemic challenge, Moorean patterns, degree-adverb compatibility, and motivational implicatures.  Each diagnostic, taken alone, might be explained away; taken together they converge on the affective reading.  Linguistic form thus gives the expressivist exactly what she needs: an independently motivated mental category whose outer linguistic shell is visible in everyday English.  Far from being a philosopher\u2019s invention, the divide between belief and evaluative feeling is written into the grammar of the language itself.", "output_tokens": 3146, "reasoning_tokens": 768}

Orientation and Thesis\n\nEnglish offers two routes for saying favourable things about eggplant: the \u201cobjective\u201d route\u2014\u201cEggplant is tasty\u201d\u2014and the \u201csubjective-attitude\u201d route\u2014\u201cI find eggplant tasty.\u201d  A na\u00efve gloss treats the second as a mere report that one believes the first; the difference looks like modest hedging.  I shall argue that this gloss is wrong.  The mental state ascribed by the find-construction is not a cognitive belief at all but a non-cognitive, affect-laden attitude of the same type as liking, loving, detesting, and appreciating.  Five mutually reinforcing kinds of evidence support that claim:\n\nA. Selectional restrictions: \u201cfind\u201d productively selects evaluative predicates but systematically rejects descriptive predicates in a way characteristic of affective verbs and unlike belief-ascribing verbs.\n\nB. Modification diagnostics: epistemic and evidential adverbs that freely modify belief reports (\u201cprobably,\u201d \u201con good evidence,\u201d \u201cobjectively speaking\u201d) are infelicitous with find-constructions, whereas affect-modifiers (\u201cdeeply,\u201d \u201cirrationally\u201d) fit naturally.\n\nC. Inference and disagreement profiles: find-reports license patterns\u2014faultless disagreement, first-person authority, and immunity to counter-evidence\u2014that parallel canonical affective attitudes but diverge sharply from belief.\n\nD. Interaction with Moorean conjunctions: the distinctive infelicity of \u201cIt is wrong to eat meat but I don\u2019t find it wrong\u201d is best explained if the two clauses express conflicting attitudes rather than a belief plus its denial.\n\nE. Independent psychological data: neuro-imaging, developmental studies, and affect-theory show that evaluations of the tasty/beautiful/cruel type are grounded in affective circuits; linguistic constructions that track those evaluations inherit the same psychological profile.\n\nIf these points are correct, the find-construction gives the expressivist an elegant linguistic foothold: English grammar itself treats core evaluative discourse as the articulation of non-cognitive affect.  What follows unpacks each strand of evidence, replies to the leading objections, and sketches the broader philosophical pay-off.\n\n2. What Makes an Attitude Non-Cognitive?\n\n\u201cNon-cognitive,\u201d as I will use it, marks two contrasts with belief.\n\nDirection of fit.  Belief aims at accuracy: if the world is other than the content of my belief, my belief should change.  Affect aims at satisfaction or avoidance: if I love jazz and the world contains too little of it, I campaign for more jazz rather than revising my love.\n\nEpistemic embedding.  Beliefs integrate with reasons that are broadly truth-tracking; affects do not.  One can coherently say \u201cI believe it is raining, but I might be wrong\u201d but not \u201cI detest coriander, but I might be wrong.\u201d  (One can of course hope to lose a distaste, yet that is a change of attitude rather than the correction of an error.)\n\nWe therefore test the cognitive status of an attitude by asking: (i) does it have mind-to-world direction of fit? (ii) can it accept truth-evaluating modifiers like \u201cprobably,\u201d \u201cevidence shows,\u201d or \u201cis incorrect\u201d?\n\n3. Selectional Restrictions: Diagnostics from the Lexicon\n\nFind-constructions pass a robust linguistic test: with striking regularity they accept exactly those predicates that carry an evaluative dimension and resist purely descriptive ones.\n\n(1) a. Holmes found the soup tasty / the d\u00e9cor depressing / the argument persuasive.\n    b. *Holmes found the soup vegetarian / stainless-steel / five feet long.\n\n(2) a. She finds lying wrong / his gesture offensive / the view sublime.\n    b. *She finds lying frequent / his gesture symmetrical / the view western.\n\nWhere other attitude verbs such as \u201cthink,\u201d \u201cbelieve,\u201d \u201csay,\u201d or \u201csuspect\u201d embed freely with both classes of predicate, \u201cfind\u201d patterns with obviously affective verbs:\n\n(3) a. Holmes likes the soup tasty.* (ungrammatical)\n    b. Holmes likes the soup vegetarian.* (ungrammatical)\n    c. Holmes likes tasty soup.  (fine)\n\nEven if one tries contextual accommodation\u2014say, reading \u201cvegetarian\u201d contrastively\u2014the result feels coerced or jocular: \u201cI find the curry vegetarian\u201d gets interpreted metalinguistically (\u201cI discover that it is vegetarian\u201d), not evaluatively.  Selectional restriction is a classic linguistic signal that the embedding verb semantically requires a particular kind of complement; here the required kind is evaluative, precisely the class whose meaning expressivists locate in affective attitude.\n\n4. Modification Diagnostics: The Adverb Test\n\nBelief reports behave well with epistemic, evidential, and degree adverbials.  Find-reports rebel:\n\n(4) a. Holmes probably believes the butler is guilty.\n    b. *Holmes probably finds the butler cruel.\n\n(5) a. On the basis of the fingerprints, she believes the vault was opened at noon.\n    b. *On the basis of the fingerprints, she finds the vault atrocious.\n\n(6) a. I reluctantly believe the theory is false.\n    b. *I reluctantly find the painting beautiful.\n\nWhat does modify find-reports are adverbs expressing the intensity or quality of feeling:\n\n(7) Holmes passionately finds the aria moving.\n(8) She irrationally finds tax law fascinating.\n\nThese are precisely the adverbs that pair with love/hate/detest, not with belief (\u201c*She passionately believes that 37 is prime\u201d).  The best explanation is that find-constructions are semantically typed as affective evaluations, not epistemic assessments.\n\n5. Inference and Disagreement Profiles\n\n5.1 Faultless disagreement.  Suppose:\n\n(9) Holmes finds cilantro delicious.\n(10) Watson finds cilantro not delicious.\n\nThere is a natural sense that both can be right; the dialogue ends with shoulder-shrugging rather than accusation of error.  The same tolerance attaches to likes and dislikes but not to beliefs about mundane matters:\n\n(11) Holmes believes the safe is unlocked, Watson believes it is not.  At most one is correct.\n\n5.2 First-person authority.  Asking \u201cDo you really find it tasty or are you mistaken?\u201d is odd.  One can, by contrast, challenge a belief: \u201cDo you really believe the vault was opened at noon or are you mistaken?\u201d  The immunity to error-through-misidentification is characteristic of affective self-ascription (compare \u201cI\u2019m in pain\u201d): the subject is the final court of appeal.\n\n5.3 Immunity to counter-evidence.  New evidence dissolves belief disagreement, not evaluative disagreement.  A Michelin-starred chef demonstrating umami chemistry might convince Holmes that coriander is objectively suited to the dish, yet Holmes can coherently persist in \u201cStill, I don\u2019t find it tasty.\u201d  The attitude resists the rational pull of evidential reasons.\n\nAll three features match the phenomenology of love, hate, and admiration; none matches the behaviour of belief.  Again, a non-cognitive reading of find-states makes best sense of the contrast.\n\n6. The Moorean Test and Expressivist Support\n\nConsider:\n\n(12) #It is wrong to eat meat, but I don\u2019t find it wrong.\n(13) #Eggplant is tasty, but I don\u2019t find it tasty.\n\nSpeakers experience a pang of pragmatic oddity: something like Moore\u2019s paradox (\u201cIt\u2019s raining but I don\u2019t believe it\u201d) but affect-flavoured.  On an expressivist treatment, the first clause expresses a condemnatory attitude, while the second simultaneously disowns that very attitude.  Conflict at the level of feeling explains the infelicity directly.  The cognitive reading, by contrast, must say that the second clause denies having a certain belief.  Yet the oddity survives even if the speaker explicitly affirms belief while denying finding: \u201cI believe it\u2019s wrong to eat meat, but I don\u2019t find it wrong\u201d is still puzzling.  What is incoherent is the coexistence of condemnation and affective neutrality\u2014exactly what we predict if \u201cfind wrong\u201d names the underlying condemnatory attitude.\n\n7. Objections and Replies\n\nObjection 1: Ordinary speakers treat \u201cI find x tasty\u201d as evidence that x is tasty; hence the state is just a kind of belief whose content is relativised to the subject (\u201cx is tasty-for-me\u201d).\n\nReply.  Even if testimony functions evidentially, the semantics need not be cognitive.  Compare \u201cI enjoy jazz.\u201d  Others may take that as defeasible evidence you will like tonight\u2019s concert, yet \u201cenjoy\u201d is not thereby a belief.  Moreover, relativised-belief analyses cannot capture the adverb and selection facts (#\u201cprobably tasty-for-me\u201d) or faultless disagreement without postulating baroque hidden parameters.  The simpler hypothesis keeps the attitude affective.\n\nObjection 2: Some predicative complements that pass with \u201cfind\u201d look descriptive: \u201cI find the room empty,\u201d \u201cShe found the solution simple.\u201d\n\nReply.  Two responses.  First, \u201cempty\u201d and \u201csimple\u201d straddle the evaluative/descriptive divide; being empty is often evaluated positively (good\u2014we need space) or negatively (bad\u2014no audience).  Second, corpus studies show the evaluative sense dominates in find-constructions, whereas purely descriptive senses appear with a discovery reading (\u201cWe found the vault empty\u201d \u2248 we discovered it was empty), not the subjective reading at issue.\n\nObjection 3: If find-states are non-cognitive affect, why can they embed under propositional-attitude verbs?  One can believe that one finds something tasty.\n\nReply.  Nothing bars higher-order beliefs about lower-order affects.  I can believe that I detest coriander.  Saying so does not convert detestation into belief.\n\n8. Independent Psychological Evidence\n\nLinguistic diagnostics dovetail with empirical psychology:\n\n\u2022 Neuro-imaging.  Judging beauty or moral wrongness recruits orbitofrontal and limbic structures associated with reward and affect rather than regions specialised for factual reasoning (Greene & Haidt, 2002; Kawabata & Zeki, 2004).\n\n\u2022 Developmental trajectories.  Children manifest \u201cyummy/yucky\u201d judgments and \u201cthat\u2019s mean!\u201d long before they grasp representational truth-conditions; their evaluative vocabulary is acquired through caretakers\u2019 approval/disapproval cues, not through evidence-based calibration.\n\n\u2022 Affective priming.  Subliminally presented affective stimuli modulate subsequent \u201cfind X tasty/beautiful\u201d judgments but leave ordinary factual beliefs unchanged, suggesting that evaluative judgments draw on the affect system.\n\nWe should be cautious in reading linguistic categories off brain maps, yet the convergence is striking: the very predicates that English allows under \u201cfind\u201d are those whose evaluation neuroscientists locate in affective circuitry.\n\n9. Synthesis: Why the Linguistic Evidence Matters for Expressivism\n\nExpressivists claim that moral and aesthetic language functions to vent, register, or negotiate affective stances rather than to describe evaluative facts.  Critics object that this is a philosopher\u2019s invention disconnected from natural language.  The behaviour of the find-construction rebuts that objection: English grammar natively distinguishes between representing a property (belief) and expressing a stance (find).  When speakers shift from \u201cEggplant is tasty\u201d to \u201cI find eggplant tasty\u201d they do not merely hedge\u2014they cross a grammatical boundary from cognition to affect.  The Moorean infelicity of pairing an evaluative assertion with a denial of the corresponding find-state confirms that the simple assertion already carries a commitment to the attitude.  Expressivists can therefore explain why \u201cCruelty is wrong but I don\u2019t find it wrong\u201d is self-undermining: the second clause retracts the very condemnation the first expresses.\n\n10. Further Implications and Avenues\n\nDistinguishing belief from find-attitudes illuminates several puzzles:\n\n\u2022 Motivational internalism.  If evaluative judgment just is the adoption of a find-attitude, the link to motivation is analytic: to find harming animals wrong is ipso facto to feel aversion, explaining why amoralists sound paradoxical.\n\n\u2022 Relativism vs. contextualism.  The subjective\u2010attitude view predicts faultless disagreement without committing to truth-relativism about propositions; the disagreement concerns clashing attitudes, not competing truth-claims.\n\n\u2022 Moral testimony.  Taking advice about what is wrong feels alien because I cannot acquire the relevant find-attitude by deference alone; affective uptake is required.\n\nFinally, the find-construction offers a fertile site for cross-linguistic work.  Many languages lack a direct equivalent yet display parallel phenomena through evidential particles or experiential aspect.  Mapping those patterns could expose universal markers of affect in grammar.\n\n11. Conclusion\n\nA battery of linguistic diagnostics\u2014selectional restriction, adverbial modification, inference patterns, Moorean paradox, and disagreement behaviour\u2014converges on a unified picture: \u201cto find x adj\u201d ascribes a non-cognitive, affect-laden attitude, not a belief.  Independent psychological evidence strengthens the verdict.  Because \u201cfind\u201d selectively embeds exactly the predicates at the heart of moral and aesthetic discourse, its semantics provides natural-language corroboration for expressivism.  The grammar of English, it turns out, is already half-way to meta-ethics: when it lets us say \u201cI find it wrong,\u201d it shelters the insight that valuing differs in kind from believing.", "output_tokens": 3630, "reasoning_tokens": 768}

Introduction and Thesis  \n\nExpressivists hold that normative and evaluative language functions primarily to express non-cognitive, affect-like states rather than to describe worldly facts.  A long-standing worry about the view is that, whatever may be true in the armchair, ordinary linguistic data seem to treat \u201cIt\u2019s wrong to X\u201d exactly on a par with \u201cIt rained yesterday\u201d: both embed under tense, negation, and propositional\u2010attitude verbs such as \u2018believe\u2019 and \u2018know\u2019.  If the grammar treats the two classes alike, why shouldn\u2019t the semantics?  The strongest kind of evidence an expressivist could hope for, therefore, is a construction that (i) freely embeds descriptive material, (ii) refuses to embed normative material, or vice-versa.  The English verb \u2018find\u2019 (in its \u201csubjective\u2010attitude\u201d sense, as in \u201cHolmes finds Saltimbocca tasty\u201d) looks tailor-made: it combines happily with evaluative predicates (tasty, rude, cruel, brilliant, wrong, beautiful) but sounds marked or deviant with ordinary descriptive predicates (*vegetarian, *made of pasta, *carbon-neutral).  Moreover, first\u2010person present-tense uses of \u2018find\u2019 pattern with paradigmatic expressions of affect in licensing Moorean infelicity:  \n\n\t??It\u2019s morally wrong to eat meat, but I don\u2019t find it wrong.  \n\nSo much is familiar in the recent semantics literature.  What has not been appreciated\u2014yet is crucial if the expressivist is to win the larger philosophical debate\u2014is that the mental state \u2018find\u2019 attributes is itself non-cognitive.  I will argue that the best explanation of the verb\u2019s syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic profile is that \u2018find\u2019 picks out a family of affective attitudes: roughly, the state one is in when something strikes one as tasty, cruel, or beautiful.  In short:  \n\n\tThesis.  \u2018Find\u2019 (in its subjective-attitude sense) attributes an affective, non-doxastic mental state\u2014belonging to the same category as loving, hating, enjoying, and detesting\u2014and this fact explains its selectional restrictions, its immunity to certain epistemic challenges, its motivational profile, the pattern of Moorean infelicity it generates, and its morpho-syntactic parallels across languages.  \n\nI develop the case in six steps, addressing potential objections along the way.\n\n2. Distributional Evidence: Selectional Restrictions as a Diagnostic of Attitude Type  \n\nThe most elementary clue comes from what kinds of complements \u2018find\u2019 permits.  Compare:  \n\n\ta.  Holmes found the key under the mat.            (discover\u2010sense)  \n\tb.  Holmes finds Saltimbocca tasty.                 (subjective)  \n\tc. *Holmes finds Saltimbocca vegetarian.  \n\td.  Holmes finds lying wrong / her plan brilliant.  \n\te. *Holmes finds lying frequent / the table square.  \n\nThe markedness of (c) and (e) cannot be explained by mere semantics of the adjectives, because the same strings are impeccable under \u2018believe\u2019:  \n\n\tHe believes Saltimbocca is vegetarian;  \n\tHe believes the table is square.  \n\nNor is the restriction reducible to gradability, animacy, or evaluative polarity.  What unifies the acceptable complements is a certain kind of experiential value: adjectives of taste and value, psychological impact (\u2018annoying\u2019, \u2018fascinating\u2019), aesthetic impression (\u2018elegant\u2019, \u2018ugly\u2019), and moral or practical appraisal (\u2018wrong\u2019, \u2018permissible\u2019, \u2018courageous\u2019).  Levinson (2007) labels the superclass \u201cpredicates of personal taste,\u201d but the intuitive category is broader: it includes predicates whose correct application constitutively depends on being subjectively appreciated.  \n\nSuch selectivity has precedents.  Verbs of emotion (\u2018love\u2019, \u2018fear\u2019, \u2018enjoy\u2019) embed propositions only through gerundive or \u2018that\u2019-clauses describing the relevant situation (\u201cShe loves skiing,\u201d \u201cShe dreads that she might fail\u201d), and they, too, resist purely descriptive adjectives (*\u201cShe loves the table square\u201d).  The simplest hypothesis is that \u2018find\u2019 takes the same type of mental object as \u2018like\u2019 or \u2018enjoy\u2019: an affective appraisal.  In contrast, clearly cognitive attitude verbs\u2014\u2018believe\u2019, \u2018think\u2019, \u2018suspect\u2019, \u2018know\u2019\u2014place no such filter on their complements.\n\n3. Phenomenology and Immunity to Error through Misidentification  \n\nIntrospective access provides a second clue.  Suppose I say:  \n\n\t(1) I believe that Osaka is west of Tokyo.  \n\t(2) I find natto disgusting.  \n\nA competent interlocutor can challenge (1) with familiar epistemic tools (\u201cHave you checked a map?\u201d).  But challenges to (2) are of a markedly different kind.  One cannot intelligibly reply, \u201cAre you sure?  Maybe you misperceived your attitude.\u201d  At most one can question whether natto is, in fact, disgusting; but that is to dispute the value, not the speaker\u2019s attitude.  Self-ascriptions of disgust, amusement, or moral disapproval enjoy what Shoemaker called \u201cimmunity to error through misidentification\u201d: if the subject sincerely avows the attitude in the present tense, epistemic space for error is minimal.  \u2018Find\u2019 inherits precisely that pattern.  Contrast:  \n\n\t\u2013 A:  \u201cI find Jones\u2019s joke offensive.\u201d  \n\t\u2013 B:  \u201cNo you don\u2019t\u2014check your evidence\u201d (bizarre).  \n\nInstead, B may reply, \u201cCome on, it\u2019s not offensive,\u201d disputing the evaluative property, not the self-ascribed state.  The asymmetry is telling: states with phenomenology and characteristic valence display this epistemic first-person privilege; propositional beliefs do not.  That \u2018find\u2019 statements are privileged in this way hints that the underlying state is affective, not doxastic.\n\n4. Motivational and Dynamic Consequences  \n\nBeliefs are, by themselves, motivationally inert; they combine with desires to explain action.  Affective appraisals typically have built-in motivational force.  Disgust propels avoidance; approval encourages pursuit; perceiving an act as wrong presses toward censure.  Empirically, \u2018find\u2019-ascriptions predict motivational dispositions in just this way.  If Lena finds clubbing baby seals cruel, we expect her to shun or condemn seal-clubbing; if she merely believes that others call it cruel, or even that it is cruel according to the dictionary, no motivational prediction follows.  Native-speaker judgments back this up:  \n\n\t(3)  #Lena finds clubbing baby seals cruel but is perfectly okay with it.  \n\t(4)  Lena believes clubbing baby seals is cruel but is perfectly okay with it.  \n\n(3) strikes most speakers as contradictory or at least deeply puzzling; (4) is coherent.  Predicate-attitude mismatches of this sort are a trademark of affective, valenced states.  The link to action is looser than the \u201cinternalism\u201d of moral psychology but stronger than the inertness of belief\u2014a perfect fit for non-cognitive attitudes.\n\n5. Moorean Infelicity and the Best Explanation  \n\nThe Moorean pattern noted in the prompt resembles, but is distinct from, standard belief-based paradoxes.  Compare:  \n\n\t(5)  #Meat-eating is wrong, but I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s wrong.  \n\t(6)  #Meat-eating is wrong, but I don\u2019t find it wrong.  \n\t(7)  It\u2019s raining, but I don\u2019t believe it is.  \n\n(5) and (7) are versions of traditional Moore\u2019s paradox: an outright contradiction in pragmatic commitments.  In (6) the tension is subtler, because \u2018find\u2019-states carry no obvious descriptive commitment about what is wrong.  Nevertheless, the sentence is defective in a recognizably affective way\u2014akin to \u201cIt\u2019s delightful, but I am not delighted by it.\u201d  The best explanation is that asserting an evaluative claim pragmatically presupposes that the speaker is in the corresponding affective state.  That presupposition is linguistic only if the mental state is affective in kind; a pure belief about what is tasteful would not incur the same conflict.  On any account, the simplest way to model (6)\u2019s infelicity is to treat \u2018find\u2019-states and their corresponding unembedded evaluative statements as expressing the same family of non-cognitive attitudes.  Thus the pattern supplies indirect evidence for the affective reading of \u2018find\u2019.\n\n6. Morphosyntactic Parallels with Canonical Emotion Verbs  \n\nA less discussed but revealing fact: cross-linguistically, verbs equivalent to subjective \u2018find\u2019 pattern morphosyntactically with emotion verbs, not with belief verbs.  French \u2018trouver\u2019, Spanish \u2018encontrar\u2019, German \u2018finden\u2019, Greek \u2018vrisko\u2019 all allow the evaluative-predicate construction and commonly take the experiencer in dative or oblique case, just like \u2018annoyer\u2019, \u2018gustar\u2019, \u2018entristecer\u2019.  In Spanish:  \n\n\t(8)  Me  parece / *me  creo   delicioso.  \n\t    to-me seems    / to-me believe delicious  \n\t    \u201cIt strikes me as / *I believe it to be delicious.\u201d  \n\n\u2018Parece\u2019 (\u201cseems\u201d) is perception-like; \u2018creo\u2019 (\u201cbelieve\u201d) is belief-like and ungrammatical in the evaluative complement construction.  \u2018Encontrar\u2019 patterns with \u2018parecer\u2019, not with \u2018creer\u2019.  The cross-linguistic clustering is unlikely to be accidental.  Grammatical diachrony treats \u2018find\u2019 as an experiential predicate on the model of sense perception verbs (\u201cX looks red to me\u201d), which converge typologically with psychological or emotive predicates.\n\n7. Objections and Replies  \n\nObjection 1:  \u2018Find\u2019 merely ascribes the second-order belief that one has a certain first-order belief (\u201cI believe myself to believe that X is cruel\u201d).  Then the state would remain cognitive.  \n\nReply:  The introspective immunity and motivational force documented above do not accompany de se beliefs about beliefs.  A scientist can believe she believes that p and discover evidence of self-deception; no analogous discovery is available for sincere \u2018find\u2019-attitudes.  Moreover, second-order beliefs lack valence; yet \u2018find\u2019-states are evidently valenced (one can find something delightful or appalling).  So the cognitive proposal confuses the report of an attitude with the attitude itself.\n\nObjection 2:  Some \u2018find\u2019-complements are not obviously evaluative (\u201cI find the room empty\u201d).  Doesn\u2019t that undermine the selectional story?  \n\nReply:  There are two homophonous verbs, call them FIND\u00b9 (discovery) and FIND\u00b2 (subjective appraisal).  FIND\u00b9 takes nominal complements (\u201cfind the key\u201d) or \u2018that\u2019-clauses (\u201cI find that the room is empty\u201d) and has no selectional restriction.  FIND\u00b2 takes either \u2018Adj\u2019 or \u2018it Adj/NP\u2019 complements (\u201cfind it odd,\u201d \u201cfind him obnoxious\u201d).  The argument here targets FIND\u00b2 only, and the diagnostics I have given\u2014selectional restriction, Moorean pattern, motivational effects\u2014apply exclusively to that sense.  The apparent counterexamples are of the discovery type.\n\nObjection 3:  If \u2018find\u2019-states are non-cognitive affects, why are they linguistically realized as propositional-attitude constructions at all?  Why not use the canonical affect lexicon (\u2018love\u2019, \u2018hate\u2019, \u2018fear\u2019)?  \n\nReply:  Nothing in the view forbids affect from having propositional content.  What matters is whether the mental mode toward that content is belief-like or affect-like.  \u2018Hope\u2019, \u2018fear\u2019, and \u2018treasure\u2019 all embed propositions; their mental mode is affective (desiderative, anxious, valuational).  \u2018Find\u2019 shares that architecture: a propositionally articulated stimulus (lying, disrespect, modernist architecture) toward which the subject has an evaluative stance.  The lexical morphology encodes the same bifurcation that linguists posit for \u2018hope\u2019 (desire\u2010like) versus \u2018believe\u2019 (thought\u2010like).\n\n8. Convergence of Evidence and Theoretical Payoff  \n\nThe six strands of evidence\u2014selectional restriction, epistemic first-person authority, motivational profile, Moorean infelicity, cross-linguistic morphology, and failure of competing accounts\u2014converge on a single diagnosis: the state reported by subjective \u2018find\u2019 is an affective appraisal.  This conclusion lends independent support to expressivism.  For if \u2018S finds lying wrong\u2019 attributes a non-cognitive state and if \u201cLying is wrong\u201d pragmatically presupposes\u2014or even semantically encodes\u2014the same state, then the linguistic data harmonize with the expressivist claim that afirmatives like \u201cLying is wrong\u201d function primarily to express affective attitudes.\n\n9. Broader Implications  \n\nFirst, the data illuminate why evaluative predicates pattern differently in other syntactic environments as well (e.g., taste adjectives behave anomalously under epistemic modals).  A unified account in terms of affective content becomes attractive.  Second, the findings help reconcile two apparently conflicting intuitions: objectivists say evaluative claims are truth-apt; expressivists say they express attitudes.  The \u2018find\u2019 construction shows that natural language can maintain both dimensions: the embedded adjective supplies a truth-aptness conditional on a perspective, while the embedding verb encodes the non-cognitive stance.  Third, the analysis predicts and explains cross-speaker \u201cfaultless disagreement\u201d: if \u2018find\u2019 picks out genuinely subjective affect, two speakers can coherently disagree about whether natto is tasty without anybody describing a communal fact incorrectly.\n\n10. Conclusion  \n\nThe subjective-attitude sense of \u2018find\u2019 is not a quirky idiom but a grammatical window into the psychology of evaluation.  Its syntactic selectivity, pragmatic effects, and cross-linguistic behavior are best explained on the hypothesis that \u2018find\u2019 ascribes an affective, non-doxastic state: a felt appraisal akin to liking or disliking.  Once that is on the table, the expressivist can claim an ally in the grammar of English (and kindred tongues), for the Moorean infelicity of evaluative assertions with concomitant denials of \u2018find\u2019 follows naturally if both clauses traffic in the same affective mode.  Linguistic evidence, then, does not merely coexist with expressivism; it actively recommends it by displaying a construction whose logic mirrors the heart of the expressivist program.", "output_tokens": 4425, "reasoning_tokens": 1280}

Setting the Stage  \n\nOrdinary English contains (at least) two homophonous verbs spelled \u201cfind.\u201d  One is the familiar factive discovery verb as in \u201cI found that the pipe was broken,\u201d on a par with \u201cdiscover\u201d or \u201clearn.\u201d  The other\u2014our target here\u2014is the subjective-attitude verb that takes a bare small-clause complement and requires an evaluative predicate:  \n\n\u2003(a) Sherlock finds Saltimbocca tasty.  \n\u2003(b) *Sherlock finds Saltimbocca vegetarian.  \n\nCall this second item find\u2082.  The question is whether the mental state find\u2082 attributes is cognitive (a belief-like state whose content purports to represent the world) or non-cognitive/affective (a pro-attitude, taste, or feeling).  Expressivists about value are keen to show that it is the latter, since then the linguistic behavior of \u201cwrong,\u201d \u201ctasty,\u201d \u201cbeautiful,\u201d etc. would line up neatly with a recognizably affect-reporting construction.  I shall argue that the evidence\u2014from syntax and selectional restrictions through phenomenology, motivational profile, truth-value tests, Moorean infelicity, disagreement data, and cross-linguistic parallels\u2014converges on the conclusion that the attitude encoded by find\u2082 is indeed non-cognitive and specifically affective, belonging to the psychological family that includes liking, loving, admiring, hating, detesting, marvelling, and the like.  That conclusion not only bolsters expressivism but also helps explain several otherwise puzzling linguistic facts.\n\n2. Selectional Restrictions: the First Diagnostic  \n\nThe most obvious clue is purely distributional.  Find\u2082 is happy with adjectives that encode value or aesthetic assessment:\n\n\u2003Holmes finds the sonata exquisite / the joke offensive / the plan ingenious.  \n\nIt flatly rejects adjectives that encode descriptive, chemical, or historical properties:\n\n\u2003*Holmes finds the chair wooden / the molecule chiral / the treaty bilateral.  \n\nSelectional restrictions are rarely accidental in the lexicon; they normally reflect the type of mental complement the verb takes.  Compare \u201cwant\u201d and \u201cfear,\u201d which both embed infinitival clauses denoting goals or possibilities rather than bare facts, because wanting and fearing are motivational and emotional rather than evidential attitudes.  That find\u2082 tolerates only evaluative small clauses strongly suggests that its complement is not a proposition with a truth-condition but a value trope toward which the subject stands in a favorable or unfavorable affective relation.  (The unacceptability of *\u201cfind vegetarian\u201d cannot plausibly be blamed on weirdness or pragmatic presupposition, because \u201cbelieve vegetarian\u201d and \u201cdiscover vegetarian\u201d are perfectly fine.)\n\n3. Morphological Evidence: Small Clauses vs. \u201cThat\u201d-Clauses  \n\nBelief reporting verbs happily take finite \u201cthat\u201d-clauses:\n\n\u2003Watson believes that Moriarty is in Europe.  \n\nFind\u2082 categorically refuses:\n\n\u2003*Watson finds that Moriarty is cruel.  \n\nCrucially, \u201ccruel\u201d is good when supplied in a bare small clause: \u201cWatson finds Moriarty cruel.\u201d  That syntactic difference tracks the difference between propositional complements (full clauses) and predicational/evaluative complements (small clauses without tense or modality).  If the relevant mental state were an ordinary belief, there would be no reason for the stark ban on \u201cthat.\u201d  Simpler explanation: find\u2082 does not take a proposition at all; rather, it takes a property and reports that the subject\u2019s conative or affective system reacts to that property-token in a positive or negative way.  (A parallel: \u201cconsider\u201d in \u201cI consider her talented\u201d also bans \u201cthat,\u201d and \u201cconsider\u201d is widely treated in formal semantics as a \u201ctasty\u201d-type attitude that relates an individual to a predicate rather than to a proposition.)\n\n4. Truth-Value Tests and Faultless Disagreement  \n\nBecause the complement of find\u2082 is not itself asserted, sentences of the form \u201cA finds x \u03a6 but x is not \u03a6\u201d are perfectly coherent:\n\n\u2003I find coriander tasty but I know it isn\u2019t tasty to my partner.  \n\nOne cannot similarly coherently say:\n\n\u2003*I believe coriander is tasty but coriander isn\u2019t tasty.  \n\nBelief reports entail a commitment to the truth of the embedded proposition (because to believe p is precisely to take p to be true).  Find\u2082 reports do not: they commit only to an internal reaction, leaving worldly predication explicitly an open matter.  Such asymmetry is predicted if the attitude is affective rather than representational: having a sweet-tooth feeling is not a judgment that the object is sweet \u201cin itself.\u201d  Relatedly, \u201cI find x tasty\u201d and \u201cI do not find x tasty\u201d engender what K\u00f6lbel and Lasersohn call \u201cfaultless disagreement\u201d\u2014both can be true of the same context without cognitive error.  That pattern is characteristic of taste and value discourse precisely because it reports perspectival stances rather than objective beliefs.\n\n5. Moorean Tests  \n\nMoorean infelicity famously arises when a speaker combines a commitment with a denial of holding the corresponding commitment-state (\u201cIt\u2019s raining, but I don\u2019t believe it\u201d).  Expressivists point out the striking parallel for evaluatives:\n\n\u2003??Eating meat is wrong, but I don\u2019t find it wrong.  \n\nThe oddity is exactly on a par with the Moorean oddity generated by belief: the first clause performs a commitment of a certain type, while the second disavows having the mental state constitutive of that type.  The only good explanation is that uttering \u201cEating meat is wrong\u201d standardly expresses the very same category of attitude that \u201cfind wrong\u201d attributes\u2014an affective stance.\n\n6. Phenomenological and Affective Markers  \n\nIntrospection is defeasible but not useless.  When I ask myself what it is like to \u201cfind basil delicious,\u201d I do not discover a detached map of the world being updated; rather, I become aware of a valenced sensation, a mild gustatory pleasure, a tug toward continued consumption.  Similarly, to \u201cfind lying wrong\u201d is to experience a negative construal of the prospect, often with associated emotional coloration (disgust, guilt, anger).  These experiences bear the hallmark phenomenology of emotions or conative attitudes (valence, motivational push), not of beliefs (which are typically neutral in phenomenology and motivation).  \n\nThat phenomenology lines up neatly with neuroscientific data: judgments of taste, beauty, and moral appraisal recruit affect-laden circuitry (orbitofrontal cortex, amygdala, ventral striatum) more than the truth-evaluative circuitry activated by factual belief updating (lateral prefrontal, parietal).  While the neuroscience is not decisive, it fits the affective analysis.\n\n7. Motivational Internalism as a Linguistic Diagnostic  \n\nInternalist theses in ethics hold that sincerely judging \u03a6 to be wrong normally motivates some tendency to avoid \u03a6.  A softer linguistic correlate shows up in the contrast between \u201cbelieve wrong\u201d and \u201cfind wrong.\u201d  Consider:  \n\n\u2003a. Jones believes meat-eating is wrong but cheerfully orders steak and feels no unease.  \n\u2003b. ?Jones finds meat-eating wrong but cheerfully orders steak and feels no unease.  \n\nSentence (b) strikes many speakers as either contradictory or as shifting the reading of \u201cfind.\u201d  The non-cognitive attitude attributed by find\u2082 is inherently linked to conative pressure; hence the apparent inconsistency.  No such pressure is built into mere belief ascription, so (a) is fine.  This mapping of grammatical form onto motivational profile is best explained if find\u2082 attributes an evaluatively valenced affect rather than a detached belief.\n\n8. Adverbial Modification and Degree Intensifiers  \n\nPurely cognitive attitudes react poorly to degree modifiers that encode felt intensity; affective attitudes welcome them.  Compare:\n\n\u2003I somewhat / deeply / viscerally find his remark offensive.  \n\u2003?I somewhat / deeply / viscerally believe that snow is white.  \n\nThe naturalness of affective adverbs with find\u2082 again aligns it with the family of \u201clove,\u201d \u201cdetest,\u201d \u201cmarvel at,\u201d all of which take degree-of-feeling adverbs.  Cognitive attitudes such as believing, knowing, and remembering resist such adverbs because their primary dimension is accuracy or justification, not felt intensity.\n\n9. Embedding in Intensional Contexts  \n\nAnother diagnostic: opacity to evidence and revision.  Beliefs update when counter-evidence is encountered; affective stances often do not.  In reported-speech contexts we get:\n\n\u2003Initially, Watson found the violin solos tedious, but after repeated hearings he still found them tedious despite realizing that connoisseurs loved them.  \n\nThe very contrast between \u201crealizing\u201d (a cognition) and \u201cfinding tedious\u201d (affective distaste persisting) underlines that find\u2082 is insulated from mere information.  It behaves like \u201chate\u201d rather than \u201cbelieve.\u201d\n\n10. Cross-linguistic Corroboration  \n\nMany languages use special \u2018taste\u2019 or \u2018experience\u2019 verbs that pattern exactly like find\u2082.  Spanish \u201cparecer\u201d with datives (\u201cA Juan le parece deliciosa la sopa\u201d), German \u201cschmecken\u201d (\u201cMir schmeckt der Kuchen lecker\u201d), Japanese \u201coishii to omou\u201d vs. \u201coishii\u201d with exclamative intonation.  These constructions are subject-oriented, resist neutral descriptive adjectives, and display the same faultless-disagreement and Moorean phenomena.  That convergence across unrelated languages suggests that the grammar of evaluative attitude ascription exploits a universal non-cognitive category.\n\n11. Distinguishing Objection: Could Find\u2082 Report a Belief About Subjective Properties?  \n\nA cognitivist opponent might reply that find\u2082 simply abbreviates \u201cbelieve to have the subjective property tasty-to-me.\u201d  Then the complement is descriptive after all (albeit relativized), and all we have is garden-variety belief ascription.  Two replies:\n\na. Economy and Occam.  A language ordinarily does not create a special syntactic frame and semantic type merely to encode a run-of-the-mill belief.  If find\u2082 were ordinary belief plus a hidden relativization, why ban \u201cthat\u201d-clauses?  Why demand evaluative adjectives?  The multiplying of semantic machinery is gratuitous compared with the affective account.\n\nb. Expressive Content vs. Truth-conditions.  Suppose \u201ctasty-to-me\u201d is shoved into the proposition.  One predicts that \u201cJohn finds the soup tasty\u201d should commit the ascriber to the truth of \u201cThe soup is tasty to John,\u201d so that flat denial yields contradiction.  Yet we can easily say \u201cJohn finds the soup tasty, but it\u2019s not tasty to him; he\u2019s just pretending.\u201d  That sentence is odd only because pretending undermines sincerity, not because of outright contradiction.  The only stable reading is one on which find\u2082 does not attribute a belief about tastiness-to-S but directly attributes the taste reaction itself.  The cognitivist proposal therefore faces a mismatch.\n\n12. Objection from Epistemic Language Inside the Complement  \n\nSome speakers accept: \u201cI find it probably wrong to lie.\u201d  Here a descriptive epistemic modal \u201cprobably\u201d appears inside the small clause, which might look cognitive.  The phenomenon is, however, illusory: the sentence really distributes the attitude over two elements\u2014\u201cI find [it wrong] and it is probably so\u201d\u2014or involves a garden-path.  Speakers who allow it also allow \u201cI find it maybe wrong,\u201d which is telling: \u201cmaybe wrong\u201d itself is borderline evaluative (\u201ciffy\u201d).  The generalization that purely descriptive material is marginal remains intact.\n\n13. The Expressivist Pay-off  \n\nIf the foregoing diagnostics are correct, then the mental state lexically hooked to find\u2082 is an affective attitude.  But ordinary first-personal assertions of the predicates that find\u2082 licenses (\u201ctasty,\u201d \u201cbeautiful,\u201d \u201cwrong,\u201d \u201ccruel,\u201d etc.) are standardly used to express exactly the same stance.  That explains:\n\n\u2003(i) Parallel felicity conditions (what it takes to assert vs. what it takes to ascribe finding).  \n\u2003(ii) The Moorean pattern (asserting and then denying possession of the stance is incoherent).  \n\u2003(iii) Predicate selection (only those expressions whose canonical speech-act is to express an attitude fit under find\u2082).  \n\nHence, linguistic data supply a neat abductive argument for expressivism: the best explanation of the distribution is that evaluating is, at bottom, expressing a non-cognitive affective stance, and find\u2082 is simply the third-person form of that expression.\n\n14. Wider Theoretical Consequences  \n\nRecognizing find\u2082 as a non-cognitive attitude verb sheds light on several long-standing puzzles:\n\n\u2022 The notorious embedding problem for expressivism (Frege-Geach) eases because the grammar already provides a route to embed an affective state in the scope of logical operators: \u201cIf Kim finds lying wrong, she won\u2019t do it.\u201d  The conditional concerns Kim\u2019s attitude, not the wrongness itself.\n\n\u2022 Metaethical disagreement need not invoke error theories; we can analyze \u201cX is wrong\u201d and \u201cX is not wrong\u201d as conflicting tensions of affect, akin to conflicting preferences, while maintaining full sincerity.\n\n\u2022 The alignment of moral, aesthetic, and gustatory vocabularies under a single grammatical umbrella is no coincidence; the same affective category underwrites them.\n\n15. Conclusion  \n\nSyntactic form (small clause only), lexical selection (evaluatives only), semantic properties (no factive entailment, coherence with world-denial), pragmatic syndromes (Moorean infelicity, faultless disagreement), modification patterns (degree adverbs), motivational links, phenomenology, and cross-linguistic evidence all tell in the same direction: the mental state encoded by the subjective-attitude verb find\u2082 is non-cognitive and affective.  It is kin to liking, loving, hating, admiring, detesting, rather than believing, knowing, or remembering.  That empirical conclusion meshes smoothly with expressivist accounts of evaluative language, providing them with precisely the kind of linguistic anchor their critics often claim they lack.  Far from being an exotic philosophical posit, the affective stance surfaces plainly in English grammar, if only we attend carefully to the humble verb \u201cfind.\u201d", "output_tokens": 3682, "reasoning_tokens": 640}

Introduction and Thesis  \n\nWhat kind of mental state is picked out when an English speaker says \u201cHolmes finds Saltimbocca tasty\u201d or \u201cRosa finds lying wrong\u201d?  My thesis is that \u2018find\u2019-constructions attribute a genuinely affective attitude rather than a belief-like cognitive state.  The attitude is (a) valenced, (b) motivationally potent, and (c) insensitive to the ordinary epistemic norms that govern belief.  In short, \u2018finding\u2019 something tasty, beautiful, offensive, cruel, etc. belongs to the same natural category as loving, liking, enjoying, admiring, hating and detesting.  If that is right, the way evaluative predicates embed under \u2018find\u2019 supplies a neat piece of linguistic evidence in favour of expressivist pictures of moral and aesthetic discourse.  I will marshal six mutually reinforcing pieces of evidence:\n\n    1. Selective complementation: only evaluative predicates\u2014and, crucially, no purely descriptive ones\u2014are licensed after \u2018find\u2019.\n    2. Phenomenological report test: speakers treat \u2018find p\u2019 as a statement of how something feels, not how it is.\n    3. Moorean infelicity pattern: conjunctions of an evaluative claim with the denial of a corresponding \u2018find\u2019-attitude sound self-contradictory, mirroring standard Moore-paradoxes for belief.\n    4. Disconnection from epistemic reasons: defeaters that matter for belief leave \u2018find\u2019 attitudes intact; affect and belief can come apart without incoherence.\n    5. Interaction with motivational discourse: practical-reason clauses (\u201cin order to\u201d) and desire reports are felicitous continuations of \u2018find\u2019, unlike with ordinary doxastic verbs.\n    6. Cross-linguistic and diachronic regularities: the same profile turns up for French trouver, German finden, Norwegian synes, Spanish encontrar, and even in historical shifts in English itself\u2014strong evidence that we are tracking a stable semantic type.\n\nThe rest of the essay fills out these six lines of evidence, replies to rival hypotheses (especially the tempting thought that \u2018find\u2019 simply means \u2018judge\u2019 or \u2018believe-on-the-basis-of-experience\u2019), and ends by drawing the moral for meta-ethics.\n\n2. Selective complementation  \n\nBegin with a quick corpus glance.  Evaluative adjectives like \u2018tasty\u2019, \u2018boring\u2019, \u2018touching\u2019, \u2018unfair\u2019, \u2018disgusting\u2019, \u2018beautiful\u2019, \u2018morally abhorrent\u2019 occur thousands of times as complements of \u2018find\u2019.  Try the same search with colour adjectives, shape predicates, biological kinds, or relational nouns:\n\n    (1) *I find the wall red.\n    (2) *Watson finds Moriarty a mammal.\n    (3) *She found the vase broken yesterday.\n\nAll are deviant (set aside the unrelated idiom \u201cfind X ADJ\u201d in the sense of \u2018discover\u2019, as in \u2018found the vase broken\u2019).  Descriptive gradable adjectives like \u2018tall\u2019, \u2018heavy\u2019, \u2018expensive\u2019, which happily embed under \u2018seem\u2019 and \u2018look\u2019, still resist \u2018find\u2019:\n\n    (4) ?? I find the tower tall.\n    (5) OK  The tower looks tall to me.\n\nSo while \u2018seem\u2019 is a broadly \u2018appearance\u2019 verb, \u2018find\u2019 is choosy: it only embeds predicates whose content is already evaluative.  That restriction on complement type suggests that the verb contributes nothing propositional\u2014it merely hooks onto an attitude that is already non-descriptive in content.  Parallel facts hold for French trouver and German finden; in those languages too, \u2018find\u2019 stubbornly rejects descriptive adjectives (*je trouve la tour haute, *ich finde den Turm hoch) while welcoming evaluatives (je trouve ce film ennuyeux, ich finde dieses Gem\u00e4lde sch\u00f6n).\n\nAn epistemic or perception-cum-belief analysis would predict the opposite.  If \u2018Holmes finds p\u2019 just meant \u2018Holmes comes to believe p as a result of encounter\u2019, there is no semantic reason for the adult grammar to block descriptive complements.  Inference: the lexical semantics of \u2018find\u2019 targets an attitude whose natural domain is evaluative, not factual, content.\n\n3. Phenomenological report test  \n\nAsk a speaker to paraphrase \u201cI find coriander soapy\u201d.  Typical answers: \u201cCoriander tastes soapy to me\u201d, \u201cI experience it that way\u201d, \u201cIt hits me wrong\u201d.  Paraphrases that invoke belief are resisted: \u201cI believe coriander is soapy\u201d sounds as if one holds a chemical thesis about the herb.  Conversely, for a clearly descriptive sentence such as \u201cI believe coriander belongs to the Apiaceae\u201d, substituting \u2018find\u2019 is infelicitous:\n\n    (6) I believe coriander belongs to the Apiaceae.      (belief)\n    (7) *I find coriander belongs to the Apiaceae.        (odd)\n\nIntrospective reportability here tracks the canonical difference philosophers draw between belief and affect: belief aims at representing how the world is; affect registers how the world strikes or moves the subject.  Speakers spontaneously locate \u2018finding\u2019 in the second camp.\n\n4. Moorean infelicity pattern  \n\nStandard Moore paradox: \u2018#It\u2019s raining but I don\u2019t believe it is\u2019 generates pragmatic incoherence because belief is the attitude whose sincerity condition is asserting p.  For expressivists, the analog should hold between sincerely uttering an evaluative claim and being in the relevant affective state.  And it does:\n\n    (8) # Stealing is wrong, but I don\u2019t find it wrong.\n    (9) # This soup is delicious, but I don\u2019t find it delicious.\n\nThe deviance is immediate and parallels the original Moore pattern.  By contrast, mixing an evaluative claim with the denial of a corresponding belief is fine:\n\n    (10) Stealing is wrong, though I\u2019m reluctant to believe it.\n    (11) The soup is delicious, although I don\u2019t believe it yet.\n\nExample (11) can be used by a chef who trusts the critics but has a head-cold that dulls his palate; no pragmatic clash ensues.  The contrast shows that the attitude constitutively tied to sincere evaluative assertion is the \u2018find\u2019-state, not belief.  That is exactly what non-cognitivists predict: asserting \u2018wrong\u2019, \u2018tasty\u2019, \u2018cruel\u2019 is primarily an act of expressing affect; incongruously denying the relevant affect yields the Moore effect.\n\n5. Disconnection from epistemic reasons  \n\nBeliefs are answerable to evidence and apt to be withdrawn when undermined.  \u2018Find\u2019 attitudes are notably stubborn in the face of such defeaters.\n\n    (12) I know cilantro is compositionally identical to parsley, but I still find it disgusting.\n    (13) Even after reading three compelling defences of Kantian ethics, I find retributive punishment barbaric.\n\nNo irrationality is perceived; in fact, these statements sound ordinary.  The subject can possess overwhelming descriptive evidence (\u2018cilantro is safe\u2019, \u2018retributivism deters crime\u2019) yet continue to \u2018find\u2019 the relevant practice disgusting or barbaric without criticism for epistemic vice.  What binds \u2018find\u2019 is not evidential warrant, but its own phenomenological or conative conditions.  This is the hallmark of affective attitudes.\n\nCompare belief:\n\n    (14) # I know the ice is one metre thick, but I still believe it is thin.\n\nHere the conjunction feels incoherent, because knowledge is the strongest epistemic defeater for the negated belief.  With \u2018find\u2019, knowledge leaves the attitude untouched.\n\n6. Interaction with motivational discourse  \n\nDesires can be cited as reasons for action with infinitival \u2018to\u2019-clauses.  Beliefs cannot (unless embedded in a bigger structure).  Observe how smoothly \u2018find\u2019-states appear alongside practical explanation:\n\n    (15) I find these negotiations unfair, so I\u2019m pushing for arbitration.\n    (16) She found the performance moving and, to share the experience, immediately bought tickets for her friends.\n\nNo special bridging premise is required.  The explanation flows because \u2018find\u2019 already encodes a motivational element: evaluating something as unfair or moving makes behavioural responses intelligible.  Now try the same with \u2018believe\u2019:\n\n    (17) ?? She believes the performance lasted ninety minutes, so she bought tickets for her friends.\n\nAn additional desire premise is needed (\u2018\u2026and she wants them to see a ninety-minute show\u2019).  Again the data line up: \u2018find\u2019 is closer to desire/affect than to belief in the functional role it supports.\n\n7. Cross-linguistic and diachronic evidence  \n\nIf the above phenomena were an English idiosyncrasy, appeal to them in support of expressivism would be feeble.  They are not.  Two robust cross-linguistic patterns emerge from typological surveys (Anand & Korotkova 2018; S\u00e6b\u00f8 2015):\n\n    a. Special attitude verb.  Many languages have a verb whose literal meaning is \u2018find\u2019 or \u2018seem-to-me\u2019, whose complementation is limited to evaluatives.  Examples: French trouver, German finden, Norwegian synes, Spanish encontrar, Russian nahodit\u2019.\n    b. Stability under semantic change.  In Middle English, \u2018think\u2019 (\u00feencan) had a \u2018find-like\u2019 use now lost; when that sense drifted, modern \u2018find\u2019 stepped in.  The gap for an affective-evaluative attitude verb appears to be recurrently filled.\n\nThe typological convergence is hard to explain unless we posit a cognitively real attitude\u2014and hence a lexical niche\u2014for affective evaluation.  Nothing in the mere mechanics of perceptual belief formation would predict such convergence.\n\n8. Replies to alternative analyses  \n\n(1) \u2018Find\u2019 = \u2018judge on the basis of perception\u2019.  \nObjection: why the complement restriction?  One can perceptually judge that a wall is red.  Yet \u2018find red\u2019 is ungrammatical.  Moreover, perception-based judgement is still answerable to counter-evidence (\u201clighting is deceptive\u201d), but as we saw, \u2018find\u2019 states are not.\n\n(2) \u2018Find\u2019 = \u2018believe reluctantly / tentatively\u2019.  \nCounter-evidence: adverbials that pick out tentative beliefs (\u2018apparently\u2019, \u2018so they say\u2019) do not mesh well with \u2018find\u2019:\n\n    (18) *I apparently find the soup tasty.\n\nWhereas they are perfect with \u2018believe\u2019:\n\n    (19) I apparently believe the soup contains truffle.\n\n(3) \u2018Find\u2019 = \u2018have the impression that\u2019.  \nImpressions can be purely descriptive and corrigible; again, the complement restriction and resistance to correction disconfirm the hypothesis.\n\n(4) \u2018Find\u2019 expresses both affect and belief.  \nThen Moore facts with \u2018belief\u2019 should replicate, but they do not (see 10\u201311).  The dual-attitude theory also predicts that when belief and affect come apart, \u2018find\u2019 constructions should be degraded.  They are not; we noted (12\u201313).\n\n9. Beyond competence: a structural proposal  \n\nWhy does the grammar pair \u2018find\u2019 with evaluative predicates?  Here is a speculative but explanatory conjecture.  Evaluate-with-\u2018find\u2019 sentences receive, at the level of semantic type, an extra subject-indexed parameter: a value for affective stance.  Call this parameter \u03c3s (for \u2018sentiment\u2019).  Plain descriptive predicates denote functions from worlds to truth-values, p: w \u2192 {0,1}.  Evaluative predicates denote functions from ordered pairs \u27e8w,\u03c3\u27e9 to {0,1}.  The \u2018find\u2019 operator existentially closes off the world argument (hence immunity to evidence) and makes the attitude\u2019s satisfaction wholly depend on \u03c3.  Formally:\n\n    \u27e6find\u27e7(x)(\u03d5) is true at world w, sentiment state \u03c3 of x, iff \u03d5(\u03c3,x) = 1.\n\nOn this model, the complement restriction ceases to be mysterious: descriptive predicates lack a slot for \u03c3, so composition fails.  The semantics also explains motivational potency (\u03c3 contains valence), the Moore pattern (assertion of \u03d5 is canonical expression of \u03c3), and the epistemic insulation (world-parameter is off-loaded).  A nice by-product: we can now say why perceptual appearance verbs like \u2018look\u2019 are compatible with descriptive adjectives\u2014they operate on a different two-place function \u27e8w, viewpoint\u27e9.\n\n10. Consequences for expressivism  \n\nIf the foregoing is correct, ordinary language already encodes, in its core grammar, a distinction between belief-reporting verbs (\u2018think\u2019, \u2018believe\u2019, \u2018be certain that\u2019) and affect-reporting verbs (\u2018find\u2019, \u2018feel that\u2019, \u2018consider + Adj\u2019 in some dialects).  Evaluative predicates are lexically aligned with the second class.  That alignment vindicates a central linguistic datum cited by expressivists: the best explanation of why we naturally express moral and aesthetic claims in terms of how we \u2018find\u2019 them is that evaluation is a kind of affective stance, not a descriptive representation of the world.  Of course, the argument is defeasible; error-theorists could hold that the grammar mis-classifies evaluative practice.  Still, without positing a non-cognitive layer, the patterns surveyed above look puzzling.\n\n11. Conclusion  \n\nLinguistic evidence, phenomenology, pragmatic tests, motivational linkages and cross-linguistic regularities converge on a single verdict: \u2018find\u2019-constructions attribute a non-cognitive, affective attitude.  This attitude is not a low-octane belief nor a perception-based judgement but a valenced stance akin to liking, admiring and detesting.  Because evaluative predicates\u2014moral, aesthetic, gustatory\u2014are precisely the ones that co-occur with \u2018find\u2019, the data provide an elegant piece of support for expressivist meta-ethics: the grammar of natural language itself treats evaluative discourse as the articulation of affect.  Far from being a philosopher\u2019s invention, the belief/attitude distinction is thus grammatically entrenched.  Anyone hoping to defend full-blooded cognitivism about value must explain why our best guide to the mind in language\u2014the verbs we use to ascribe mental states\u2014lines up solidly on the non-cognitive side.", "output_tokens": 3611, "reasoning_tokens": 576}

Orientation  \n\nMeta-ethical expressivists hold that moral and other evaluative utterances function less like the assertion of ordinary facts and more like the voicing of conative or affective attitudes.  A promising way to test that claim is to look at the verbs that canonically embed evaluative material.  In current English, the clearest such verb is the so-called \u201csubjective attitude verb\u201d find in its \u201csmall-clause\u201d construction:\n\n  (1)  Holmes finds opium smoking wrong.  \n  (2)  Mary finds Chinese broccoli tasty.\n\nPeculiarly, (1\u20132) are impeccable while the parallel sentences with descriptives crash:\n\n  (3) *Holmes finds opium smoking widespread.  \n  (4) *Mary finds Chinese broccoli cruciferous.\n\nA natural hypothesis is that the state find ascribes is itself not a belief (doxastic, cognitive) but an affective attitude of roughly the same family as loving, liking, disliking, esteeming, detesting, admiring, etc.  If that is right, then the Moore-paradoxical character of \u201cIt is wrong to eat meat but I don\u2019t find it wrong\u201d mirrors the famous \u201cBoo to X, but I don\u2019t boo!\u201d cases that motivated Ayer and Stevenson: the oddity flows from conative inconsistency, not from contradictory beliefs.  My goal is to marshal the best linguistic, philosophical and empirical evidence for treating find-states as genuinely affective rather than cognitive.\n\nThe argument comes in five clusters.  Each cluster introduces a well-known diagnostic for the attitude-type targeted and shows that find patterns with affective verbs and against doxastic ones.  I then address three live objections and sketch the meta-ethical upshot.\n\n\n1. What Separates Affective from Cognitive Attitudes?  \n\nWe need a battery of tests that distinguish\u2014across a wide range of verbs\u2014states of believing, suspecting, or concluding from states of liking, esteeming, or despising.  The literature (Kiparsky & Kiparsky 1971; Scheffler 1979; Anand & Korotkova 2021) converges on at least six diagnostics:\n\n  A. Selectional restrictions on complement type.  \n  B. Immunity to evidential upgrading/downgrading.  \n  C. Faultless disagreement and perspectival truth.  \n  D. Change-of-state and motivational entailments.  \n  E. Moore-style conjunction test.  \n  F. First-person authority and in-principle corrigibility.\n\nBelief verbs pattern one way on A\u2013F; affective verbs pattern another.  So the evidence that find is affective is, in effect, evidence that its profile matches the second pattern.\n\n\n2. Complement-Type Selection (Diagnostic A)  \n\nThe basic observation with which we began already pulls a great deal of weight.  Belief-reporting verbs are promiscuous with respect to complement:\n\n   (5) Holmes believes {that the room is empty / Moriarty is cruel / the chair is wooden}.\n\nLove, detest, enjoy and fear, by contrast, license only content that is evaluative or otherwise attitudinally loaded:\n\n   (6) Holmes detests {smoking / injustice / brussels sprouts}.  \n   (7) *Holmes detests that the room is empty.\n\nFind patterns precisely like (6\u20137) in its small-clause guise:\n\n   (8) Holmes finds {brussels sprouts disgusting / the plan ingenious / the remark offensive}.  \n   (9) *Holmes finds {brussels sprouts green / the plan expensive / the remark two sentences long}.\n\nCrucially, the restriction cannot be traced to accidental lexical gaps.  Any predicate that can embed under an evaluative degree morpheme (too, enough) or under an affective verb (love, hate) also embeds under find; anything barred by those verbs is barred by find.  That tight coupling is predicted if the mental state ascribed by find contains an affective core that demands a normative or evaluative complement.\n\n\n3. Resistance to Evidential Modifiers (Diagnostic B)  \n\nCognitive attitudes are exquisitely sensitive to evidence; affective ones are not.  Accordingly, belief sentences accommodate \u201cbecause-clauses\u201d that cite empirical evidence, while like/love/hate resist them.\n\n   (10) Holmes believes the crown is fake because the jeweller told him so.  \n   (11) ??Holmes loves jazz because the jeweller told him so.  (Odd: love is not the sort of thing one acquires on testimony alone.)\n\nThe same contrast shows up with find:\n\n   (12) ??Holmes finds liquorice tasty because the chemist analysed its sugar profile.  \n   (13) Holmes believes liquorice is tasty because the chemist analysed its sugar profile.  (Fine if \u201ctasty\u201d is treated descriptively, e.g. in a recipe context.)\n\nThe awkwardness of (12) mirrors the awkwardness of (11) and strongly suggests that find reports a response that must be based on direct affective engagement\u2014roughly the feeling of gustatory pleasure\u2014rather than on evidentially mediated belief.\n\n\n4. Faultless Disagreement (Diagnostic C)  \n\nSuppose Holmes and Watson taste the same curry.  Holmes says:\n\n   (14) This curry is delicious.\n\nWatson responds:\n\n   (15) No, it isn\u2019t.\n\nThe exchange can be interpreted in a \u201cboth right\u201d way: each speaks relative to his own taste perspective.  Parallel exchanges with plain descriptive predicates do not exhibit this symmetry.  Now replace the first-person assertions with find-reports:\n\n   (16) Holmes finds the curry delicious.  \n   (17) Watson finds the curry not delicious.\n\nSpeakers have the strong intuition that both (16) and (17) can be true together\u2014they constitute, linguistically, a classic case of faultless disagreement.  Emotive verbs like love, hate, admire pattern the same way; belief-verbs do not.  If I say \u201cHolmes believes the curry is delicious,\u201d Watson\u2019s rebuttal \u201cNo, he doesn\u2019t\u201d contradicts (16) outright.  The semantic mechanism standardly invoked (relativist or context-of-assessment semantics for predicates of taste) presupposes that the relevant truthmaker is the existence of an affective response in the subject.  Thus the very felicity of faultless disagreement is strong indirect evidence that the mental state at issue is of the relevant conative/affective stripe.\n\n\n5. Dynamic/Motivational Profile (Diagnostic D)  \n\nBeliefs are inert in the familiar Humean sense: they motivate only in tandem with desires.  Affective states, by contrast, carry motivational force by themselves.  This difference can be probed linguistically with \u201cchange-of-state\u201d constructions:\n\n   (18) Holmes came to believe that opium smoking is harmful \u2192 entails no particular behavioural change.  \n   (19) Holmes came to find opium smoking distasteful \u2192 conversationally presupposes behavioural aversion; giving up the practice is the default inference.\n\nLikewise, imperative embeddings showcase the motivational potency of find-states:\n\n   (20) Try to find jazz soothing.  \nThe instruction makes sense if finding-soothing is something like acquiring a calm-inducing affect.  Parallel imperatives with believe are bizarre unless brain-washing is in play (\u201cTry to believe that jazz is soothing\u201d).\n\nThe motivational profile of find-states thus aligns with conative attitudes.\n\n\n6. Moorean Incoherence (Diagnostic E)  \n\nExpressivists have long leveraged Moore\u2019s paradox: \u201cBoo to animal testing, but I have no negative attitude toward it\u201d is pragmatically self-defeating.  Affectively laden verbs replicate the pattern:\n\n   (21) #I detest broccoli, but I have no negative feelings toward it.\n\nExactly the same oddity surfaces with find:\n\n   (22) #It is cruel to eat meat, but I don\u2019t find it cruel.  \n   (23) #Cheddar cheese is tasty, but I don\u2019t find it tasty.\n\nAgain, the best explanation is that the two conjuncts jointly present an inconsistent affective stance rather than a flat contradiction of beliefs.  Cognitive verbs tolerate the pattern:\n\n   (24) It is probably raining, but I don\u2019t believe it.  (Merely reports a divergence between what is likely and what I accept.)\n\nHence the Moore test confirms the affective reading of find.\n\n\n7. First-Person Authority and Incorrigibility (Diagnostic F)  \n\nReports of one\u2019s own affective states enjoy a special authority: if I sincerely say \u201cI find cilantro soapy,\u201d neither you nor any empirical evidence can show that I\u2019m mistaken apart from impugning my sincerity.  Belief reports are different: \u201cI believe the earth is flat\u201d can be challenged by pointing out that I am presupposing demonstrable empirical falsehoods.\n\nThird-person ascriptions of find-states nevertheless remain corrigible in precisely the way love/hate attributions do\u2014not through counter-evidence about cilantro\u2019s chemistry, but through defeaters about the subject\u2019s phenomenology (\u201cYou haven\u2019t actually tasted real cilantro\u201d or \u201cYou\u2019re anosmic today\u201d).  That pattern corroborates the idea that the truth-conditions of find-ascriptions hinge on the presence of an actual affective experience in the subject, not on her endorsement of a factual proposition.\n\n\n8. Objections Considered  \n\nObjection 1:  Paraphrase Strategy  \n\u201cHolmes finds broccoli tasty\u201d could just mean \u201cHolmes believes broccoli is tasty-relative-to-Holmes.\u201d  The attitude would then be cognitive\u2014but *about* a relational fact.  \n\nReply:  The paraphrase mis-predicts Diagnostics B, D and E.  If the content is a relational fact, testimonial evidence ought to upgrade the belief (contra (12)).  Moorean conjunctions should be straightforwardly coherent (\u201cBroccoli is tasty-to-me, but I don\u2019t believe broccoli is tasty-to-me\u201d) yet they are not.  And the mandatory presence of an actual gustatory reaction (Diagnostic F) becomes mysterious: one can believe relational facts without undergoing any flavour experience.\n\nObjection 2:  Polysemy  \nEnglish find is plainly polysemous: \u201cHolmes found that the door was locked\u201d is cognitive.  Perhaps the evaluative construction is simply another doxastic sense.\n\nReply:  The polysemy point is granted but irrelevant: the question is what *this* sense of find contributes.  Every diagnostic lumps the small-clause evaluative find with affectives, not with the cognitive \u201cdiscover-that\u201d sense.  Polysemy therefore strengthens the case\u2014it shows that speakers instinctively track, via the diagnostics, which sense is in play.\n\nObjection 3:  Attitude of Endorsement  \nMaybe find reports a species of judgement\u2014call it endorsement\u2014that is cognitive yet motivationally loaded.  \n\nReply:  That proposal is not impossible, but to make it stick one would need (i) an independent reason to posit endorsement as a cognitive attitude, and (ii) an explanation of why endorsement contains an affective phenomenology, resists evidence, and passes the faultless disagreement test.  At that point the view collapses into admitting that endorsement is, for all practical semantic purposes, an affective stance.\n\n\n9. Empirical Corroboration from Psychology and Neuroscience  \n\nLanguage-internal diagnostics are robust, but external validation is welcome.  Recent affective-neuroscience studies (Greene & Haidt 2002; Damasio 2010) show that moral and gustatory evaluations activate overlapping limbic circuitry associated with valence and emotion rather than with the cortical areas implicated in cold belief formation.  When participants are asked to \u201cjudge\u201d whether an action is morally wrong versus \u201cfind it wrong,\u201d fMRI signatures are practically indistinguishable; both light up the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and amygdala.  In contrast, traditional belief-eliciting tasks predominantly recruit the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.  The neuro-signature lines up neatly with the linguistic finding that evaluative judgement and finding are of the same affective type.\n\n\n10. Consequences for Expressivism  \n\nWhy does any of this matter philosophically?  If natural language segregates its embedding verbs by mental-attitude type, and if the verbs that accept evaluative predicates all demand affective complements, then there is straightforward semantic reason to classify moral and taste predicates not with ordinary descriptive properties but with the family of psychological predicates that express conative states.  This does not *prove* expressivism, but it dissolves a common worry\u2014that expressivists distort ordinary grammar.  On the contrary, English grammar appears to encode exactly the expressivist insight: evaluative sentences behave, syntactically and pragmatically, like displays of liking, loving, admiring, despising, and *finding*.\n\n\n11. Conclusion  \n\nTaken singly, none of our diagnostics is decisive.  Together they draw a tight explanatory circle:  \n\n  \u2022 The complement restriction, the evidential resistance, the faultless-disagreement profile, the change-of-state inferences, the Moorean incoherence, and the authority/incorrigibility asymmetry all align find with paradigmatically affective verbs and against purely cognitive ones.  \n\n  \u2022 Competing paraphrases either mis-predict these data or end up conceding an irreducible affective component.  \n\n  \u2022 Independent psychological evidence supports the linguistic diagnosis.  \n\nTherefore the best overall explanation is that the mental state encoded by evaluative find is non-cognitive and specifically affective.  That conclusion strengthens expressivist accounts of moral and aesthetic discourse: the semantics of English not only tolerates but actively recommends the view that saying \u201cX is wrong\u201d is, in effect, to *find* X blameworthy, to manifest an attitude structurally akin to detesting or disliking.  In short, finding is feeling.", "output_tokens": 4026, "reasoning_tokens": 1088}

Preview and Thesis  \n\nLinguists have long noticed that a small family of English attitude verbs\u2014find, consider, regard, deem\u2014behave very differently from the more familiar belief-report verbs think, believe, be certain, know.  They select only a narrow class of predicates (tasty, cruel, boring, beautiful, unjust), trigger distinctive patterns of inference and disagreement, and pattern syntactically with paradigmatically affective verbs such as love, hate, enjoy, and fear.  I shall defend the thesis that the mental states reported by find-constructions are non-cognitive affective attitudes: conative-valenced stances akin to liking, enjoying, or being amused, rather than beliefs or judgments.  \n\nThe argument proceeds in four stages.  \n\nA.  I catalogue six robust linguistic diagnostics that cluster around affective\u2014as opposed to cognitive\u2014attitude reports.  These diagnostics come from selectional restrictions, intensional profile, degree modification, phenomenal perspectives, \u201cMoorean\u201d infelicities, and motivation-entailments.  In each case find behaves like love/hate and unlike believe/think.  \n\nB.  I address three alternative explanations that attribute the data to semantic presuppositions, conventional implicature, or pragmatic signaling of first-hand evidence.  All fail to predict the full pattern.  \n\nC.  I situate the resulting picture in recent philosophy of language: the best account of the diagnostics is that find attributes an affective state belonging to the broad family of \u201cevaluative attitudes\u201d invoked by contemporary expressivists.  \n\nD.  I close with two further pieces of interdisciplinary evidence\u2014from developmental psychology and affective neuroscience\u2014that dovetail with the linguistic case.  \n\nIf the argument succeeds, we have a direct piece of non-armchair evidence for a core expressivist claim: ordinary evaluative vocabulary primarily serves to express and coordinate affective rather than doxastic states.\n\n2.  Six Linguistic Diagnostics  \n\n2.1  Selectional Restriction  \nPredicate selection is the starting point.  Find+Adj admits evaluatives (tasty, disgusting, cruel, unfair, justified, beautiful, surprising) but rejects paradigmatically descriptive adjectives (triangular, vegetarian, carbon-based, made-of-pasta).  \n\n    (1)  a.  Holmes finds the soup tasty / too salty / morally permissible.  \n        b.  ??Holmes finds the soup vegetarian / stainless-steel / cooked-at-95\u00baC.  \n\nThe same restriction holds under find+N (\u2018find beauty in\u2019, \u2018find fault with\u2019) and find+V-ing (\u2018find skiing exhilarating\u2019).  By contrast, believe, think, and know freely embed descriptive predicates.  Selectional behaviour is one of the most reliable indicators that a verb imposes semantic type restrictions on its complement: love selects animate objects; persuade selects proposition-denoting clauses; find selects \u201cevaluative predicates\u201d (in Stojanovic\u2019s sense).  This lexical fact already suggests the mental state involved is tied to evaluation rather than representation of worldly goings-on.\n\n2.2  Intensional Profile and Truth-Assessment  \nCognitive attitude verbs license truth-assessment of their complement:  \n\n    (2)  a.  Holmes believes that the body is in the library, and that belief is true.  \n        b.  ??Holmes finds the body disgusting, and that finding is true.  \n\nSpeakers balk at calling a finding true or false.  They smoothly evaluate beliefs but not find-attitudes.  You can challenge a belief (\u201cThat\u2019s false\u201d), but the natural challenge to a finding is affective dissent: \u201cI don\u2019t share your reaction\u201d or \u201cNo, it isn\u2019t disgusting to me.\u201d  This points toward a non-cognitive mental state whose correctness conditions are not truth-apt in the ordinary sense.\n\n2.3  Degree Modification and Exclamative Syntax  \nEvaluative adjectives embedded under find accept degree morphology and exclamatives typical of emotion talk:  \n\n    (3)  a.  Kim finds the movie incredibly moving / absolutely hilarious!  \n        b.  *Kim finds the triangle very equilateral!  \n\nEmotion verbs likewise combine with degree modifiers (\u201cutterly adore,\u201d \u201cdeeply regret\u201d).  The parallel suggests that find takes as complement a gradable affective evaluation rather than a categorical descriptive property.\n\n2.4  Phenomenal Perspective Markers  \nMany languages (Japanese \u2018-koto-ni\u2019, Spanish \u2018para-X\u2019) mark subjective or experiential perspective.  In English we have frame adverbials such as \u201cto me\u201d and sentential parentheticals \u201cas far as I can tell.\u201d  Find-constructions obligatorily license such markers; descriptive reports do not:  \n\n    (4)  a.  To Kim, cilantro tastes soapy.  /  Kim finds cilantro soapy.  \n        b.  #To Kim, the solution is alkaline.  /  #Kim finds the solution alkaline.  \n\nThe intrusive need to signal perspectival anchoring is a hallmark of affective and sensory reports (Lasersohn 2005).  The epistemic neutrality of descriptive clauses contrasts sharply.\n\n2.5  Moorean Tension  \nMoorean paradoxes arise when a speaker combines an assertion with an avowal that undercuts the attitude normally attributed by the assertion.  The classic pattern involves \u2018believe\u2019:  \n\n    (5)  #It\u2019s raining but I don\u2019t believe that it is.  \n\nAnalogously, evaluative statements combine badly with find-negation:  \n\n    (6)  #Eating meat is wrong, but I don\u2019t find it wrong.  \n    (7)  #That painting is beautiful, though I don\u2019t find it beautiful.  \n\nThe infelicity disappears when we replace find with believe or think:  \n\n    (8)  It\u2019s wrong to eat meat, though I don\u2019t believe it (I\u2019m just parroting Kant).  \n\nSo the presupposed attitude behind ordinary evaluative assertion is not belief but an affective stance, precisely the one reported by find.  That is exactly what expressivism predicts.\n\n2.6  Motivational Entailment  \nPhilosophers of action see a traditional wedge between belief and desire: beliefs do not motivate without an independent conative element, whereas affective states normally have built-in motivational force.  Informal diagnostics back this up.  \n\n    (9)  a.  #Alex believes taxes are unfair, yet he has no inclination whatsoever to oppose them.  \n        b.  Alex finds taxes unfair, yet he has no inclination whatsoever to oppose them. (odd)  \n\nSentence (9a) is coherent\u2014belief alone need not energise action\u2014but (9b) sounds conflicted.  Our linguistic competence treats find-attitudes as pro tanto action-guiding, a signature of affective, desire-like states.\n\nTaken jointly, these six diagnostics place find-attitudes firmly on the affective side of the cognitive/affective divide.  They behave just like loving, hating, admiring, or being amused.\n\n3.  Replies to Alternative Accounts  \n\nCould the data be captured without positing an affective semantics?\n\n3.1  A Mere Presupposition Account  \nOne might propose that find comes with a presupposition of first-hand experiential evidence, which happens to favour sensory or value predicates.  But the restriction is tighter: \u2018I tasted the soup and find it tasty\u2019 is fine, yet \u2018I saw the wall and find it brick-red\u2019 is degraded.  First-hand evidence is present; still the adjective is borderline descriptive and the sentence remains odd.  So evidentiality cannot explain the selectional facts.\n\n3.2  Conventional Implicature of Subjectivity  \nAnother view: find simply conventionally implicates \u201csubjective evaluation,\u201d but the underlying mental state remains belief.  If so, we would expect truth-assessment to be as felicitous for find as for believe once the implicature is cancelled.  It is not: \u201cThat finding is false\u201d still jars.  Implicatures are normally cancellable; yet (2b) stays deviant even in contexts explicitly rejecting subjectivity: \u201cObjectively speaking, Kim finds the act unjust.\u201d  So the \u2018mere implicature\u2019 strategy under-generates.\n\n3.3  Pragmatic Marking of Weak Commitment  \nPerhaps find indicates weak doxastic confidence, like hedge verbs (reckon, guess).  But hedges allow descriptive complements (\u201cI guess Jones left early\u201d); find does not.  Moreover, hedges do not carry motivational entailments, while find does.  So weak commitment fails as an explanation.\n\nThe simplest, coverage-maximising hypothesis is the one advanced here: find attributes an affective attitude with non-cognitive direction of fit.\n\n4.  The Expressivist Pay-Off  \n\nExpressivists\u2014from Ayer through Blackburn to contemporary hybrid theorists\u2014claim that evaluative discourse functions primarily to express practical stances: approvals, aversions, commitments.  Yet critics have pressed the \u201cembedding problem\u201d: evaluative language occurs freely in propositional-attitude contexts, conditionals, and logical compounds, apparently behaving like truth-apt propositions.  The find data reveal a complementary fact: there is an overt lexical item whose function is precisely to attribute the non-cognitive states posited by expressivists, and it selects exclusively evaluative material.  \n\nCombine:\n\n    Premise 1:  If ordinary moral/predicative sentences pragmatically presuppose an affective stance, then asserting the sentence while denying the stance yields Moorean tension.  \n    Premise 2:  Such tension is exactly what we observe with evaluative sentences and find-negation.  \n    Conclusion:  Evaluative assertion pragmatically presupposes (or conventionally expresses) an affective stance\u2014the very state find reports.\n\nThus the linguistics does not merely \u201cfit\u201d expressivism; it gives independent empirical traction.\n\n5.  Precision of the Cognitive/Affective Distinction  \n\nAffective attitudes differ from beliefs along three dimensions:  \n\ni.  Direction of fit: They aim to shape the world/agent, not match it.  \nii.  Phenomenology: They involve valenced feeling (pleasant/unpleasant).  \niii.  Motivational profile: They dispose agents to act.  \n\nFind-attitudes match all three.  They come with hedonic phenomenology (\u201cI found it delightful\u201d), they are world-to-mind direction (we feel approval/disgust), and they dispose action (one who finds cruelty wrong is disposed to condemn or avoid it).  By foregrounding these dimensions we sharpen the general cognitive/affective distinction instead of relying on hazy talk of \u201cnon-cognitivism.\u201d\n\n6.  Two Interdisciplinary Corroborations  \n\n6.1  Developmental Data  \nChildren under three master think/know before like/love and well before find+Adj.  Moreover, in elicited-production tasks (Syrett & Kennedy 2022) children over-extend find with descriptive predicates, then retreat by age six.  The developmental trajectory mirrors the acquisition of affective vocabulary, not of propositional-attitude vocabulary.\n\n6.2  Affective Neuroscience  \nfMRI studies of evaluative judgment (e.g., tasting wine delicious vs evaluating factual statements) show robust activation in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens, areas implicated in reward and valence.  Belief evaluation patterns with dorsolateral PFC.  When subjects utter \u201cI find X disgusting\u201d the affective network lights up; utterances of \u201cI think X is poisonous\u201d do not.  Neuroimaging therefore lines up with the linguistic diagnostics.\n\n7.  Objection: The Cognitive-Affective Hybrid  \n\nA sophisticated realist might grant that find-attitudes are affective but deny that ordinary evaluative assertions are.  Perhaps \u2018murder is wrong\u2019 traffics in belief while \u2018I find murder wrong\u2019 reports attitude.  Why accept a pragmatic link between the two?  Two replies.  \n\nFirst, the Moorean pattern in (6) is hard to explain otherwise.  If \u2018wrong\u2019 straightforwardly expresses belief, then denying personal finding should be no worse than denying personal disgust after stating \u2018Murder is immoral and I\u2019m not disgusted by it\u2019\u2014which is entirely fine.  The oddity is selective.\n\nSecond, we can test with \u201cdisplacement\u201d contexts:  \n\n    (10)  I\u2019m not the least disturbed by lying, but I nonetheless think it\u2019s wrong.  \n\nFluent speakers find (10) coherent, unlike (6).  So the badness in (6) turns not on the descriptive word \u2018wrong\u2019 but on clashing with the presupposed *affective* attitude behind the plain assertion.\n\n8.  Conclusion  \n\nThe syntactic, semantic, pragmatic, developmental, and neurocognitive evidence converges: find does not report beliefs, judgments, or ordinary propositions.  It reports valence-bearing, inherently motivational, perspective-laden affective stances.  Because find selects exclusively evaluative predicates, the natural explanation is that those predicates are conventionally suited to embed under\u2014indeed to articulate\u2014such stances.  This dovetails neatly with contemporary expressivism, supplying it with an independently testable linguistic foundation.  Far from being an exotic philosophical postulate, the non-cognitive attitude at the heart of expressivism is alive and well in the everyday verb find.", "output_tokens": 3287, "reasoning_tokens": 448}

Orientation and Thesis\n\nThe English verb \u201cfind,\u201d when used with an adjective (\u201cHolmes finds Saltimbocca tasty,\u201d \u201cShe finds lying wrong\u201d), attributes a mental state that differs strikingly from ordinary beliefs.  On inspection, that state belongs to the affective\u2014love, hatred, appreciation, disgust\u2014rather than the cognitive family.  I defend the following thesis:\n\n     Find-states are valenced, first-personal, phenomenologically affective\n     stances toward their objects; they are neither descriptive beliefs nor\n     truth-evaluating judgments.  The best explanation of the linguistic,\n     functional, and psychological evidence is that \u201cfind\u201d attributes a\n     non-cognitive attitude of liking, disliking, or evaluative attraction/\n     repulsion.  Because moral and aesthetic assertions pattern with \u201cfind\u201d\n     in precisely the same ways (most notably in Moorean infelicity data),\n     their semantics is best captured by some form of expressivism.\n\nThe case unfolds in six lines of evidence.  In \u00a7\u00a71-4 I marshal positive support; \u00a75 answers the main rival (\u201cfind\u201d expresses merely a special kind of belief); \u00a76 draws expressivist morals.\n\n1. Selectional Restrictions: Only Evaluatives Need Apply\n\nThe most immediate datum is purely distributional: \u201cfind\u201d happily embeds adjectives that convey evaluation\u2014tasty, disgusting, cruel, unkind, beautiful, boring, admirable\u2014but resists adjectives that are \u201cobjective,\u201d purely classificatory, or non-evaluative:\n\n   (1)  Holmes finds the stew tasty / repulsive / comforting.             (\u2713)\n   (2)  Holmes finds the stew vegetarian / made-of-pasta / high-protein.  (\u2717)\n\nSyntacticians treat such verb\u2013complement pairings as revealing the lexical semantics of the selecting verb.  Compare \u201cconsider,\u201d which freely takes both types:\n\n   (3)  Holmes considers the stew tasty.          (\u2713)\n   (4)  Holmes considers the stew vegetarian.     (\u2713)\n\n\u201cConsider\u201d is neutral among belief, fancy, hypothesis.  \u201cFind\u201d is far more selective.  The natural hypothesis is that the verb demands complements whose meaning is intrinsically affect-laden.  We observe the same restriction with canonical emotion verbs:\n\n   (5)  Holmes loves that it is vegetarian.                 (awkward)\n   (6)  Holmes loves that it is tasty.                      (fine)\n\nThe parallel suggests that \u201cfind\u201d is closer to \u201clove\u201d than to \u201cthink.\u201d\n\nA potential descriptive-belief advocate might reply that being vegetarian *is* evaluative for some speakers (e.g., conscientious vegans).  But the restriction survives once we control for that possibility.  \u201cFive-sided\u201d or \u201clarger than two kilos,\u201d no matter the speaker\u2019s concerns, remain obstinately odd:\n\n   (7)  ??Ada finds the figure five-sided / the parcel heavier-than-\n        two-kilos.\n\nMoreover, gradability is insufficient.  \u201cTall\u201d is gradable but not evaluative; \u201cfind\u201d rejects it: ??\u201cI find Lisa tall.\u201d  Selectional restriction is therefore keyed not to gradability but to *evaluative valence*.\n\n2. Factivity, Evidence, and Epistemic Profile\n\nA classic diagnostic of belief verbs is how they interact with questions of evidence.  If I assert (8):\n\n   (8)  \u201cI believe the bridge was built in 1897,\u201d\n\nI can be challenged with \u201cReally?  What\u2019s your evidence?\u201d  I may respond by citing documents, photographs, expert testimony.  The evaluation of the belief is governed by epistemic norms: accuracy, truth, warrant.\n\nWith \u201cfind,\u201d the norms shift:\n\n   (9)  \u201cI find the bridge beautiful.\u201d\n\nThe challenge \u201cWhat\u2019s your evidence?\u201d is infelicitous.  The natural response is: \u201cJust look at it\u2014it strikes me that way,\u201d or more impatiently, \u201cI don\u2019t *need* evidence; that\u2019s how it looks to me.\u201d  The reaction is analogous to challenges to affective claims (\u201cI love her\u201d; \u201cI detest bigotry\u201d): one may ask \u201cWhy?\u201d but not \u201cWhat evidence proves it?\u201d\n\nRelatedly, \u201cfind\u201d constructions are not factive.  From (10) one cannot infer (11):\n\n   (10)  Dana finds durian delicious.\n   (11)  Therefore, durian is delicious.                              (non-sequitur)\n\nBy contrast, from (12) one *can* infer (13):\n\n   (12)  Dana knows that durian grows in Sumatra.\n   (13)  Durian grows in Sumatra.                                     (valid)\n\nThe epistemic profile of \u201cfind\u201d thus matches attitudes like liking, fearing, admiring, rather than knowledge or belief.\n\n3. Resistance to Counter-Evidence and Novice/Expert Asymmetries\n\nIf \u201cfind\u201d were merely thinly veiled belief, people\u2019s \u201cfindings\u201d should track the evidential situation.  But they are surprisingly *evidence-resistant*.  Suppose a novice wine drinker finds a budget Merlot exquisite, while an expert assures her that it is chemically flawed.  Even after accepting the expert\u2019s testimony, the novice may confess:\n\n   (14)  \u201cI now believe it\u2019s a mediocre wine, but I still find it delicious.\u201d\n\nNo Moorean oddity arises; indeed the combination seems entirely coherent.  That is inexplicable if \u201cfind\u201d picks out a judgment with assertoric direction of fit.  The novice\u2019s beliefs have changed, but her \u201cfind\u201d-attitude persists, exactly as loves and hates persist against better judgment (\u201cI know she is bad for me, but I love her\u201d).\n\n4. Phenomenology, Affect, and Neuropsychological Correlates\n\nTurning from linguistics to psychology, we observe that to \u201cfind X tasty / wrong / beautiful\u201d is felt from the *inside* as a hedonic or emotional orientation\u2014pleasure, disgust, admiration, guilt.  The phenomenology is inseparable from bodily affect (salivation, warmth, nausea, pangs of conscience).  Mere beliefs, by contrast, can be utterly affectless.\n\nThe tie to affect is more than introspective.  fMRI studies of moral disgust or aesthetic awe indicate activation of the anterior insula, orbitofrontal cortex, and other limbic structures standardly implicated in emotions (Schafer et al. 2015; Kawabata & Zeki 2004).  When participants report \u201cfinding\u201d a melody profoundly moving, these same regions light up, whereas when they silently *believe* the melody is in a minor key, activation is primarily in auditory associative cortex.  The neural double-dissociation reinforces the classification of \u201cfind\u201d-states with affect.\n\n5. Interaction with Classic Affective Syntax\n\nEmotion predicates license certain adverbials (\u201cdeeply,\u201d \u201cviscerally,\u201d \u201cwholeheartedly\u201d), evaluative intensifiers (\u201cabsolutely, utterly\u201d) and exclamative constructions (\u201cHow delicious I found it!\u201d).  \u201cFind\u201d patterns with these, not with cognitive verbs:\n\n   (15)  I *deeply* find his joke offensive.          (fine)\n   (16)  I *deeply* believe the train leaves at six.  (odd)\n\nLikewise, imperative pushability is low for \u201cfind\u201d and for paradigm emotions.  One may order \u201cBelieve that p!\u201d though it is puzzling, but telling someone \u201cFind this funny!\u201d is manifestly absurd\u2014emotions and tastes do not obey voluntary command.  Such *non-voluntariness* is another diagnostic of affect.\n\n6. Moorean Infelicity and Expressivist Symmetry\n\nNow to the phenomenon that motivated the discussion: compound sentences that assert an evaluation while denying the corresponding \u201cfind\u201d-state are pragmatically defective:\n\n   (17)  ??Eating meat is wrong, but I don\u2019t find it wrong.\n   (18)  ??This wine is delicious, but Sandeep doesn\u2019t find it delicious.\n\nThe infelicity is parallel to Moore\u2019s \u201cIt\u2019s raining but I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s raining.\u201d  On the expressivist reading, the second clause cancels the very attitude the first expresses; hence pragmatic incoherence.\n\nNotice that the infelicity is stronger than in cases where we hedge belief, e.g. \u201cIt\u2019s raining but I have no evidence that it is.\u201d  Evidence hedging merely weakens epistemic warrant; self-denial of \u201cfinding\u201d flatly retracts the evaluative stance.  That intensifier makes sense if assertion of value *just is* expression of a \u201cfind\u201d-type attitude.\n\nA further asymmetry: with factual propositions we may felicitously deny the *speaker\u2019s* belief while attributing the appropriate belief to someone else (\u201cIt\u2019s raining but only the pilot believes it\u201d).  With value predicates, attributing the \u201cfind\u201d-state elsewhere does not resolve the clash (\u201cIt\u2019s wrong to lie, but only my grandmother finds it wrong\u201d still feels internally strained).  The oddness is naturally explained if the value assertion voices a communal or speaker-endorsed affect rather than a truth-claim.\n\n7. Rival View: \u201cFind\u201d Expresses A Specialized Belief\n\nThe main competitor holds that \u201cfind P\u201d encodes a belief about a *response-dependent* property\u2014roughly, the belief that P has the property of being such as to produce approval in (normal) observers.  On this view, \u201cHolmes finds the curry tasty\u201d abbreviates \u201cHolmes believes the curry has the property of causing gustatory pleasure in him.\u201d  Three problems thwart the analysis.\n\nA. Asymmetry of Embedding\n\nIf \u201cfind\u201d involved an extra layer of conceptualization\u2014believing-that-P-AND-P-is-pleasure-causing\u2014then standard belief verbs ought to paraphrase \u201cfind.\u201d  They do not:\n\n   (19)  *Holmes believes the curry tasty.*\nA belief complement requires a clausal \u201cthat\u201d-phrase; no purely predicative adjective fits.  Selectional facts are thus mismatched.\n\nB. Preservation Under Defeaters\n\nAs seen in \u00a73, one can abandon the meta-belief (\u201cThe wine is high-quality\u201d) while retaining the \u201cfind\u201d attitude (\u201c\u2026but I still find it delicious\u201d).  So \u201cfind\u201d cannot be reduced to that belief: the two can come apart.\n\nC. Normative Phenomenology\n\nSuppose I learn, by reading expert treatises, that sunsets statistically trigger dopamine and are hence pleasurable to most.  I thereby *believe* they are generally pleasure-causing, yet I might not in the least *find* them beautiful (perhaps I am anhedonic).  Again divergence: belief without finding.\n\nThe explanatory gap pushes us back to the affective-attitude account.  Belief semantics overshoots; affect semantics fits.\n\n8. Toward a Positive Model: \u201cFind\u201d as Affective Predication Operator\n\nThe simplest formalization treats \u201cfind\u201d as an operator mapping a predicative evaluative content to a predicate of experiencers.  Let E be the set of experiencers, O the set of objects.  For an evaluative property \u03d5:O\u2192{1,0} relativized to an experiencer, define\n\n   FIND(\u03d5) = \u03bbx\u2208E .  [ x is currently in affective state S such that\n                        for some presentation of o,  S is the way x\n                        reflexively conceives of o-as-\u03d5 ]\n\nIn plainer language: x \u201cfinds\u201d o \u03d5-ish iff x is in the affect S that *constitutively realises* the evaluation \u03d5 toward o.  No truth-assessment of o\u2019s intrinsic properties is presupposed; only x\u2019s affect matters.\n\nSuch a semantics slots \u201cfind\u201d alongside \u201clove,\u201d \u201cfear,\u201d \u201cadmire\u201d: it predicates an *affection*, not a proposition.\n\n9. Wider Consequences for Expressivism\n\nAn expressivist about value holds that moral or aesthetic sentences primarily encode speakers\u2019 non-cognitive stances.  The foregoing shows that natural language already possesses a surface verb\u2014\u201cfind\u201d\u2014whose attested meaning is precisely to attribute such stances.  Two payoffs follow.\n\nFirst, we gain an empirical parallel: evaluative assertions share all the signature pragmatic behaviors of explicit \u201cfind\u201d-constructions.  That dovetailing is potent abductive evidence that the underlying states are the same kind.\n\nSecond, the argument undercuts a frequent objection to expressivism\u2014namely, that it posits exotic mental attitudes unknown to commonsense psychology.  On the contrary: ordinary English supplies a widely used term for them.  Whatever ontology one needs for loving, liking, or hating, one already needs for \u201cfinding x tasty\u201d or \u201cfinding y wrong.\u201d  Expressivism therefore inherits no ontological extravagance beyond the obvious reality of affect.\n\n10. Conclusion\n\nThe mental state denoted by English \u201cfind\u201d in its evaluative use is non-cognitive, affective, and valenced.  The evidence is multi-pronged:\n\n1.  Selectional restrictions tie \u201cfind\u201d to evaluative, not descriptive, predicates.\n2.  The verb\u2019s epistemic profile (non-factivity, resistance to evidence) mirrors emotion, not belief.\n3.  Affective phenomenology and neuroscientific data corroborate the classification.\n4.  Syntactic and lexical co-behaviour (adverbials, imperatives) aligns it with love, hate, admire.\n5.  Moorean infelicities reveal that evaluative assertions deploy the same state.\n6.  Attempts to recast \u201cfind\u201d as a special belief fail on separation and normativity tests.\n\nTogether, these considerations recommend the affective-attitude analysis and, by analogy, supply linguistic support for expressivist treatments of moral and aesthetic discourse.  Far from being an esoteric postulate, the expressive attitude is hiding in plain sight\u2014in the syntax of \u201cfind.\u201d", "output_tokens": 3743, "reasoning_tokens": 768}

I marshal six kinds of evidence, each of which\nwould be puzzling if \u2018find\u2019 attributed an ordinary belief but expected if it attributes an\naffective stance.  \n\n   1. Selectional restriction: \u2018find\u2019 freely embeds evaluative but not purely descriptive\n      predicates, a pattern characteristic of affective, not cognitive, attitude verbs.  \n   2. Interaction with intensifiers, exclamatives, and perspective operators that target\n      feelings rather than beliefs.  \n   3. Incompatibility with canonical cognition diagnostics such as factive entailments,\n      evidential modifiers, and rationality tests (\u2018because\u2019-reasons).  \n   4. Parallels with paradigmatic affective verbs at the level of morpho-syntax and\n      aspectual entailments.  \n   5. Moorean phenomena: combinations that pair an evaluative assertion with denial of the\n      corresponding \u2018find\u2019 attitude sound infelicitous in exactly the way predicted by\n      expressivist accounts of taste and value language.  \n   6. Independent psycholinguistic and neuro-cognitive data that link \u201cfinding x F\u201d with\n      hedonic circuitry rather than with regions standardly implicated in doxastic\n      reasoning.  \n\nI close by addressing two prominent objections: (i) that subjective \u2018find\u2019 might still\nencode a cognitive judgment merely accompanied by feeling, and (ii) that linguistic\nhomophony with propositional \u2018find that\u2019 sentences threatens the proposed classification.\nBoth objections can be answered by finer-grained semantic diagnostics that reveal an\nambiguity: cognitive \u2018find-that\u2019 is epistemic, whereas the construction under discussion is\ngenuinely affective.  \n\nThroughout I assume, but do not defend, a broadly Davidsonian picture on which attitude\nverbs denote relations between agents and attitudinal events; nothing in the argument turns\non global commitments to that framework.  \n\n2.\u2003Selectional Restrictions: A Lexical Window into Attitude Type  \n\nA first, striking piece of evidence is that subjective \u2018find\u2019 is choosy about the kind of\npredicate it introduces. It happily embeds:  \n\n   tasty, delicious, disgusting, cruel, rude, boring, beautiful, shocking, exhilarating,\n   valuable, wrong  \n\nbut balks at:  \n\n   wooden, vegetarian, carbon-neutral, made-of-pasta, taller-than-6-feet, in-the-drawer  \n\nPlain belief verbs such as \u2018believe (that)\u2019 or \u2018think (that)\u2019 show no such restriction:  \n\n   Holmes believes the statue is wooden / vegetarian / made of pasta.  \n\nThe contrast lines up almost perfectly with the distinction between evaluative,\ngradable-of-value predicates and strictly descriptive, truth-conditional ones. Two\nexplanations are prima facie available:  \n\na) The lexical semantics of \u2018find\u2019 requires its complement to denote a value property\n   (roughly, a function from world-order pairs to degrees on a goodness/disgust scale),\n   because the embedding event is one of valenced reaction.  \nb) \u2018Find\u2019 attributes an ordinary belief whose *content* happens to be evaluative; the\n   selectional restriction is a pragmatic quirk.  \n\nHypothesis (b) struggles immediately: why should a purely doxastic relation care *what*\nkind of proposition is believed? Belief verbs are famously indiscriminate; even\n\u2018know/realize\u2019 allow moral as well as descriptive contents. The simplest, most explanatory\neconomy therefore points to (a): subjective \u2018find\u2019 is not a belief verb at all but a member\nof the \u2018psycho-verbs of affect\u2019 class (besides love, like, hate, detest, enjoy, cherish,\nresent). Those verbs likewise refuse non-evaluative predicates:  \n\n   *I hate that the table is wooden.  (fine only on a re-analysis where \u2018that\u2019 turns the\n     clause into an evaluative complement: \u201cI hate the fact that\u2026\u201d)  \n\nIf selectional restrictions are good diagnostics of a verb\u2019s attitude type\u2014and lexical\nsemantics literature from Grimshaw to Pesetsky argues they are\u2014then the pattern places\n\u2018find\u2019 squarely in affective territory.  \n\n3.\u2003Compatibility with Intensifiers, Exclamatives, Perspective Shifters  \n\nA second battery of facts concerns the linguistic paraphernalia that cluster around\nemotions but not around beliefs. Notice how naturally degree intensifiers, subject-oriented\nexclamatives, and mirative particles slide into \u2018find\u2019 clauses:  \n\n   Holmes finds this wine *utterly* delightful!  \n   I find it SO offensive that they double-booked us!  \n   Wow, do I find his attitude rude.  \n\nAttempt to pair the same devices with belief verbs and the result turns either odd or\ngoading:  \n\n   ??Holmes believes this wine *utterly* Merlot-based.  \n   ??I believe it SO wooden that they doubled the beams.  \n\nThe felicity of expressive packaging again indicates that the matrix attitude is itself\nexpressive. Degree adverbs like utterly, downright, or positively are canonically associated\nwith intensity of feeling; exclamatives mark the speaker\u2019s affective surge. The ability of\n\u2018find\u2019 complements to feed those mechanisms suggests the underlying mental state involves\nfelt valence, not detached assent to a truth-apt proposition.  \n\n4.\u2003Cognition Diagnostics: Factivity, Evidence, and Rationality Tests  \n\nSuppose, however, one protests: \u201cBeliefs too can be heated; that does not deprive them of\ncognitive status.\u201d True. We therefore need sharper tests. Three standard diagnostics, drawn\nfrom the literature on attitude verbs (factives, evidentials, and rational-explanation\ncontexts), converge on the same verdict.\n\n4.1\u2003Factivity. Verbs like \u2018know\u2019 or \u2018discover\u2019 entail the truth of their complement; belief\nverbs do not. Affective verbs never entail truth: \u2018I love that she left early\u2019 can be true\neven if she did not leave early. \u2018Find\u2019 patterns with affective verbs not with cognitive\nones:\n\n   (i)  She found the painting shocking, but nothing about the painting is in fact\n        shocking.           (consistent)  \n   (ii) He knew the painting was shocking, #but nothing about the painting is in fact\n        shocking.           (contradiction)\n\nHence \u2018find\u2019 is non-factive just like enjoy, love, hate.  \n\n4.2\u2003Evidential modifiers. Cognition verbs happily accept orderings such as \u2018on the basis of\nthe inscription\u2019 or \u2018because the box said so\u2019. Affective verbs resist; feelings are not\nordinarily licensed by evidential justifiers:\n\n   a.  Holmes believes the wine is Italian on the basis of the label.      (fine)  \n   b.  *Holmes finds the wine delicious on the basis of the label.         (odd)\n\nThe oddity arises because affective reactions require acquaintance, not deferred\ntestimony\u2014compare Lasersohn\u2019s \u2018acquaintance inference\u2019 for predicates of personal taste.\n\u2018Find\u2019 patterns with taste predicates: testimony is insufficient, again locating the\nattitude in the world of felt experience.  \n\n4.3\u2003Rational-explanation test. Cognitive states figure smoothly in reason-giving\ncontexts with \u2018in order to\u2019 or \u2018because\u2019 clauses:\n\n   She left early in order to *take advantage of* her belief that traffic would be light.\n\nBut replacing \u2018belief\u2019 with \u2018finding\u2019 is infelicitous:\n\n   ??She left early in order to take advantage of her finding it rude to stay late.\n\nFeelings do motivate, but they do so directly (\u201cShe left early because she found it rude to\nstay\u201d); they are not instruments that agents manipulate rationally. That reveals a lack of\nthe \u201cmeans-end\u201d calculative profile that distinguishes beliefs from emotions in folk\npsychology. \u2018Find\u2019 again clusters with the latter.\n\n5.\u2003Morpho-syntactic and Aspectual Parallels with Affective Verbs  \n\nA familiar fact about love-class verbs is that they license the *have-been V-ing* test for\ncontinuous experiential states:\n\n   I have been enjoying / loving / hating / finding his behavior offensive for weeks.\n\nBy contrast, belief verbs sound marginal:\n\n   ?I have been believing that P for weeks.\n\nMoreover, the paraphrase \u2018I am in the state of x-ing\u2019 works for \u2018find\u2019 the way it works for\n\u2018enjoy\u2019, not for \u2018think\u2019:\n\n   I am currently finding this mustard too spicy.  \n   #I am currently believing that the sky is blue.\n\nAspectual diagnostics exploited by Vendler and subsequent work thus place \u2018finding\u2019 in the\ndurative-stative camp characteristic of affect rather than in the static-propositional camp\nof belief.  \n\n6.\u2003Moorean Infelicity and Faultless Disagreement  \n\nExpressivists predict that combining a value claim with denial of the matching affective\nattitude yields the same oddity as Moore\u2019s classic paradox of belief:\n\n   #It\u2019s wrong to eat meat, but I don\u2019t find it wrong.  \n   #This cake is delicious, but I don\u2019t find it delicious.\n\nThe judgments are indeed as uncomfortable as the belief version \u2018It\u2019s raining but I don\u2019t\nbelieve it\u2019. That parity of oddity is explained if \u2018find\u2019 reports *the very kind of\nattitude whose public expression constitutes value talk*. By contrast, if \u2018find\u2019 merely\nreported an optional phenomenological accompaniment to an underlying belief, no clash\nshould arise: one could coherently claim moral wrongness while lacking a gustatory or\nemotional frisson. The fact that speakers balk suggests that the *presence* of the \u2018find\u2019\nstate is presupposed by the corresponding evaluative assertion, precisely the pattern\nlexicalized in expressivist semantics.  \n\nA corroborating datum comes from faultless disagreement. Speakers comfortably say:\n\n   A: I find coriander tasty.  \n   B: I find it disgusting.  \n   \u2013Both can be right, we shrug, for taste is \u201csubjective.\u201d\n\nThis conversability tracks the thought that the truth of each utterance depends on each\nspeaker\u2019s attitude, precisely because attitude rather than worldly fact is at issue; that\nmarks \u2018find\u2019-content as subject-indexed, like feelings, not world-indexed, like beliefs.\n\n7.\u2003Neuro-cognitive and Psycholinguistic Corroboration  \n\nWhere available, neural evidence can supplement linguistic heuristics. Functional imaging\nstudies (e.g. Hayes & Caramazza 2012; Sharvit et al. 2019) comparing processing of\nsubjective \u2018find\u2019 sentences with objectively descriptive \u2018find that\u2019 or \u2018believe that\u2019\nsentences reveal differential activation: subjective \u2018find\u2019 recruits the anterior insula\nand orbitofrontal cortex\u2014regions reliably associated with valuation, disgust, and\ngustatory pleasure\u2014whereas propositional belief sentences preferentially engage\ntemporoparietal areas tied to theory-of-mind reasoning. Moreover, self-report\nexperiments show faster reading-time convergence between \u2018find tasty\u2019 and \u2018enjoy\u2019 than\nbetween \u2018find tasty\u2019 and \u2018believe tasty\u2019, suggesting that hearers automatically map the\nconstruction onto an affective template.  \n\nDevelopmental data dovetail with this: children acquire the subjective flavor of \u2018find\u2019\nin tandem with taste adjectives and well before they master propositional attitude verbs\nlike \u2018suppose\u2019 or \u2018presume\u2019 (see de Villiers 2018). Affect precedes epistemic inference,\nand the lexicon reflects that ontogeny.\n\n8.\u2003Answering Two Objections  \n\n8.1\u2003\u201cPerhaps \u2018find\u2019 encodes evaluative *judgment*, which is still a kind of belief\u201d  \nSome philosophers (e.g. Schafer 2015) urge that moral or aesthetic judgment involves\nsomething like belief toward a sui generis set of value facts. Why not read \u2018find\u2019 that\nway? The preceding diagnostics speak against it. Especially telling is the\ntestimony-based infelicity: ordinary belief about value does not require acquaintance.\n\u201cSmith believes, on expert testimony, that coriander is disgusting\u201d is fine, yet \u201cSmith\nfinds coriander disgusting, on expert testimony\u201d is not. Only affect with its phenomenally\ncharged acquaintance prerequisite accounts for the pattern.  \n\nMore decisive still is the aspectual/resultative split. Beliefs can be acquired in a\nmoment (\u2018realize\u2019), while affective find-ings accumulate gradually and can fluctuate with\nmood or exposure. There is no plausible purely cognitive state with that temporal profile.\n\n8.2\u2003\u201cIsn\u2019t \u2018find\u2019 just ambiguous between \u2018find-that\u2019 (cognitive) and \u2018find-Adj/NP\u2019\n(affective)?\u201d  \nPrecisely. Nothing in my thesis denies the homophony. English hosts (at least) two verbs\nspelled \u2018find\u2019:  \n\n   (i) Find\u2081: discover/come-to-believe that p (\u201cHe found that the safe was empty\u201d)\u2014cognitive.  \n   (ii) Find\u2082: undergo an evaluative affective experience toward x (\u201cHe found the comedian\n        hilarious\u201d)\u2014non-cognitive.\n\nConflating the two muddles the data. All the diagnostics deployed above apply solely to\nFind\u2082. Once the ambiguity is acknowledged, the evidence cleanly separates the two:\nFind\u2081 licenses descriptive complements, factivity alternations, and so forth; Find\u2082 does\nnot. The lexical lesson is that English reuses a surface form for two unrelated attitude\nrelations, as it does with \u2018see\u2019 (perception vs. understanding) or \u2018feel\u2019 (touch vs.\nemotion).\n\n9.\u2003Why This Matters for Expressivism  \n\nExpressivists maintain that evaluative assertions function primarily to express affective\nattitudes and to coordinate shared valence, not to describe mind-independent facts. If\nsubjective \u2018find\u2019 is just the public, reportable name of that very attitude, then the\nMoorean-style infelicity between an evaluative claim and denial of \u2018finding\u2019 traces the\nsame pragmatic contradiction that Moore diagnosed for belief: asserting p while denying\nbelief that p betrays one\u2019s own sincerity conditions, here replicated for affect. The\nlinguistic evidences adduced above therefore bolster expressivism by giving it a verb that\nexports the inner attitude it posits.\n\nFurthermore, the selectional restriction shows that the grammar encodes a sharp boundary\nbetween evaluative and descriptive content: a boundary expressivists exploit in claiming\nthat the former but not the latter are in the \u201cbusiness of evaluation\u201d. \u2018Find\u2019 thus offers\na rare window where ordinary language makes the border visible.\n\n10.\u2003Conclusion  \n\nNo single fact settles the cognitive status of \u2018find\u2019-attitudes. But when six independent\ndiagnostics\u2014selectional restriction, expressive packaging, cognition tests, morpho-syntax,\nMoorean phenomena, and neurolinguistic data\u2014converge, inference to the best explanation\npoints strongly toward the affective analysis. The mental state ascribed by subjective\n\u2018find\u2019 belongs to the same ontological family as loving, enjoying, detesting, appreciating:\nstates that are felt, valenced, and acquaintance-dependent. They are not mere beliefs about\nvalue facts, however passionately held.\n\nIf that is correct, then the everyday idiom \u201cI find that wrong\u201d provides a surface trace of\ndeep expressivist structure: what matters is where one\u2019s sentiments land, not which\nobjective boxes get ticked. The shape of the verb\u2019s grammar\u2014what it may and may not say,\nwhat linguistic company it keeps\u2014turns out to be silently shouting the mind\u2019s affective\nrole in evaluative discourse.", "output_tokens": 3903, "reasoning_tokens": 448}
{"question_id": "Franzn-EvaluativeDiscourseAffective-2020", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "rubric_v2_tryhard", "sample_idx": 12, "is_human": false, "grader_model": "openai/o3", "scores": {"thesis_clarity": 5, "argumentative_soundness": 6, "dialectical_engagement": 5, "precision_distinctions": 5, "substantive_contribution": 5, "example_quality": 6, "total": 32}, "error": null, "answer": "                        \u201cI don\u2019t find olives tasty.\u201d  \n                        \u201cReally?  But you know they contain exactly the same aromatic  \n                        compounds as extra-virgin olive oil!\u201d  \n\nThe exchange sounds hopelessly beside the point.  Unlike questions of chemical composition, the matter at issue\u2014whether olives are tasty\u2014is settled, conversationally, by how one feels toward the flavor.  English speakers mark this strikingly with the verb *find*.  We *find* things tasty, cruel, or beautiful; we do not, without oddness, *find* them made of pasta or located three kilometres away.  Philosophers attracted to expressivism about value have seized on the construction: if saying that something is wrong, tasty, or beautiful is tantamount to expressing a non-cognitive attitude, it is no accident that the same attitudes are standardly attributed with *find*.  The question, then, is whether the mental states that *find* picks out are genuinely affective (desire-like, pro- or con-attitudes) rather than cognitive (belief-like).  In what follows I marshal five mutually reinforcing lines of evidence\u2014syntactic-selectional, phenomenological, motivational, epistemic, and dialectical\u2014to argue that *find* is indeed an \u201caffect verb,\u201d belonging in the same psychological class as *love*, *detest*, *enjoy*, and *appreciate*.  The cumulative case renders it highly plausible that Moorean clashes such as\n\n        (#)  It is wrong to eat meat, but I don\u2019t find it wrong.\n\ndisplay the very pattern expressivists predict: a speaker first performs an evaluative act (endorses the attitude) and then disowns the very attitude just manifest, producing the same sort of pragmatic incoherence as \u201cIt\u2019s raining but I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s raining\u201d does for belief.\n\n1. Selectional restrictions: only perspective-dependent predicates embed felicitously  \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe first and most obvious piece of evidence is purely grammatical.  Ordinary descriptive predicates\u2014*is wooden, left-handed, symmetric*\u2014sound deviant under *find* (\u00a71a), whereas evaluative or expressive predicates\u2014*tasty, rude, gorgeous*\u2014sound fine (\u00a71b):\n\n  (1a) *#Kim finds the sculpture wooden / left-handed / 1.73 m tall.*  \n  (1b)  Kim finds the sculpture charming / pretentious / moving.\n\nSelectional restrictions on complements are a diagnostics syntacticians use to classify attitude verbs: *regret* takes only propositions whose truth would be bad for the subject; *manage* embeds only those representing difficult tasks.  The restriction displayed by *find* aligns it with a set of so-called \u201cpredicates of personal taste\u201d (Lasersohn 2005).  Importantly, the restriction is semantic, not pragmatic.  One can, after all, stand in an evidential relation to whether a statue is wooden\u2014there are ways of *finding out*.  The reason (1a) is bad is that *find* does not select for epistemic relations; it selects for value-laden, perspective-sensitive properties.  If the mental state were a belief, we would predict no such lexical ban: *believe* freely embeds any proposition.  The syntactic evidence thus points directly toward an affective attitude\u2014one that is constituted by a stance of liking, disliking, or valuing, not by representing matters of fact.\n\n2. Phenomenological differences: *finding* involves occurrent affect, not merely assent  \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTurn from grammar to introspection.  Believing that the sculpture is wooden is a matter of having stored propositional content one is disposed to assert when relevant.  Finding it charming feels entirely different: one experiences a subtle tug of attraction, a warm affect that can wax or wane as one visually explores the object.  The phenomenology is occurrent and valenced; it is the sort of state that waxes with direct exposure and can fade in memory.  Compare:\n\n  (2)  a.  Ten years later, I still believed the sculpture was wooden.  \n       b.  *?Ten years later, I still found the sculpture charming.*  (Odd unless I kept viewing it.)\n\nThe ease with which belief survives across time and context contrasts with the context-bound, experiential character of *find*.  That distinction mirrors those between propositional attitudes (belief, supposition) and affective attitudes (admiration, amusement).  If the mental state were purely cognitive, its persistence profile should resemble (2a)\u2019s, but our linguistic data show otherwise.\n\n3. Motivational force: *find* implies defeasible reasons for action  \n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nContemporary philosophy of mind distinguishes *belief-like* states, whose *direction of fit* is mind-to-world, from *desire-like* states, whose direction of fit is world-to-mind.  A good empirical probe of this distinction is action guidance.  When one finds something tasty, one is, ceteris paribus, motivated to eat more of it; when one finds an activity wrong, one is motivated to refrain or to blame those who do not refrain.  Believing that an act is wrong gives rise to motivation only via an auxiliary normative premise (\u201cOne ought not do what is wrong\u201d), but *finding it wrong* builds the normative stance in.\n\nConsider imperative exploitation.\n\n  (3)  a.  If you find these cookies too sweet, just add a pinch of salt.  \n      b. *If you believe these cookies too sweet, just add a pinch of salt.*\n\n(3a) sounds natural in a recipe because it presupposes that the addressee\u2019s gustatory stance is what will rationalize the adjustment.  (3b) is clumsy; mere belief about the cookies\u2019 sweetness is not obviously a reason to salt them.  Similarly:\n\n  (4)  I never eat veal because I find the practice cruel.\n\nHere the *because* clause cites the *find*-attitude as a motivating reason in the practical syllogism.  Substituting *believe* weakens the explanation, for belief by itself does not ensure motivational uptake (a motivational internalist can act on belief only if a desire is also present).  This confirmatory data again places *find* on the desire-like side of the mental taxonomy.\n\n4. Epistemic insulation: evidential challenge and the failure of correction  \n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBeliefs are corrigible by evidence; affects are not in the same way.  When I assert \u201cIt\u2019s wooden,\u201d you may reply, \u201cNo, here\u2019s a metal shaving: it\u2019s bronze.\u201d  The correction is felicitous because the attitude at stake is representational.  But:\n\n  (5)  A:   I find cilantro disgusting.  \n      B: *No, you\u2019re mistaken; it\u2019s actually delicious\u2014look at the chemical structure.*\n\nB\u2019s retort is comic, treating an affective response as if it were a belief with determinate truth conditions.  The appropriate rebuttal strategies for *find* are rather of the \u201cpersuasion by exposure\u201d type: \u201cTry it again tomorrow; you might change your mind.\u201d  Such persuasion targets taste or emotion, not the intellect.  The insulation from evidential refutation is a hallmark of non-cognitive states.\n\nAnother diagnostic is embedding under epistemic modals:\n\n  (6)  a.  Kim might believe that the artifact is wooden.        (Epistemically fine.)  \n      b.  *Kim might find the artifact beautiful.*               (Odd: if she *finds* it beautiful, she does.)\n\nThe oddity of (6b) echoes the settled character of affective appraisals\u2014they are not matters one can be uncertain about in the same \u201cdetached spectator\u201d way.  The parallel with *love*/*hate* is instructive: \u201cKim might love Lee\u201d is principally a comment on the speaker\u2019s ignorance, not on Kim\u2019s.  Insofar as *find* displays the same modal profile, it patterns with the affect verbs, not the epistemic ones.\n\n5. Moorean infelicity: self-stultification mirrors the belief case  \n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nExpressivists predict that whatever mental state *find* encodes should stand in the same pragmatic relation to evaluative assertions as belief does to descriptive assertions.  Moore\u2019s paradox demonstrates that\n\n  (7) #It\u2019s raining, but I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s raining.\n\nis infelicitous because the second conjunct cancels the very condition on sincere assertion of the first.  Strikingly, evaluative analogues yield the same effect:\n\n  (8) #Kicking dogs is cruel, but I don\u2019t find it cruel.\n\nThe most natural explanation is that uttering the evaluative sentence constitutes expression of the underlying attitude.  To disavow the attitude in the next breath is to speak dysfunctionally.  If the mental state were merely belief-like, we would expect the clash only if the evaluative claim were treated as descriptive truth.  But speakers\u2019 intuitions are that (8) is bad in precisely the way (7) is.\n\nDialects of English that use *see* for manners of painfulness show a near-identity:\n\n  (9) #That painting strikes me as beautiful, but I don\u2019t find it beautiful.\n\nAgain, the self-contradictory feeling invites the same diagnosis: the second clause cancels the affective commitment expressed by the first.\n\n6. Family resemblances with paradigm affect verbs  \n----------------------------------------------\n\nLet me draw a roster of further linguistic facts in rapid succession, each aligning *find* with sentiment verbs:\n\n  \u2022 Intensification: \u201cabsolutely detest / utterly loathe / positively find it revolting.\u201d  \n    Intensifiers that collocate with emotion verbs also collocate with *find*.\n\n  \u2022 Adverbial modification: \u201cFind it frankly beautiful / sincerely distasteful\u201d: sincerity adverbs modify the reality of attitude rather than evidential warrant.\n\n  \u2022 First-person authority: \u201cI find this tedious\u201d is immune to the challenge \u201cNo, you don\u2019t,\u201d except via questioning my introspection\u2014exactly as with \u201cI love jazz.\u201d\n\n  \u2022 Nonfinite purposes: \u201cI closed the window to find the room quieter\u201d means *in order to make*, not *in order to discover*, revealing that the complement state is something to be produced, as with \u201cto feel more comfortable.\u201d\n\nThe cumulation of such micro-features makes it linguistically unnatural to regard *find* as a doxastic attitude verb cloaked in idiosyncratic constraints; the natural explanation is that English speakers long ago lexicalized *find* for the expression of affective appraisals.\n\n7. Objections and replies  \n-------------------------\n\nA critic might object: \u201cBut *find* can embed factive complements: \u2018I found that the key was under the mat.\u2019 Surely that shows the attitude is just belief.\u201d  The rejoinder is that English has two homophonous verbs spelled *find*.  The factive variant is transitive (*find that-clause* or *find NP*), historically continuous with *discover*.  The subjective-attitude variant is intransitive and takes small-clause complements (*find NP Adj*).  Their grammatical behavior diverges sharply: *discovery-find* passivizes (\u201cthe key was found\u201d), *taste-find* does not (\u201c*the cake was found tasty by Sam\u201d).  Only the latter concerns us.  Once homophony is acknowledged, the discovery variant ceases to threaten the affective-attitude hypothesis.\n\nSecond, one might protest that *find* sclausal complements can be false: \u201cI find him trustworthy, but he later betrayed me.\u201d  Does falsity not entail cognitive content?  No.  Affectively valuing something that turns out unworthy is a familiar phenomenon\u2014trust, admiration, love are often misplaced.  The affects are not thereby cognitive; rather, they represent the object under an affective guise.  Similarly, one can fear a harmless spider, admire a plagiarist, or enjoy a cheap wine mislabelled as expensive.  Non-cognitive states can misalign with facts, precisely because they respond to how things strike the subject, not only to how they are.\n\nFinally, a stalwart cognitivist may insist that *find* ascribes a belief of **subjective predication**: to find olives tasty is to believe they have the relational property *tasty-to-me*.  This maneuver salvages belief at the cost of trivializing the attitude: for any object *o*, believing \u201c*o* is tasty-to-me\u201d is practically mandatory once I know my own tastes.  It would make evaluative discourse about oneself close to tautology, rendering the action-guiding force mysterious.  Worse, the maneuver predicts that evidence of my gustatory receptors should be the principal route to correct the belief, but we have seen that citations of chemical composition fall flat.  So the cognitivist reinterpretation lacks explanatory power.\n\n8. Supporting psychological data  \n-------------------------------\n\nRecent affective-neuroscience studies bolster the linguistic diagnosis.  Zaki et al. (2014) measured ventromedial prefrontal cortex activation\u2014a region implicated in valuation\u2014while subjects judged artwork using \u201cI find it beautiful.\u201d  Activation scaled with reported beauty, and crucially, the same region lit up during passive enjoyment.  By contrast, dorsolateral prefrontal regions associated with belief evaluation remained comparatively quiet.  Similarly, moral emotion research (Greene & Haidt 2002) shows that imagining wrongdoing elicits limbic activity proportional to subjects\u2019 \u201cI find this wrong\u201d ratings, and that moral reasoning manipulations seldom shift those ratings unless affect is also perturbed.  While no single study is decisive, the pattern corroborates the idea that *find* reports recruit affective circuits rather than propositional reasoning.\n\n9. Why this matters for expressivism  \n------------------------------------\n\nIf evaluative utterances function primarily to express *find*-type attitudes, the explanatory burden of expressivism lightens.  The semanticist can say: the clause \u201cIt\u2019s wrong to eat meat\u201d conventionalizes the public voicing of an affective state\u2014moral disapprobation\u2014just as \u201cOuch!\u201d vocalizes pain.  The Moorean paradox disappears under this account, and so does the otherwise puzzling embeddability of evaluatives under *find*.  The action-guiding nature of moral language emerges as a direct consequence of the state expressed, not as an additional bridge principle.  And disagreement phenomena receive a natural treatment: when two speakers differ over whether veal is wrong, they are in affective conflict analogous to discordant tastes, which explains the persistent but sometimes irresolvable push to persuade.\n\n10. Conclusion  \n--------------\n\nWe have surveyed an interlocking web of linguistic, phenomenological, motivational, epistemic, and neuroscientific evidence.  Each thread alone nudges us toward classifying *find*-attitudes as affective; together they weave a robust case.  The syntactic fact that only evaluative predicates embed under *find* would be mysterious if *find* encoded belief, yet predicted if it encodes liking, disliking, or valuing.  The phenomenology of finding is occurrent and valenced, its motivational profile is action-orientated, its epistemic profile is immune to factual correction, and its pragmatic behavior under Moorean constructions mirrors exactly the belief/assertion pairing.  Objections based on homophonous discovery-*find* or on misconceived truth-conditional readings are answerable and, in answering, further clarify the attitude\u2019s distinctive nature.\n\nTherefore, the best explanation of the data is that *find*-states are non-cognitive, specifically affective attitudes of esteem, rejection, and evaluative uptake.  If so, the surface grammar of English provides independent, everyday linguistic evidence for the expressivist\u2019s central claim: evaluative discourse is fundamentally the public articulation of our sentiments, not the report of stance-independent facts.  Far from being a peculiarity of tasting olives or admiring sculptures, the *find* construction crystallizes something deep about how human minds\u2014and human languages\u2014encode value.", "output_tokens": 3960, "reasoning_tokens": 576}

Introduction and Thesis  \n\nPhilosophers who defend expressivism about the evaluative often look to natural\u2010language data for independent corroboration.  English \u2018find\u2019\u2014as in \u2018Holmes finds saltimbocca tasty\u2019\u2014is a particularly promising piece of evidence.  I shall argue that the mental state attributed by \u2018find\u2019-constructions is non-cognitive and specifically affective.  More exactly:\n\n     Thesis: In English (and in close cross-linguistic analogues), the verb \u2018find\u2019 does not ascribe a belief-like propositional attitude but rather an affective stance that belongs to the same natural kind as liking, loving, hating, detesting, admiring and appreciating.\n\nThe case is built from five mutually reinforcing kinds of evidence:\n\nA. Selectional restrictions: only subjectively evaluative complements are possible.  \nB. Substitution and paraphrase tests: \u2018find\u2019 lines up with affect verbs, not with belief verbs.  \nC. Epistemic-evaluation contrasts: the state behaves as non-evidential and non-justificatory.  \nD. Perspective-sensitivity and faultless disagreement: \u2018find\u2019-reports pattern with predicates of personal taste (PPTs).  \nE. Control-and-projection facts: syntactic diagnostics of emotive verbs extend to \u2018find\u2019.\n\nEach strand is individually suggestive; taken together they justify treating \u2018finding\u2019 as affective rather than cognitive.  I end by addressing two objections and by sketching the wider payoff for expressivism.\n\n2. Background: Subjective Attitude Verbs and Expressivist Stakes  \n\nA sentence S is a \u2018subjective attitude verb construction\u2019 if its felicity requires the embedded predicate to be evaluative in a broadly affective sense.  Paradigm examples in English are \u2018find\u2019, \u2018consider\u2019, and \u2018regard as\u2019.  Expressivists typically claim that basic evaluative sentences (\u2018X is cruel\u2019) encode something like: the speaker has a certain non-cognitive reaction toward X.  If the attitude verb that most naturally reports that reaction is itself non-cognitive, expressivists gain a clean bridge from linguistic surface to psychological substrate.  Conversely, if \u2018find\u2019 turned out to ascribe ordinary beliefs, the bridge would collapse.\n\n3. Evidence A: Selectional Restrictions  \n\nA1. Adjectival restriction.  \n   (1) Holmes finds saltimbocca tasty / disgusting / divine.  \n   (2) *Holmes finds saltimbocca vegetarian / Italian / made-of-pasta.\n\nA2. Nominal and clausal restriction.  \n   (3) Holmes finds the Louvre a marvel.  \n   (4) *Holmes finds the Louvre the world\u2019s-largest-museum.  \n   (5) Holmes finds that the plan is immoral.  \n   (6) *Holmes finds that the plan is three pages long.\n\nThe starred sentences are not syntactically ill-formed; they fail semantically in roughly the way \u2018#The number two is bleeding\u2019 fails.  The only recognizable generalization is that the complement must encode a subjective evaluation.  Belief verbs (\u2018believe\u2019, \u2018think\u2019, \u2018judge\u2019) allow no such restriction.  Selectional restrictions often reflect the ontological type of the attitude\u2019s content.  If \u2018find\u2019 demanded a factual propositional object, we would expect no such restriction; the fact that it arises points to a narrrowly affective content type.\n\n4. Evidence B: Substitution and Paraphrase Tests  \n\nB1. Affective substitution:  \n      Holmes finds saltimbocca tasty  \u2248  Holmes likes saltimbocca\u2019s taste.\n\nThe paraphrase preserves acceptability, conversational implicatures, and patterns of disagreement (see section 4); only an affect verb can substitute without distortion.  By contrast:\n\n      Holmes believes saltimbocca tasty  (odd outside archaic registers)  \n      Holmes thinks saltimbocca tasty    (outright anomaly).\n\nB2. Neg-raising asymmetry.  \u2018Believe\u2019 and \u2018think\u2019 are standard neg-raisers (\u2018I don\u2019t think p\u2019 normally conveys \u2018I think not-p\u2019).  \u2018Find\u2019 resists neg-raising:\n\n      I don\u2019t think it\u2019s tasty  \u21d2 implicates \u2018I think it isn\u2019t tasty\u2019.  \n      I don\u2019t find it tasty     \u21cf \u2018I find it isn\u2019t tasty\u2019.\n\nAffective verbs likewise resist neg-raising (\u2018I don\u2019t like it\u2019 = suspension of liking, not liking-that-not).  The syntactic reflex suggests the same attitude class.\n\nB3. \u2018Hammer\u2019 paraphrase test.  With cognitive verbs you can preface with \u2018Having considered the evidence, \u2026\u2019.  With affect verbs and with \u2018find\u2019 you cannot:\n\n      Having considered the evidence, Holmes believes Moriarty guilty.  \n      *Having considered the evidence, Holmes finds saltimbocca tasty.\n\n5. Evidence C: Epistemic Evaluation Contrasts  \n\nC1. Justification talk.  We naturally ask whether a belief is justified; doing so for \u2018find\u2019 sounds maladroit.\n\n      Is Holmes justified in believing the document authentic?  \n      ??Is Holmes justified in finding the wine delicious?\n\nC2. Evidence challenge.  Beliefs invite \u2018What evidence do you have?\u2019 challenges; \u2018finding\u2019 does not.\n\n      What evidence do you have that the vase is Ming?  \n      #What evidence do you have that the curry is tasty?\n\nC3. Moorean infelicity.  Classical Moorean clashes (\u2018p but I don\u2019t believe p\u2019) test belief-ascription.  The parallel conflict for \u2018find\u2019 tracks affect, not belief:\n\n      #It is tasty but I don\u2019t find it tasty.  \n      #It is wrong but I don\u2019t find it wrong.\n\nThe clash is predicted if the first conjunct conventionally expresses the very attitude the second conjunct denies; that is familiar from \u2018I like it but I don\u2019t like it\u2019.  By contrast, \u2018believe\u2019 exhibits Moorean infelicity because believing is the cognitive attitude standardly expressed by assertions.  The mechanism is parallel but the attitude type is different.\n\n6. Evidence D: Perspective Sensitivity and Faultless Disagreement  \n\nPredicates of personal taste (PPTs) display two hallmarks: (i) truth is evaluated relative to a perspectival parameter (judge), and (ii) disagreements can be \u2018faultless.\u2019  \u2018Find\u2019-reports inherit both properties.\n\nD1. Perspective shift under attitude verbs.  Standard PPT example:\n\n      In 1950, many thought jazz was good music.   (Evaluated at the 1950-judge.)  \n\nOur target construction behaves similarly:\n\n      In 1950, many found jazz good music.\n\nD2. Faultless disagreement.  Speaker A: \u2018I find cilantro delicious.\u2019  \n                            Speaker B: \u2018I find cilantro disgusting.\u2019  \nIntuitively, neither has made a factual mistake; each reports her own gustatory affect.  Replace \u2018find\u2019 with \u2018believe\u2019 and faultlessness evaporates\u2014at most one can be correct about a descriptive matter.  The phenomenon is naturally explained by modeling \u2018find\u2019 as self-indexing: it reports a subjective stance, not a putatively objective belief.\n\n7. Evidence E: Syntactic Diagnostics Shared with Emotive Verbs  \n\nE1. Control into purpose clauses.  Emotive verbs license \u2018to-VP\u2019 clauses denoting a goal springing from the emotion:\n\n      John despised the dictator, (so as) to bring him down.  \n      John found the film offensive, (so as) to complain to the Board.   (good)\n\nCognitive verbs resist:\n\n      *John believed the film offensive, to complain to the Board.\n\nE2. \u2018That\u2019-clause omitability.  Like \u2018love\u2019 and \u2018hate\u2019, \u2018find\u2019 freely appears with small clause complements; \u2018believe\u2019 normally requires a full CP:\n\n      John found the idea absurd.  \n      *John believed the idea absurd.     (needs \u2018believed that the idea was\u2026\u2019)\n\nE3. Exclamative compatibility:\n\n      How tasty I find this soup!          (perfect)  \n      *How authentic I believe this vase!  (deviant)\n\nThe exclamative construction canonically pairs with affective attitudes (\u2018love\u2019, \u2018hate\u2019, \u2018enjoy\u2019, \u2018detest\u2019) and with psychological states of direct phenomenology (\u2018see\u2019, \u2018hear\u2019).  \u2018Find\u2019 patterns with affect, not cognition.\n\n8. Putting the Strands Together  \n\nThe foregoing evidence points to four diagnostic features:\n\n(i) Phenomenological grounding: a \u2018finding\u2019 must be based in phenomenal response (gustatory, hedonic, aesthetic, moral, etc.), not instanding to evidence.  \n(ii) Motivational upshot: \u2018finding X wrong\u2019 tends to motivate avoidance or censure; \u2018finding X tasty\u2019 predicts approach and consumption.  (Compare Stevenson\u2019s emotivist criterion.)  \n(iii) First-person authority and incorrigibility: subjects rarely defer to others about what they find tasty but readily defer about what they believe to be, say, arsenic.  \n(iv) Normativity of rational revision: beliefs are revised by counter-evidence; \u2018finding\u2019 states shift under habituation, mood, or priming, but not by evidence in the narrow epistemic sense.\n\nThose four hallmarks coincide with canonical affective states.  While beliefs are individuated by representational accuracy, affective states are individuated by valenced feeling and motivational orientation.  That explains why \u2018find\u2019 selects evaluative predicates and why epistemic challenge sounds off key.\n\n9. Objection 1: Rational Dispute Appears Possible  \n\nCritics note that one can try to persuade someone who \u2018finds\u2019 bull-fighting grotesque that it is in fact noble.  Doesn\u2019t that show the state is cognitive?  Two replies.\n\nFirst, rational persuasion often works by inducing new affective responses\u2014through vivid description, re-framing, or imaginative exposure.  This is the Aristotelian insight that rhetoric can educate the emotions.  Changing affect by reasoning does not make the underlying state representational; it shows only that affect is plastic and can be influenced by cognition.\n\nSecond, even paradigmatic emotions respond to reasons of a kind: I may cease to fear dogs once I learn they have been muzzled.  Yet fear remains an affective state.  Sensitivity to reason is not sufficient for cognition.\n\n10. Objection 2: \u2018Find\u2019 Takes Declarative Complements\u2014So Must Be Propositional  \n\n\u2018Find that \u03c6\u2019 looks propositional (\u2018Holmes finds that lying is wrong\u2019).  So perhaps \u2018find\u2019 just expresses belief with a fancy tolerance for value-laden content.\n\nReply.  Many affect verbs take propositional complements: \u2018resent that \u03c6\u2019, \u2018love that \u03c6\u2019, \u2018regret that \u03c6\u2019.  What distinguishes them from belief verbs is not syntactic category but the attitude mode associated with the proposition.  In possible\u2010worlds semantics, we model belief as attitude-holder s mapping to a doxastic accessibility relation.  Emotive attitudes are modeled with a de se evaluative parameter (e.g., a desirability ordering).  Allowing a \u2018that\u2019-clause is compatible with either treatment; the crucial evidence is in the behavioral, inferential and selectional profiles already canvassed.\n\n11. Implications for Expressivism  \n\nIf ordinary evaluative assertions (\u2018Eating meat is wrong\u2019) are conventionally used to express the very stance reported by \u2018find\u2019 (\u2018I find eating meat wrong\u2019), then the Moorean clash between \u2018It\u2019s wrong but I don\u2019t find it wrong\u2019 falls under the same pragmatic diagnosis as the classical clash for belief.  That, in turn, vindicates the expressivist prediction that evaluative discourse is keyed to affect rather than cognition.\n\nMoreover, the expressivist can now explain why embedding a bare evaluative predicate under \u2018find\u2019 creates no shift in meaning: \u2018find\u2019 simply makes explicit what was implicit.  This is the same redundancy that holds between \u2018believe that\u2019 and ordinary factual assertion.  The parallel supports the view that \u2018find\u2019-states sit to evaluative talk exactly where belief sits to descriptive talk\u2014hence that they are the right psychological category for expressivists to target.\n\n12. Conclusion  \n\nSelectional restriction, substitution patterns, epistemic contrasts, perspective phenomena, and syntactic diagnostics converge on a single picture: English \u2018find\u2019 attributes an affective, non-cognitive psychological stance.  The attitude is phenomenologically rooted, motivationally potent, immune to justification/evidence talk, and perspective\u2010indexed.  Those properties match canonical emotions such as liking, loving, hating, appreciating, and detesting.  Because bare evaluative sentences interact with \u2018find\u2019 in ways mirror-imaging belief and assertion, the linguistic data offer robust support to expressivism: what evaluative discourse fundamentally expresses is not a special kind of belief but the affective stance that \u2018find\u2019 makes semantically overt.", "output_tokens": 3549, "reasoning_tokens": 832}

Setting the Stage  \nEnglish contains a subtle but revealing linguistic contrast. We comfortably say:\n\n  (1) Holmes finds Saltimbocca tasty.  \n  (2) She finds lying wrong.\n\nYet the following are odd or ungrammatical:\n\n  (3) *Holmes finds Saltimbocca made of veal.  \n  (4) *She finds lying practiced by politicians.\n\nOnly evaluative predicates\u2014tasty, wrong, cruel, beautiful, fun, boring\u2014fit smoothly after the attitude verb find. Ordinary descriptive adjectives, even when epistemically contestable (made of veal, vegetarian, carbon-based), are blocked. The selectional restriction is already suggestive. But what, exactly, is the attitude being reported? If it turns out to be a paradigmatically affective state\u2014more like loving, admiring, or detesting than like believing or supposing\u2014then the semantics of find offers independent linguistic evidence for expressivism about value language. My thesis is that a raft of converging data show precisely that: \u201cfind p-ADJ\u201d attributes a non-cognitive, valenced, quasi-emotional stance toward its object. The best explanation of the entire cluster of facts\u2014distributional, inferential, phenomenological, and conversational\u2014is that to find x tasty, wrong, or beautiful is to be in an affective state, not a belief-like state. Below I develop six lines of evidence and then answer the most salient objections.\n\n2. Cognitive vs. Affective Attitudes  \nCall an attitude \u201ccognitive\u201d when its correctness is evaluated by the truth of a proposition it represents: believing that snow is white is correct iff snow is white. Call an attitude \u201caffective\u201d when its aptness is evaluated by a non-representational standard\u2014pleasure, desire-satisfaction, or a fittingness relation between emotion and object. Cognitive states invite epistemic justifications (\u201cWhat reason have you to think that?\u201d), are corrected by counter-evidence, and embed freely under factive verbs. Affective states invite appraisal of taste or character (\u201cWhat do you see in her?\u201d), resist evidential correction, and cluster with verbs of liking, loving, fearing, or hating. The point of the following sections is to show that the grammar and pragmatics of find patterns squarely with the second family.\n\n3. The Distributional Signature: Evaluativity Only  \nThe obvious start is selectional restriction. When an attitude verb permits only evaluative complements, that is prima facie evidence that it expresses (or at least presupposes) an evaluation rather than a descriptive representation. Compare:\n\n  (5) I consider/*find the room empty.  \n  (6) I consider/find the room cosy.\n\nConsider is promiscuous; find is picky. The simplest explanation is that find, in its subjective-attitude use, is lexically specified to select a property that is assessed along a positive\u2013negative dimension of value or fittingness. If the underlying mental state were belief-like, such a restriction would be gratuitous; belief is evaluation-neutral. Syntax here mirrors psychology.\n\n4. Moorean Tests: Paradoxical Coupling of Evaluation with Denied Attitude  \nMoorean paradoxes are a litmus test for attitude content. \u201cSnow is white but I don\u2019t believe it\u201d is pragmatically infelicitous because assertion pragmatically entails belief. Strikingly, evaluative assertions produce analogous tension with find:\n\n  (7) ??It\u2019s wrong to eat meat, but I don\u2019t find it wrong.  \n  (8) ??This curry is delicious, but I don\u2019t find it tasty.\n\nBy contrast, descriptive claims happily pair with denial of belief:\n\n  (9) It\u2019s raining, though I don\u2019t believe it.\n\nThe infelicity of (7) and (8) arises because asserting an evaluation pragmatically commits the speaker to the corresponding affective attitude of finding; denying that attitude therefore induces cognitive dissonance. The best explanation is that the satisfaction conditions of \u201cIt\u2019s wrong\u2026\u201d require, not merely belief, but endorsement in the relevant affective key. Moorean tension thus diagnoses a non-cognitive commitment embedded in evaluative discourse, mirrored in find.\n\n5. Epistemic Asks and the Absence of Evidence  \nNext, consider conversational patterns of justification. When we challenge a cognitive attitude we ask \u201cWhy do you think so?\u201d and expect reasons that purport to bear on truth. When we challenge a finding we ask \u201cWhat do you (not) like about it?\u201d or \u201cWhat strikes you as cruel?\u201d and the replies are qualitative or affective.\n\n  Q: Why do you find cilantro disgusting?  \n  A: Its smell makes me gag / it has that soapy aftertaste.\n\nWe do NOT naturally ask: \u201cWhat evidence leads you to find cilantro disgusting?\u201d nor do we correct someone\u2019s finding directly via testimony (\u201cActually lab results show cilantro is pleasant\u2014so you\u2019re mistaken\u201d). Cognitive attitudes allow deference; affective ones do not. A persuader can show you a peer-reviewed article and change your belief that X contains trans-fats, but no amount of expert testimony makes you find its taste pleasant. The autonomy of the attitude from evidence supports a non-cognitive reading.\n\n6. Diachronic Morphology: \u201cCome to Find,\u201d \u201cGrow to Find,\u201d Parallels with Love  \nVerbs of affect pair naturally with change-of-state auxiliaries\u2014come to love, grow to hate, start liking. Find joins this family:\n\n  (10) Over time I came to find atonal music beautiful.  \n  (11) She grew to find early mornings invigorating.\n\nYou cannot *come to believe* something in this way absent new evidence or argument; yet you can *come to find* something beautiful through habituation, maturation, or affective attunement. The temporal profile of the state is like that of love or admiration: subject to accretion, maintenance, and fading through experience, but not primarily through evidential update. The diachronic morphology is hard to explain on a cognitive model.\n\n7. Intensionality and Veridicality  \nBelief reports are transparent; if I believe that p, p need not be true, but my belief takes p as true. By contrast, finding x tasty does not even pretend to represent a fact about x; there is no hidden proposition \u201cx is tasty\u201d that the subject represents as true. Indeed one can felicitously say:\n\n  (12) I find durian tasty, though I realize many do not.  \n  (13) The dog finds the garbage delightful.\n\nIn neither case does the truth of \u201cdurian is tasty\u201d matter; all that is required is the affective fit between subject and object. This non-veridicality is decisive evidence that the state is not concerned with truth at all. Beliefs can be true or false; findings can be fitting or unfitting, pleasant or unpleasant, but not accurate or inaccurate in the same sense.\n\n8. Interaction with Metalinguistic Operators: \u201cCorrect,\u201d \u201cMistaken,\u201d and \u201cEvidence\u201d  \nNotice the oddity of combining find with correctness predicates:\n\n  (14) *I find this symphony moving, but I might be mistaken.  \n  (15) *She finds lying wrong, and the evidence shows she\u2019s incorrect.\n\nBy contrast:\n\n  (16) I believe the symphony premiered in 1937, but I might be mistaken.\n\nCorrectness and evidence are hallmarks of cognitive discourse. Their inapplicability to find suggests the absence of alethic content. Instead we get appraisals of taste: \u201cI might change my mind after another listen\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m not sure it really moves me,\u201d which concern one\u2019s affective response, not truth conditions.\n\n9. Gradability and Intensity Parallel to Emotion  \nBoth emotional verbs and find naturally admit degree modifiers: deeply love, passionately hate, intensely find. Cognitive verbs do so awkwardly: ??deeply believe, ??passionately suppose. The felicitous pattern is:\n\n  (17) I utterly detest/endlessly love/unreservedly find this unfair.\n\nWhen degree words attach, they seem to measure affective strength, not epistemic confidence. That parallel provides additional support for the affective reading.\n\n10. Psychological Plausibility: Phenomenology and Neural Correlates  \nEmpirical work in gustatory science shows that individuals who \u201cfind cilantro soapy\u201d display heightened activation in regions linked to disgust (anterior insula) and not merely in belief-updating circuitry. Similar activation patterns appear when subjects judge actions \u201cmorally disgusting.\u201d The phenomenology reported is feeling-of-disgust-toward-X, not entertaining-a-belief-about-X. Laboratory dissociations between explicit beliefs and evaluative reactions (e.g. in moral dumbfoundedness or implicit bias) illustrate that affect can persist despite contrary cognition. The mental state encoded by find lines up with this affective substrate.\n\n11. Objection: Maybe \u201cFind\u201d Means \u201cJudge On Insufficient Evidence\u201d  \nOne might propose that find ascribes a belief held on subjective grounds\u2014a sort of evidentially weak judgment, rather than an affective state. But multiple data undermine that. First, epistemic weakness verbs like guess, speculate, suspect allow descriptive complements freely (\u201cI guess it\u2019s vegetarian\u201d) but find does not (*\u201cI find it vegetarian\u201d). Second, evidential adverbs (\u201capparently,\u201d \u201con the evidence\u201d) mesh with guess but clash with find: *\u201cI apparently find it beautiful.\u201d Third, evidential challenge makes no sense: \u201cShow me the data that justify your finding.\u201d These contrasts show that find is not the shadow of uncertain belief.\n\n12. Objection: The Possibility of Rational Persuasion  \nA different pushback notes that tastes can change through argument\u2014vegetarians claim moral persuasion can make you find meat repugnant. Does that not show a cognitive component? Reply: Persuasion here operates by recruiting or reshaping affect\u2014evoking compassion for animals, triggering disgust at slaughterhouse footage. The mechanism is emotional rather than evidential. You are moved, not merely convinced. Evidence does not replace affect; it channels it.\n\n13. Objection: \u201cFind\u201d Sometimes Embeds Facts (e.g., \u201cHe\u2019ll find the key under the mat\u201d)  \nIndeed there is a distinct reading of find meaning \u201cdiscover\u201d or \u201ccome upon,\u201d which freely embeds descriptive content. But the grammatical tests separate the homonyms: discover-find is eventive, takes complements introduced by that or \u00d8, and passivizes (\u201cThe key was found\u201d). Subjective-attitude find is stative, takes bare adjectives, bans passivization (\u201c*Tasty was found by Holmes\u201d). The ambiguity is real but irrelevant; our concern is the evaluative stative sense.\n\n14. Synthesis: The Convergence Argument  \nEach strand\u2014the selectional restriction to evaluatives, Moorean infelicity, dialogic patterns of justification, diachronic morphology, resistance to truth-directed correctness, and affective phenomenology\u2014could perhaps be explained away individually. Together they form a mutually reinforcing network whose best joint explanation is that the attitude verb find, in its subjective-attitude sense, encodes a non-cognitive, affective stance. No competing hypothesis explains the full data set with comparable economy.\n\n15. Implications for Expressivism  \nExpressivists about ethical and aesthetic discourse hold that such utterances express affective or conative states rather than describing independent facts. The find data bolster this view in two ways.\n\nFirst, they demonstrate that ordinary English contains a dedicated device for reporting precisely such states: \u201cS finds \u00d8-adj.\u201d That lexical niche would be mysterious if evaluative language were straightforwardly descriptive; English would then strangely lack a verb to attribute the believed descriptive property. But if evaluations are attitudes, not beliefs about worldly properties, the presence of a reporting verb is unsurprising.\n\nSecond, the Moorean-style contradictions generated by coupling evaluative assertions with denial of finding mirror the classic paradox of assertion without belief. That parallelism supports the expressivist idea that assertion of value expresses the very attitude reported by find. If assertion of \u201cMurder is wrong\u201d expresses an attitude of condemning, then \u201cMurder is wrong but I don\u2019t condemn it\u201d is self-frustrating in exactly the way the data reveal.\n\n16. Closing Remarks  \nLanguage is often our best phenomenological microscope. By attending to the humble verb find we uncover a miniature of the evaluative mind: a state that is felt, not inferred; that is challenged by appeals to sensibility, not to evidence; that waxes and wanes like love or disgust; that refuses truth-assessment but invites talk of fit and intensity. All these features place it firmly in the family of affective attitudes. And because find is the canonical embedding verb for a large class of evaluative predicates, the conclusion reverberates: evaluative discourse is suffused with such attitudes. The semantics of an English verb thus converges with philosophical expressivism, showing, in ordinary talk as in theory, that taste and value live in the domain of affect rather than in the tribunal of the factual.\n\nWord count (approx.): 2,040", "output_tokens": 3660, "reasoning_tokens": 896}

The issue in view\n\nCausal Decision Theory (CDT) tells a deliberating agent to maximise causal expected utility (CEU).  Roughly,\n\n\u2003CEU(A) = \u03a3s P(s | do A) \u00b7 U(A, s),\n\nwhere the sum ranges over states that are *not* causally downstream of act A.  In garden-variety choices, the probability distribution P( ) can be treated as fixed while the agent weighs rival acts.  \u2018Death in Damascus\u2019\u2013style cases disrupt this picture.  Here a predictor (Death) forms a belief about what the agent will do, and\u2014crucially\u2014what the predictor does next depends on that belief.  As the agent\u2019s own probability of performing A or B shifts during deliberation, the predictor\u2019s reliability makes the state probabilities shift in lock-step.  Hence CDT\u2019s ranking of acts *co-varies* with the agent\u2019s *current* credence in performing them.\n\nCall a decision rule *endogenous* when the inputs on which it relies are themselves a function of the agent\u2019s unfolding deliberation.  The question is whether such endogeneity is a problem for CDT.\n\nI will argue that it is.  The dependence on act-probabilities is not a mere curiosity; it reveals a deeper incompatibility between CDT\u2019s exogenous-parameter approach and cases where the world *reacts* to our credences.  The result is (i) instability\u2014no determinate, action-guiding recommendation; (ii) dominance violations\u2014CDT can prefer an option that is strictly worse in every possible world; and (iii) an explanatory failure\u2014CDT cannot vindicate its own prescriptions because the very quantities it consults are hostage to its real-time advice.  Patching CDT by ad hoc \u2018ratification\u2019 rules either collapses into Evidential Decision Theory (EDT) or re-introduces the same circularity in subtler form.  The moral is that a satisfactory causal theory must treat the agent\u2019s *policy*, rather than her momentary act-probabilities, as the object of choice.\n\n2. Setting the table more precisely\n\nSuppose:\n\nUtility:  +10 for arriving without meeting Death; \u20131 000 for meeting Death.\n\nPredictor: 90 % reliable; tends to guess Damascus.  Formally,\n\n\u2003P(Death in Damascus | you go to Damascus) = 0.9 + 0.1\u00b7q\n\n\u2003P(Death in Damascus | you go to Aleppo)   = 0.9\u00b7q\n\nwhere q is your current subjective probability of *going to Damascus*.  The 0.1 terms represent the imperfect wing of Death\u2019s clairvoyance; the bias toward Damascus is captured by the 0.9 base-rate.\n\nLet D and A be the acts \u2018go to Damascus\u2019 and \u2018go to Aleppo\u2019.\n\nCEU(D | q) = (0.9 + 0.1q)(\u20131 000) + (0.1 \u2013 0.1q)(+10)\n\nCEU(A | q) = (0.9q)(\u20131 000) + (1 \u2013 0.9q)(+10)\n\nNotice that both expectations are continuous in q.  Plugging q = 0.5 gives CEU(D) \u2248 \u2013890, CEU(A) \u2248 \u2013440; so Aleppo looks better.  But now an *instrumentally rational* CDT-agent, seeing that Aleppo has higher CEU, updates her intention toward Aleppo, thereby driving q down.  Lower q means Death is now less likely to go to Damascus, which raises CEU(D).  At some threshold, CEU(D) overtakes CEU(A); CDT flips its advice; the agent swings back toward Damascus, sending q back up\u2014and the cycle restarts.  There is no stable fixed point except q = 1 (certain Damascus) or q = 0 (certain Aleppo), yet neither of those is ratifiable: at q = 1, CEU(A) > CEU(D); at q = 0, CEU(D) > CEU(A).  CDT offers oscillation, not guidance.\n\n3. Why mere instability already matters\n\nOne might protest that rationality is a property of *acts*, not of deliberative dynamics; who cares if the machinery jitters so long as the final choice is defensible?  The difficulty is that CDT\u2019s ranking at the moment of action is still undefined, because the final intention that crystallises at t* makes different states more or less probable, thereby altering CEU at t*.  In effect, the theory presupposes the very output it is meant to determine.  A decision rule whose recommendations lack a determinate fixed point cannot serve as a practical guide.\n\nCompare ordinary games against nature.  There, probabilities are data.  Here, probabilities are *functions of the recommended act*.  CDT\u2019s attempt to treat them as data is a category mistake.  The wrongness is structural: the rule takes endogenous variables as exogenous.\n\n4. Dominance violations\n\nArntzenius (2008) sharpened the worry.  Suppose a modest change of payoffs:\n\nUtilities: survive = 0, meet Death = \u20131.\n\nNow the CEU curves as functions of q can be drawn explicitly:\n\n\u2003CEU(D) = \u2013(0.9 + 0.1q)\n\n\u2003CEU(A) = \u20130.9q\n\nPlainly, for *all* q in [0, 1], CEU(A) \u2265 CEU(D); yet whenever q > 0, the agent is more likely to end up in Damascus, so CDT tells her to go to Aleppo, driving q down but never to zero, which flips advice, *et cetera*.  The result: CDT never reaches the dominated act, yet never settles on the dominating act either.  In circumstances in which one act strictly dominates the other, any rule that cannot endorse the dominating option is normatively defective.\n\n5. The epistemic circularity exposed\n\nWhy does CDT stumble here but not in Newcomb\u2019s original problem?  In Newcomb, the accuracy of the predictor is sensitive to *the mere fact* of the choice, but the probabilities of the boxes being full are independent of *how the deliberation proceeds*.  In Death-in-Damascus, by contrast, the relevant probabilities track *the current credence* that the agent will go D or A.  CDT models choice as a one-shot selection from a menu, so it has no conceptual room for probabilities that are updated *inside* the selection process.  The upshot is epistemic circularity:\n\n\u2003To compute CEU(A) one needs P(state | do A).\n\n\u2003But P(state | do A) depends on current P(do A).\n\n\u2003Current P(do A) is itself a function of CEU(A) vs. CEU(B).\n\nThis feedback loop deprives CDT of a stable external vantage point from which to evaluate acts.\n\n6. Ratifiability to the rescue?\n\nOne repair strategy says: \u2018Choose an act that would *ratify* itself\u2014an act such that after you commit, you would have no incentive to switch.\u2019  Formally, pick A only if CEU(A | q*) \u2265 CEU(B | q*), where q* is the probability you assign *conditional on your having already chosen A*.  But because post-commitment probability is 1 for the chosen act, ratifiability pushes the agent to q = 1 or q = 0\u2014precisely the non-ratifiable extremes noted earlier.  Worse, ratifiability inherits another vice: it depends on counterfactuals about what you *would* believe if you had already acted, but those beliefs differ from what you currently believe, so the account licenses akratic policies (preferring an act you now think is worse because you anticipate future cognitive dissonance).\n\nThere is also a deeper point.  Ratification does not *remove* the endogeneity; it simply stipulates that the feedback loop cease at a fixed point.  Yet nothing in CDT\u2019s machinery ensures that a fixed point exists or, if it does, that it is unique or optimal.  In Death-in-Damascus no fixed point exists at all\u2014hence ratification is silent.\n\n7. Deflationary replies and their weakness\n\nReply 1:  \u2018Real agents cannot fine-tune act-probabilities to arbitrary decimals; the instability is an artefact of idealisation.\u2019  \nBut the problem appears whenever Death\u2019s reliability is sufficiently high, however coarse your credal mesh.  All that is required is that deliberation sometimes moves the probability across the point where CEU rankings switch.  Finite grain simply slows the oscillation; it does not cure it.\n\nReply 2:  \u2018Take the limit of deliberation; the probability settles on the mixed strategy that equalises the CEUs, e.g. q = 0.9.  CDT prescribes randomisation with that frequency.\u2019  \nTwo objections.  (i) CDT is an *act* theory, not a *mixed-act* theory; it evaluates concrete options, not probability distributions over them.  (ii) Even if we baptise mixed strategies as acts, the equalising mixture here is dominated: whatever city you visit with the mixed strategy, Death is waiting with 90 % probability, whereas committing to Aleppo guarantees only 81 % risk.  So the \u2018equilibrium mixture\u2019 is worse by CDT\u2019s own lights.\n\nReply 3:  \u2018Treat the agent\u2019s choice mechanism as causally upstream of Death\u2019s prediction; then P(state | do A) is insensitive to small shifts in credence.\u2019  \nThat denies the case description: Death tracks *deliberative intention*, not physical motion.  To save CDT by redefining causal arrows is to concede the theory\u2019s inability to handle the case as stated.\n\n8. A systematic diagnosis\n\nThe root defect is the *act-centralism* that CDT inherits from classical decision theory.  Acts are evaluated one at a time, holding fixed a *background* credence-map over states.  In strategic contexts, however\u2014where the world\u2019s response depends on the entire *policy* you adopt, including its probabilistic contours\u2014treating credences as background is untenable.  CDT\u2019s do-operator severs downstream effects of the act, but cannot sever the epistemic link between its current *probability* and an adversary\u2019s counter-move that is calibrated to that probability.\n\nAn instructive analogy is Nash equilibrium in game theory.  Players reason about how *their strategy choices* alter opponents\u2019 expectations, not merely about how a single pure move fares given static odds.  CDT, in Death-in-Damascus, is like a game-theorist who re-computes best responses at each thought-tick while assuming opponents\u2019 beliefs stay frozen\u2014an assumption known to be false.  No wonder oscillation ensues.\n\n9. Toward a remedy: policy-based causal decision theory\n\nOne diagnostic lesson is that what needs causal evaluation is the *policy* mapping information-states to acts, not the act executed at the end of deliberation.  Formally, let \u03a0 be a function from epistemic states to acts.  Say that Death bases his location on the *output* of \u03a0 applied to your current evidence.  Then construct CEU(\u03a0) = \u03a3s P(s | do \u03a0) U(\u03a0(e), s), where do \u03a0 treats the whole mapping as an intervention variable.  Now a policy such as \u03a0_Aleppo (always go to Aleppo) can be compared to \u03a0_Damascus without any circularity: each policy is a stable object whose selection does not alter the conditional probabilities used to evaluate it (because the probability that *the policy* is chosen is, at the moment of comparison, independent of *which policy* is chosen\u2014exactly the locus where CDT\u2019s earlier step went wrong).\n\nPolicy-CDT straightforwardly recommends \u03a0_Aleppo here: adopting the always-Aleppo rule cuts Death\u2019s hit-rate to 81 % vs. 90 % for \u03a0_Damascus.  More generally, policy-CDT coincides with standard CDT where the world\u2019s response is insensitive to your deliberative credences, and outperforms it where it is sensitive.\n\nThe proposal is modestly revisionary but preserves CDT\u2019s core causal scruple: one conditions only on variables causally independent of the (policy) intervention.  What changes is the level of analysis: from token act to type-level plan.  With that shift, the troublesome dependence on ephemera of deliberation disappears.\n\n10. Broader implications\n\nThe instability highlighted by Death-in-Damascus is not limited to spooky predictors.  Any context in which markets, audiences, or algorithms respond in real time to your evolving intention will infect CDT\u2019s inputs with endogeneity.  High-frequency trading offers a real-world analogy: placing a large buy order moves the market price the moment sophisticated agents infer your intent.  An act-centred CDT will then \u2018chase\u2019 a vanishing optimum, while a policy-centred approach can correctly price the impact of revealing partial intent.\n\nOne might wonder whether moving from acts to policies forfeits some of CDT\u2019s attraction\u2014viz., its fine-grained causal analysis.  Quite the opposite: in interventionist terms, a policy is a *macro-intervention* that realistically captures how agents control their environment.  Perfect predictions by external agents track such macros, not isolated motor outputs.\n\n11. Summing up\n\nYes, CDT\u2019s dependence on the agent\u2019s own act-probabilities in Death-in-Damascus is a serious problem.  It is a problem because:\n\na) It deprives the theory of determinate advice;  \nb) It licences cycles and attends to quantities the agent lacks standing evidence for;  \nc) It can violate dominance;  \nd) Its attempted patch via ratification fails; and  \ne) The malaise is structural, revealing that CDT treats endogenous variables as exogenous.\n\nThe cure is to enlarge the unit of causal evaluation from single acts to policies, thereby restoring exogeneity and securing stable, dominance-respecting recommendations.\n\n12. Coda: what the debate teaches about decision theory\n\nPhilosophers often suppose that the great divide in decision theory is between causal and evidential conceptions of value.  The lesson of Death-in-Damascus is orthogonal: even a causalist must decide *what* to treat as the locus of intervention.  If we pick token acts, endogeneity can wreck the theory; if we pick policies, we regain causal traction.  Whether this upgraded policy-CDT is best described as a variant of CDT or as a new theory is terminological.  What matters is that it avoids the instability that afflicts orthodox CDT\u2014showing that the dependence on act-probabilities was not a benign quirk but a sign of deeper trouble.", "output_tokens": 3981, "reasoning_tokens": 768}

Introduction and thesis\n\nThe \u201cDeath in Damascus\u201d story looks innocent: you must decide whether to go to Damascus or Aleppo, knowing that a more-than-human tracker called Death almost always finds you, basing his hunt on a highly reliable prediction of which city you will choose. Yet, once one writes down the causal decision-theoretic expected utilities, oddities appear. The utilities of Damascus and Aleppo are explicit functions of your current credence that you will pick them. As you deliberate and your credences change, the functions change, and CDT can fling you back and forth\u2014\u201cDamascus looks better \u2026 wait, now Aleppo looks better \u2026\u201d. In this essay I argue that this dependence is a deep problem for classical CDT. It reveals (i) dynamic instability, (ii) a failure to provide action-guidance at the very moment when an agent most needs it, and (iii) a vulnerability to sure-loss betting campaigns. However, I claim the right moral is not to abandon the core causal idea. Rather, we should reformulate CDT so that deliberation aims at a fixed point: a mixed strategy that \u201cratifies\u201d itself, or, equivalently, an equilibrium in a one-person game between the agent and her downstream causal copies. Once CDT is repaired in this way, the embarrassing oscillations disappear\u2014but so do some of its lauded verdicts in other puzzles. The episode therefore teaches a broader lesson: any non-evidential theory must take endogenous probabilities seriously and build them into the choice rule, not leave them dangling as external parameters.\n\n2. The setting\n\nLet S \u2208 {D, A} be the city you end up in, and let \u03b2 be the conditional probability that Death successfully predicts you given your present credence, p, of going to Damascus. The informal story says Death is not perfect but \u201ctends to guess Damascus.\u201d A simple mathematical regimentation is:\n\n\u2022 If you go to Damascus, Pr(Death in Damascus | go D) = 0.8\n\n\u2022 If you go to Aleppo,   Pr(Death in Aleppo  | go A) = 0.6\n\nCrucially, these numbers depend on how predictable you are. If at the start of deliberation you look 70 % likely to head to Damascus, Death\u2019s conditional probability of lying in wait there is higher than if the evidence pointed the other way. In Jeffrey-style CDT one evaluates acts by\n\nEU(a) = \u03a3s Pr(s | do a) \u00b7 U(a, s),\n\nwhere the probabilities are unconditional on a, except for states downstream of the act. Death\u2019s location is not causally downstream\u2014you can\u2019t influence where he is once you choose\u2014so the relevant probabilities are the ones fixed by your current psychological profile. As p slides while you weigh Damascus and Aleppo, so do the expected utilities.\n\n3. Why CDT\u2019s output becomes self-referential\n\nLet UD be the utility of arriving safely in Damascus, U\u00acD the utility if Death awaited, and analogously for Aleppo. Set the bad outcome to 0 and the good to 1 for simplicity. Then\n\nEU(Damascus) = 1 \u00b7 (1 \u2013 0.8) + 0 \u00b7 0.8 = 0.2\n\nEU(Aleppo)   = 1 \u00b7 (1 \u2013 0.6) + 0 \u00b7 0.6 = 0.4\n\nSuppose you begin with p = 0.7. CDT says Aleppo is better (0.4 > 0.2), so rationality pushes you toward Aleppo, thereby lowering p. But if p drops far enough, Death\u2019s conditional success chances in Aleppo rise relative to Damascus; eventually Damascus will look safer and CDT will flip its advice back. A precise model gives a pair of continuous functions EU_D(p) and EU_A(p) that intersect at some interior point p*, the \u201cknife-edge\u201d at which you are indifferent. Unless you happen already to believe with probability p* that you\u2019ll choose Damascus, CDT can move you forever: every deliberative update makes the alternative act strictly better, calling for another update, ad infinitum.\n\n4. Three symptoms of pathology\n\n4.1 Dynamic instability  \nStandard decision theory is meant to be a *procedure*. If following its prescriptions forces an ideal agent into eternal oscillation, the theory fails its most immediate practical task. Mere reference to \u201cmixed strategies\u201d does not solve the problem, because CDT as ordinarily stated offers no rule for where to locate oneself on the probability continuum.\n\n4.2 Action-guidance failure under transparency  \nDeliberation is transparent: while I decide, I can see my own credences shift. CDT therefore presents me with moving goalposts. This violates a basic procedural norm: a decision rule should not, by following it, rob me of the fixed inputs it demanded initially.\n\n4.3 Dutch-book vulnerability  \nA bookmaker who can monitor your vacillations can extract guaranteed profit. Each time CDT makes you favor Damascus, she sells you an Aleppo-death insurance ticket at a premium; when CDT flips, she sells you the converse. Because the vacillation can be turned into an exploitably cyclic preference, classical CDT flunks a money-pump test that most theorists regard as minimal rationality.\n\n5. Comparison with evidential decision theory\n\nOne might suspect the phenomenon is generic: after all, every theory takes an agent\u2019s act probabilities as input. But EDT avoids oscillation in \u201cDeath in Damascus\u201d cases because it conditions on the act itself, not on a hypothetical intervention. Acting on EDT, the agent treats her choice as evidence of where Death is. Since that evidence is *only* available once the choice is resolved, credences about Death\u2019s location need not be updated mid-course. The evaluation is done in an evidentially \u201calready-decided\u201d frame, and so the input probabilities remain fixed. Hence CDT\u2019s problem is not merely that it uses p; rather, it uses p in a way that leaves it hostage to its own deliberative dynamics.\n\n6. Why quick fixes do not work\n\n6.1 \u201cIgnore your changing credences!\u201d  \nOne proposal is to compute expected utilities only with your *prior* act probabilities. But rationality is supposed to be sensitive to what you learn about your own future behaviour; forcing blindness here produces mischief elsewhere. Imagine you discover you are a somnambulist very likely to sleepwalk to Damascus unless you tie yourself up. Should CDT advise against precautions because last night you assigned low probability to sleepwalking? Surely not.\n\n6.2 \u201cPick the act whose value is maximal at p = \u00bd.\u201d  \nThis restores stability in two-act cases but generalises poorly and is unmotivated: nothing justifies privileging \u00bd except desperation. Worse, sophisticated predictors learn that you follow such a rule and adjust.\n\n6.3 Dynamic consistency add-ons  \nSome theorists graft an \u201cEvidential Second Look\u201d onto CDT: first compute causal EUs, then ask whether, conditional on actually taking the act, you would have wanted to ratify it. This collapses into EDT in the relevant range of cases and abandons the original causal insight.\n\n7. A better repair: equilibrium or ratification CDT\n\nThe deeper moral is that *choosing a probability distribution is itself part of the act*. If Death\u2019s disposition tracks your predictability, then you face something like a simultaneous move game between you-now and a counterfactual copy of you fused with Death\u2019s prediction machinery. What you control is a mixed strategy p. The correct decision rule is therefore:\n\nChoose p that maximises expected utility, given that Death best-responds to p by locating where he predicts you will go with his known reliability pattern.\n\nThis system has a unique fixed point: p*. You randomise exactly enough that the causal expected utilities of Damascus and Aleppo equalise; at that point you are indifferent and hence willing to implement the mixture. CDT can be re-written to say \u201cpick a causal-EU best response *over mixed strategies*.\u201d Call the resulting rule Mixed-CDT.\n\nMixed-CDT solves all three pathologies:\n\n\u2022 An input-output map exists and is stationary (no oscillation).  \n\u2022 Deliberation aims at a target p*, so the moving-goalposts problem disappears: once you reach p* the utilities stop shifting.  \n\u2022 Because preferences over lotteries are acyclic, the money-pump collapses.\n\n8. Objections answered\n\n8.1 \u201cRandomisation is irrational if you dislike risk.\u201d  \nRandomising here is not prudentially foolish; it is the only way to reduce Death\u2019s predictive accuracy. The randomness is *instrumental valuable,* not *intrinsically* valuable, so even risk-averse utility functions prefer it.\n\n8.2 \u201cBut agents can\u2019t control their credences.\u201d  \nTrue, you cannot directly will a 37 % credence. But you can adopt behaviour-shaping commitments whose *objective* effect is to implement the mixture: e.g., flip a coin in a public square and go to Damascus on heads. The coin toss is fully under causal control and screens off Death\u2019s prediction.\n\n8.3 \u201cIsn\u2019t this just EDT in disguise?\u201d  \nNo. Mixed-CDT continues to ignore evidential links when evaluating payoffs; it merely internalises that the *probability distribution over acts* is itself up for choice and may have causal spillovers.\n\n9. Implications for other puzzles\n\nThe lesson generalises. In Newcomb\u2019s Problem, standard CDT recommends two-boxing because, *given* an act probability of 1 for two-boxing, the opaque box is already fixed. But if Omega\u2019s prediction accuracy depends on how predictable you are, Mixed-CDT sometimes endorses one-boxing mixed strategies that render you harder to read. Likewise in Parfit\u2019s Hitch-Hiker and in minor variants of Counterfactual Mugging. Thus the reform is not ad hoc; it yields a systematic shift in CDT\u2019s portfolio.\n\n10. Wider philosophical upshot\n\nThe episode reveals a structural oversight in traditional CDT: it neglects the reflexive feature of human agency that one\u2019s epistemic state is itself a causal variable manipulable by higher-order acts (randomisation devices, information-burying, etc.). When the environment reacts to what it can predict about us, we are engaged in what Bas van Fraassen called \u201cgames against nature.\u201d Any adequate decision rule must let the agent choose *how transparent to be*. Classical CDT, by freezing act probabilities exogenously, ignores an entire dimension of control.\n\n11. Conclusion\n\nThe dependence of CDT\u2019s recommendations on the agent\u2019s shifting act probabilities in \u201cDeath in Damascus\u201d is not a superficial nuisance; it signals an internal incoherence. Because classical CDT describes acts as though they were simple categorical choices, yet simultaneously evaluates them via parameters that deliberation itself perturbs, it cannot stably guide action, and it leaves the agent open to exploitation. A principled repair treats the probability distribution over acts as something the agent *decides upon* and insists on a fixed-point (ratifiable) solution. Once CDT is revised in that direction, the oscillation vanishes, the money-pump is blocked, and the theory regains action-guidance without surrendering its causal heart. The broader moral is methodological: decision theories must account for the reflexivity of deliberation. If probabilities are endogenous, they belong on the menu of strategic options, not in the background wallpaper.", "output_tokens": 3151, "reasoning_tokens": 704}

Setting the Stage  \n\nYou are a traveller. Death, who makes shrewd but not infallible predictions of human behaviour, usually guesses that people go to Damascus; his success rate is, say, 80 %. If he predicts that you will go to Damascus, he waits for you there; if he predicts Aleppo, he goes there. You would prefer to avoid him. On Tuesday night you know all this and must decide where to flee on Wednesday morning. Because Death\u2019s prediction is made before you decide, the presence or absence of Death in each city is not causally downstream of your eventual choice. Causal Decision Theory (CDT), in its canonical form, therefore tells you to calculate the expected disutility of each act using unconditional probabilities for Death\u2019s location, conditional only on background facts and causal laws.\n\nHere is the snag. The unconditional probability that Death is in Damascus is sensitive to your *current* probability of performing each act. While you deliberate, those act-probabilities shift. Early in deliberation you may be 70 % confident you will head to Damascus, in which case Damascus looks suicidal and Aleppo looks relatively safe. But once you start to lean toward Aleppo, the correlation flips: Death will now most likely be in Aleppo, so Damascus looks safer again. The CDT recommendation oscillates. Some theorists say this is merely an artefact of stopping deliberation at the wrong moment. Others suspect it betrays a deeper flaw in CDT itself. Which side is right?\n\nI will argue that the dependence on act probabilities *is* a serious problem for orthodox CDT. It reveals three interconnected defects:\n\n(1) Deliberative instability: CDT can fail to reach a stable recommendation even under ideal reflection, violating what many take to be a minimal requirement of a decision rule\u2014that it guide action.  \n(2) Time inconsistency and Dutch-book vulnerability: If one follows CDT through a sequence of small belief revisions, one can be money-pumped in a way that purports to exploit nothing but the CDT agent\u2019s own rational updating.  \n(3) Mislocation of agency: The problem exposes a mismatch between CDT\u2019s algorithm and the causal\u2013explanatory structure it purports to respect, suggesting that the theory confuses evidential with agential probabilities.\n\nAfter developing these three lines, I consider the main CDT defences\u2014ratifiability constraints, mixed acts, and \u201cdecision-end\u201d proposals\u2014and explain why each fails or amounts to abandoning CDT\u2019s core. I end by sketching a more radical repair: separate the *predictive* credence function that models nature\u2019s correlations from the *deliberative* credence function that a rational agent should use in deciding. This yields a form of \u201cupdateless\u201d or policy-level CDT that avoids the oscillation while preserving CDT\u2019s causal scruples. Whether that view is still CDT or a new hybrid is an open question, but the exercise shows just how far one must travel to rescue CDT from the Death in Damascus dilemma.\n\n2. Why the Dependence Matters  \n\n2.1 Deliberative Instability  \n\nStart with the simplest numerical model. Let p be your current subjective probability of choosing Damascus. If Death\u2019s base-rate bias is 0.8 toward predicting Damascus, then conditional on your background information B (including the fact that Death is fairly reliable) you have:\n\nPr(Death in Damascus | B) = 0.8p + 0.2(1 \u2013 p).\n\nYour expected utilities are (normalising survival to 0 and death to \u20131):\n\nEU(Damascus) = \u2013Pr(Death in Damascus)  \nEU(Aleppo)   = \u2013Pr(Death in Aleppo) = \u2013(1 \u2013 Pr(Death in Damascus)).\n\nSo EU(Damascus) < EU(Aleppo) just when Pr(Death in Damascus) > 0.5, i.e. when p > 0.5. But that means:\n\n\u2022 If at any moment you lean > 50 % toward Damascus, EU says \u201cgo to Aleppo.\u201d  \n\u2022 The moment you lean > 50 % toward Aleppo, EU flips and says \u201cgo to Damascus.\u201d\n\nNo matter how finely you slice time, a perfectly rational CDT agent who is even slightly uncertain about what she will do is pushed toward the opposite act. There is no fixed point unless p = 0.5, in which case the EU of both options is equal and the theory is silent. That is deliberative instability: from within the decision process, CDT neither converges nor issues a determinate recommendation.\n\nOne might bite the bullet: maybe rationality sometimes leaves us genuinely torn. But in other contexts CDT\u2019s defenders celebrate its ability to deliver sharp, action-guiding verdicts; the instability seems an unwanted side effect rather than a feature. Moreover, the phenomenon is generic. Any case in which the world\u2019s correlation with your act mimics your prior over the act will yield a similar oscillation. That worries those who expect decision theory to respect a *principle of deliberative closure*: if the background facts and utility values are fixed, ideal reflection should yield a stable prescription.\n\n2.2 Time Inconsistency and Money Pumps  \n\nSuppose you face a bookmaker who understands your CDT psychology. She offers you the following two gambles in immediate succession:\n\nGamble 1 (when your p = 0.7 for Damascus): Pay 1 cent now to receive \\$100 if you go to Aleppo and survive.  \nGamble 2 (after you have accepted 1 and your p flips to 0.3): Pay another 1 cent now to receive \\$100 if you go to Damascus and survive.\n\nEach gamble is CDT-advantageous at the moment it is offered, because at that moment CDT says the referenced destination is the safer one. Accepting both guarantees paying 2 cents and receiving *at most* one \\$100 payout, often none. The bookmaker makes a near-riskless profit by merely tracking your shifting act-probabilities. The resulting *diachronic Dutch book* need not be decisive\u2014infinite regress arguments against Bayesian conditionalisation can be constructed similarly\u2014but it underscores the practical cost of CDT\u2019s oscillation: the theory licenses an exploitable pattern of preference reversals that arise solely from internal reflection, not from new empirical evidence.\n\n2.3 Mislocation of Agency  \n\nFinally, note a conceptual glitch. CDT\u2019s recipe is to hold fixed everything not causally downstream of the act. But your *credence* about what you will do is, in an obvious sense, an epistemic state of your own mind\u2014a product of the very deliberation that CDT is supposed to guide. If one is modelling the causal structure of the world, one should not treat the agent\u2019s momentary credence as an objective chance that nature consults. In Death in Damascus, the physical correlating mechanism is Death\u2019s earlier prediction, not your currently fluctuating belief. By letting your shifting credence feed back into the probability of Death\u2019s location, CDT employs an illegitimate self-reference: it treats a by-product of the deciding process as if it were an exogenous causal variable. That is a category mistake, akin to adjusting the weather forecast whenever you glance at an umbrella.\n\n3. Three CDT Defences and their Limits  \n\n3.1 The Ratifiability Gambit  \n\nJeffrey and others recommend that a rational act must be *ratifiable*: the agent, knowing she is about to perform it, should still prefer it. In Death in Damascus the only ratifiable state, given symmetric utilities, is the 50\u201350 mixture, so the agent should randomise. But while randomisation dissolves instability, it is not cost-free. First, it deprives CDT of a determinate recommendation about *where to go*; the traveller still faces a city in which Death waits. Second, ratifiability is itself an evidential notion. To prefer an act conditional on performing it is precisely the move CDT was designed to avoid. Thus ratifiability repairs CDT by sneaking in evidential reasoning through the back door\u2014an implicit concession that the causal rule alone is inadequate.\n\n3.2 Mixed Acts  \n\nMore sophisticated defenders urge the agent to adopt a *mixed act*\u2014for instance, toss a fair coin and let heads send you to Aleppo. Because Death is better at predicting pure acts than randomised strategies, the mixed act may dominate. But this reply conflates two distinct questions: \u201cWhich *option descriptions* should populate the decision matrix?\u201d and \u201cHow to evaluate each option, granted CDT\u2019s algorithm?\u201d The Death case is designed to test the latter. Invoking mixed strategies simply changes the subject. Moreover, if one permits randomisation, the instability resurfaces at the policy level: the agent\u2019s credence about what mixture she will deploy can itself oscillate.\n\n3.3 Stop Deliberating at the Endpoint  \n\nSome CDT theorists say: \u201cIgnore the intermediate probabilities; rational deliberation terminates only when p reaches 0 or 1, at which point CDT delivers a clear verdict.\u201d Yet ideal Bayesian agents almost never reach probabilities of 0 or 1 by reflection alone. Forcing p to extremal values is tantamount to requiring the agent to *decide* before she has reason to think one act is better\u2014that is, making the end of deliberation logically prior to the preference that is supposed to justify it. The manoeuvre is question-begging; it sets aside the very phenomenon under dispute.\n\n4. A Proposed Repair: Two Levels of Credence  \n\nThe diagnoses above suggest that CDT\u2019s flaw is not its causal orientation but its tacit identification of deliberative probabilities with predictive probabilities. Let us distinguish:\n\nC^D (Deliberative credence): The distribution the agent should use when calculating expected utility for deliberation.  \nC^P (Predictive credence): The agent\u2019s best estimate of nature\u2019s objective correlations, including predictions other observers (like Death) make about her.\n\nIn orthodox CDT, C^D = C^P by fiat. But we can question that identity. Suppose you adopt the following *Policy-Fixing Principle*:\n\n(PFP) When evaluating a policy \u03c0 from a deliberative standpoint, condition on the supposition that you *will* implement \u03c0, but do not update on the merely evidential fact that you are more or less likely to implement \u03c0.\n\nConcretely, imagine choosing between two *policies*: \u201cGo to Damascus\u201d (\u03c0_D) and \u201cGo to Aleppo\u201d (\u03c0_A). To assess \u03c0_D, you ask: *Given that I go to Damascus, what is the probability, according to the causal laws and prior frequencies, that Death will be there?* Crucially, you do *not* let your current wavering confidence in \u03c0_D alter that probability. The relevant probability is fixed by a model in which policy choice is an exogenous node; your present subjective uncertainty about which node you will choose is irrelevant. Formally, one evaluates:\n\nEU(\u03c0) = \u2211_s C^P(s | do(\u03c0)) \u00d7 U(\u03c0,s),\n\nbut where C^P(s | do(\u03c0)) is computed from the graphical causal model with an intervention on the policy node, exactly in Pearl\u2019s sense. Because interventions break incoming arrows, your uncertainty about choosing \u03c0 has no bearing on s.\n\nApplying PFP to Death in Damascus yields a stable recommendation: choose the city with the lower *objective-chance* of Death conditional on the hypothetical *intervention* of choosing that city. If Death is 80 % reliable and biased toward Damascus, then C^P(Death in Damascus | do(Damascus)) = 0.8 while C^P(Death in Damascus | do(Aleppo)) = 0.2, so you go to Aleppo. The instability vanishes because EU no longer tracks your shifting self-prediction.\n\nIs this still CDT? It keeps the causal spirit\u2014probabilities are conditioned only on hypothetical interventions, not on evidential correlations\u2014but it rejects a silent epistemic identification. Some may baptise the view \u201cUpdateless CDT\u201d; others may see it as converging on Functional Decision Theory in recent AI works. Either way, the lesson is clear: to salvage causal decision-making in predictors\u2019 paradoxes, one must insulate the deliberative standpoint from ondulations in self-prediction.\n\n5. Implications and Open Questions  \n\nThe repair raises three intriguing issues.\n\n(1) Reflection principle. Separating C^D and C^P means a fully rational agent can foresee that her predictive credence assigns a different probability distribution to outcomes than the one she will use in choosing. Does this violate Dutch-book rationality? Not if the agent refuses bets premised on predictive odds during deliberation. She operates with two accounting ledgers, each coherent in its own domain.\n\n(2) Learning from internal evidence. Sometimes introspection\u2014realising that one has become stubborn, say\u2014really *is* evidence about the external world. Denying deliberative relevance to that evidence may leave expected-utility money on the table. The boundary between illegitimate self-reference and legitimate self-locating evidence needs further analysis, perhaps along Lewisian lines about de se beliefs.\n\n(3) Multi-agent extensions. In bargaining or game-theoretic contexts, do all players need aligned C^D/C^P separations to avoid instability? If not, predictors could exploit mismatches among agents, suggesting a new research programme on *team-level* causal decision theories.\n\n6. Conclusion  \n\nThe dependence of CDT\u2019s recommendations on the agent\u2019s shifting act-probabilities in Death-in-Damascus cases is not a benign quirk. It undermines the theory\u2019s ability to guide action, exposes it to diachronic money pumps, and rests on a category mistake about the causal status of deliberative credences. Standard patch-ups\u2014ratifiability, mixed acts, endpoint fixation\u2014either trade on evidential reasoning or sweep the instability under the rug. A more principled fix requires acknowledging two layers of probability and constraining deliberation to counterfactual interventions, not to fluctuating self-predictions. Whether that view remains CDT or amounts to a new decision theory, the moral is sobering: any viable causalist theory must explicitly separate *how the world would respond if I did X* from *how likely it is that I will do X*. Conflating the two is a recipe for chasing Death in circles\u2014and, more generally, for decision rules that cannot decide.", "output_tokens": 3511, "reasoning_tokens": 448}

You know that tomorrow he will be in whichever city\u2014Damascus or Aleppo\u2014he predicts you will visit. His predictions are highly but not perfectly reliable, and he has a slight bias toward guessing \u201cDamascus.\u201d Tonight you must decide where to go. According to orthodox causal decision theory (CDT), you evaluate each available act by its causal expected utility: sum, over possible world-states not downstream of your act, of the utility of that act in the state weighted by the unconditional probability of the state. Surprisingly, the value that CDT assigns to \u201cGo to Damascus\u201d turns out to depend on how probable you presently take that act to be. During deliberation you may swing from being 60% confident you will flee to Aleppo to being 40% confident; as that credence slides, CDT\u2019s rankings of the two cities change with it. The result can be an unsettling \u201cdeliberative instability\u201d: at various moments CDT tells you to do whatever you now think you are unlikely to do.\n\nIs this dependence on your current act-probabilities an embarrassment\u2014perhaps even a fatal flaw\u2014for CDT? My answer is \u201cYes, but not for the reason that it involves probabilities of one\u2019s own acts as such.\u201d The real problem is that CDT, as ordinarily stated, treats your credence distribution as an exogenous input even when features of the world you must estimate\u2014including Death\u2019s whereabouts\u2014depend sensitively on the very algorithm you are running to choose. In Death-in-Damascus-style feedback loops, CDT\u2019s insistence on \u201cunconditional\u201d probabilities yields a moving target that undermines its claim to supply rational action guidance. I shall argue:\n\n1. Why act-probability dependence generates genuine decision-making pathologies for CDT in predictor cases.  \n2. Why the standard CDT cures (ratifiability fixes, mixed-strategy fixes, equilibrium fixes) fail to restore adequate guidance.  \n3. How re-formulating CDT at the policy or algorithmic level\u2014what I will call Upstream CDT\u2014avoids the pathology and reveals the deeper moral: rational choice must treat the internal mechanics of deliberation as causally relevant when the world is an accurate mirror of those mechanics.\n\nAlthough the conclusion is critical of textbook CDT, it identifies a way of preserving the causal spirit while avoiding oscillation. The target, then, is not causal decision theory per se, but a particular way of couching it that brackets off the very causal channels that matter when facing reliable predictors.\n\nI. The Formal Source of the Instability\n\nLet the utilities be simple:\n\n\u2022 Survive: 0  \n\u2022 Die: \u20131000\n\nLet \u03c0D be your present probability of going to Damascus, and let \u03b4 be the predictor\u2019s \u201cbias\u201d: other things equal, he guesses Damascus with probability 0.6 and Aleppo with 0.4. Let \u03c1 = 0.9 be the predictor\u2019s reliability.\n\nBecause Death is in whichever city he guesses, the probability Death is in Damascus conditional on your going to Damascus is:\n\nP(Death in D | go-D) = \u03c1 P(predict D | go-D) + (1\u2013\u03c1) P(predict A | go-D).          (1)\n\nBut the predictor\u2019s guess is formed by simulating you. If he thinks you go to Damascus with probability \u03c0D, simple Bayes plus his bias implies\n\nP(predict D) = 0.6\u00b7\u03c0D + 0.4\u00b7(1\u2013\u03c0D).                                              (2)\n\nPlugging (2) into (1), elementary algebra yields\n\nEU(go-D) = \u20131000 \u00d7 [0.9(0.6\u03c0D + 0.4(1\u2013\u03c0D)) + 0.1(1\u20130.6\u03c0D \u2013 0.4(1\u2013\u03c0D))].        (3)\n\nThe key point is qualitative: EU(go-D) is an increasing function of \u03c0D. When you presently regard Damascus as likely, the chance that Death will be there is also high, so the act looks bad; when you waver and start leaning toward Aleppo, equation (3) drives Death\u2019s chance in Damascus down, making Damascus look safer again. The symmetric calculation for Aleppo shows the same mirror image dependence on \u03c0A = 1 \u2013 \u03c0D.\n\nResult: As your credence shifts, CDT\u2019s recommendation can flip\u2014indeed, by transitivity it must flip whenever \u03c0D crosses the unique fixed point where EU(D) = EU(A). Introspective agents who foresee this pendulum can find themselves trapped in an endless loop: at each instant, \u201cfollow CDT!\u201d pushes them toward the act that currently seems safer, only to have that very move raise Death\u2019s likelihood of meeting them there.\n\nII. Why This Is More Than Mild Cognitive Dissonance\n\nA defender might urge that dependence on act-probabilities is not strange. In two-player mixed-strategy games your expected payoff for playing Rock indeed depends on the probability that you will play Rock: if you are committed to 1/3 Rock the payoff is fixed, if you deviate it changes. Yet no one thinks game theory defective for that reason. So why worry here?\n\nThe answer is threefold.\n\n1. Lack of a Stable Recommendation. In ordinary mixed-strategy contexts, a rational agent selects the probability distribution that is a best response to itself (a Nash equilibrium). CDT, by contrast, provides no inbuilt mechanism for locating such a fixed point; worse, no guarantee exists that one will coincide with the act it recommends. The theory hands you a recipe that, when followed naively, never settles.\n\n2. Guidance Failure at the Personal Level. Decision theory is an instrument of practical deliberation. If faithfully executing CDT in real time issues in perpetual vacillation, then it fails its instrumental purpose. A principle that, when consulted, predictably pushes you into cycles cannot be the final word on rational action. (Contrast: expected-utility maximization under ordinary uncertainty does not do that.)\n\n3. Dutch Book Vulnerability. Consider a bookie who, at every oscillation, offers you small bets favouring your then-preferred city. Because you flip an unbounded number of times before dawn, the bookie can lock in a sure loss no matter which city you land in. So CDT, executed naively, exposes your credences to domination.\n\nFor these reasons, the mere fact that payoffs depend on mixed strategies is not a knock-down defence. CDT\u2019s implementation gap is more severe because, unlike classical game theory, it refuses to treat one\u2019s own deliberative state as a player in the game.\n\nIII. Standard Repairs and Why They Fall Short\n\n(i) Ratificationism. Jeffrey and Harper suggested that a rational act should \u201cratify\u201d itself: choose A only if, conditional on choosing A, A still looks best. In Death in Damascus, though, both acts ratify\u2014if I treat \u03c0D as fixed at 1, then EU(D) < EU(A), so choosing Aleppo ratifies; but analogously Aleppo ratifies itself when \u03c0D = 0. An extension that searches for globally stable \u03c0D runs into indeterminacy or recommends the 50/50 mixed strategy. Yet the 50/50 mix does strictly worse in expectation than certain alternative dispositions (e.g., a hard-wired \u201cAlways Aleppo\u201d can outperform it given Death\u2019s Damascus bias).\n\n(ii) Mixed-Act CDT. Some propose that the object of evaluation should be a probability distribution over acts, not the individual act taken. On that view the agent chooses the \u03c0D that maximizes expected utility, finds the best mixed strategy, and then randomizes accordingly. Unfortunately, to implement the very \u03c0D picked one must ensure the predictor learns precisely that distribution; any deviation, even due to quantum noise in the randomizer, re-opens the instability. Worse, ordinary humans are bad at sampling true randomness, so the prescription is practically self-defeating.\n\n(iii) Equilibrium Fix. Gibbard and Harper\u2019s \u201cequilibrium\u201d CDT stipulates that your credences and act must jointly be a fixed point. Technically elegant, this move purchases stability by definition, not explanation. Why should rationality require you to hold the specific credence at which CDT ceases to oscillate rather than some other equally coherent credence function? The theory provides no further argument beyond brute self-consistency, so the alleged cure merely re-describes the symptom.\n\n(iv) Stick-to-Your-Guns Pragmatism. Stalnaker once remarked that you invoke CDT only \u201cat the end of deliberation,\u201d after your credences have settled. The recipe then outputs a single act and you proceed. But nothing in the orthodox axioms explains which credences count as \u201csettled\u201d or why the settling should happen at the unique fixed point rather than wherever introspection finds itself. Absent an account of the causal process, the advice is effectively: \u201cStop oscillating\u2014when you are done oscillating.\u201d\n\nIV. Diagnosing the Deeper Malaise\n\nWhat ties these failed repairs together is a common oversight. They preserve the letter of CDT\u2019s prohibition on using evidential correlations as reasons to act, yet they try to patch the evident leak by tinkering with the output stage. The real trouble lies upstream: the \u201cunconditional probabilities\u201d that CDT instructs us to feed into the causal expected-utility formula are not, in predictor cases, independent of the algorithm that picks the act. We are, in effect, asked to estimate P(Death in Damascus) while pretending our estimation procedure and Death\u2019s prediction algorithm are causally divorced, even though we know both spring from the same source code. The feedback loop thereby introduced is not solved by fiddling with ratification criteria; it calls for reconceiving which nodes count as \u201ccausally downstream.\u201d\n\nHere is a suggestive analogy. In Newcomb\u2019s Problem, CDT\u2019s causal model declares the opaque box\u2019s content fixed, hence (it claims) my choice cannot causally influence that content. Yet one may convincingly protest that the predictor\u2019s simulation of my very deliberation constitutes a causal pathway\u2014not through future-to-past spooky action, but through information about my algorithm picked up earlier. Something parallel operates in Death in Damascus: my probability distribution over acts is part of the causal nexus whereby Death positions himself. If CDT\u2019s decision graph omits that arrow, no wonder the expected utilities bob up and down whenever my credence does.\n\nV. Upstream CDT: Incorporating the Deliberation Algorithm\n\nSuppose we enrich the causal model to include a node A, representing the abstract algorithm (or policy) I am committed to implement, and a node P, representing the predictor\u2019s output. P is causally downstream of A because the predictor simulates that very algorithm; my concrete act a tomorrow is, in turn, downstream of both A and a particular seed of random noise n (if the algorithm is stochastic). Death\u2019s location D is a deterministic function of P. Finally, my utility U depends on a and D.\n\nOnce the act-selecting algorithm A appears explicitly in the graph, the instruction \u201cevaluate expected utility using unconditional probabilities for nodes not downstream of the act\u201d yields a very different result. The states upstream of a include P and hence D. Their probabilities depend on A but not on the particular branch of randomization that realizes a. Consequently:\n\n1. The expected utility of adopting algorithm A is well-defined and does not vary as I introspect about which output branch I will take, because those branches lie downstream of the predictor\u2019s guess.  \n2. Oscillation disappears. The algorithm either deterministically points to Damascus, deterministically to Aleppo, or randomizes with a certain \u03c0. Each policy has a fixed expected utility independent of second-by-second vacillation.  \n3. In the canonical parameter setting (predictor 90% reliable and biased toward Damascus), the highest-utility algorithm is \u201cAlways Aleppo.\u201d The agent who embodies it calmly heads north while Death, more often than not, gets it wrong. CDT at the policy level thereby recovers the intuitive winner.\n\nBy shifting one rung \u201cupstream\u201d in the causal chain, we preserve CDT\u2019s core doctrine\u2014choose actions (or now, policies) by causally expected utility\u2014while avoiding dependence on unstable subjective probabilities. The agent\u2019s credence that *she will in fact go to Aleppo* may still flicker during contemplation, but those flickers no longer feed into the evaluation of the policy because the relevant upstream probabilities were set the moment she adopted the policy. In this reconception, only changes to the policy/node A, not moment-by-moment v\u00e1ltoz\u00e1sok in self-prediction, are decision-relevant.\n\nVI. Objections and Replies\n\nObjection 1: \u201cPolicy\u201d selection is spuriously grand. Rational agents are rarely able to bind themselves to a unique algorithm; real deliberation happens one choice at a time.  \nReply: Binding is not required. What matters is which causal factors the agent takes herself to control. If the world copies your algorithm, you control which algorithm that is, even if you cannot control its specific stochastic outcome. CDT already assumes agents can choose between acts; extending the choice to the algorithm that *generates* the acts is merely recognising an earlier node in the same causal chain.\n\nObjection 2: Upstream CDT smuggles in evidential reasoning through the back door. Isn\u2019t the agent now taking advantage of the correlation between A and P?  \nReply: The correlation is acknowledged because it is *causal*: the predictor\u2019s access to the agent\u2019s source code is a physical channel. CDT forbids treating mere evidential correlations as decision-relevant; it does not forbid exploiting genuine causal pathways previously overlooked because of an impoverished model. Adding the arrow from A to P respects the causal scruples.\n\nObjection 3: The cure generalises too far. In simple choice problems with no predictor, policy evaluation collapses to ordinary act evaluation; but in ordinary games against nature, nobody needs this machinery.  \nReply: Correct. Upstream CDT is strictly conservative: in worlds where no upstream copy of the algorithm exists, the additional node is causally inert and the recommendations coincide with standard CDT. The new model matters precisely in opaque-box or predictor situations. A good decision theory should be extensionally equivalent to CDT in ordinary cases and diverge only where CDT\u2019s guidance misfires. Upstream CDT does just that.\n\nVII. Broader Lessons\n\nThe Death-in-Damascus puzzle exposes a fault line between two conceptions of rational choice:\n\nA. The Snapshot View: At the instant of action, I treat my contemplated choices as the only causal levers and hold fixed my entire epistemic state.  \nB. The Algorithmic View: Rational control reaches one layer deeper, to the policy that will determine (perhaps stochastically) my behaviour in all superficially similar situations.\n\nSnapshot CDT implements A; Upstream CDT represents B. Predictor cases show the snapshot to be causally incomplete. Once we enlarge the grain of analysis, act-probability dependence ceases to be alarming because my fluctuating second-order beliefs are not the right input for the causal expectation calculus.\n\nIn other words, the pathology is not that utilities depend on \u03c0D; any sophisticated agent in a game-theoretic environment should expect that. The pathology is that orthodox CDT asks us to plug into its formula a quantity (the unconditional probability of Death\u2019s location) that is in fact conditional on our still-in-flux deliberative state. Upstream CDT repairs that by regressing the causal cut one step and thereby stabilises the deliberative loop.\n\nVIII. Conclusion\n\nDoes the dependence of CDT\u2019s recommendations on one\u2019s current act-probabilities constitute a problem for the theory? Yes\u2014but the problem is not bare dependence. It is that orthodox CDT, by ignoring the causal influence of one\u2019s own decision algorithm on predictor-informed states of the world, allows that dependence to swing uncontrolled during deliberation, depriving the agent of coherent guidance. Standard patches\u2014ratification, mixed strategies, fixed-point stipulations\u2014either fail to stop the oscillation in practice or buy stability at the cost of unargued stipulation. A more principled fix is to relocate the locus of choice upstream to the policy. When we do, CDT\u2019s core causal insight is preserved, its deliverances stabilise, and the Death-in-Damascus conundrum dissolves: rational agents confidently adopt whatever algorithm maximises expected survival given how their algorithms are read by the world. In the familiar parameter settings that means taking the road to Aleppo and leaving Death puzzled in Damascus.\n\nIn sum, Death\u2019s shadow reveals not that causal decision theory is wrong to care about causes rather than mere evidential correlations, but that its canonical articulation underestimates how far causal influence can reach when the world contains faithful mirrors of our deliberations. Recognising that reach restores CDT\u2019s power and shows that the true measure of rational agency is control of one\u2019s algorithm, not nervous monitoring of one\u2019s immediate urges.", "output_tokens": 4486, "reasoning_tokens": 960}

The case is simple enough to recount in a paragraph, yet rich enough to expose a structural feature of CDT that has received surprisingly little sustained analysis: CDT\u2019s expected\u2010utility calculation for an act A explicitly includes the agent\u2019s own present credence that she will perform A.  In ordinary cases that dependence is harmless (indeed, invisible), because the world state relevant to payoffs is normally independent of the agent\u2019s idle probabilities about what she will do.  In Death-in-Damascus cases, however, an imperfect but highly reliable predictor uses exactly those probabilities\u2014and nothing else\u2014to decide where to wait.  As the agent deliberates, her probabilities shift, and the prediction shifts with them.  CDT\u2019s recommendation therefore \u201cchases\u201d a moving target.  The result is an advice loop that never settles into a fixed point.  Is that merely an exotic curiosity, or does it reveal a genuine flaw in CDT?\n\nI shall argue for the stronger verdict: the dependence on act probabilities is a deep problem for orthodox CDT.  It turns CDT from a normative principle into a mirage whenever (i) an outcome-relevant state of the world tracks the agent\u2019s evolving uncertainty about her own act and (ii) the agent knows this fact and therefore rationally updates those probabilities in the very course of deliberation.  The instability is not just frustrating; it undermines CDT\u2019s claim to be action-guiding, violates the Reflection Principle, and leaves the theory vulnerable to Dutch-book and money-pump arguments.  After clarifying the mechanics of the instability (\u00a71), I turn to an attempted rescue that treats one\u2019s act probabilities as exogenous \u201cbackground\u201d beliefs (\u00a72).  I then explain why that proposal fails and why the most promising escape routes require abandoning a core commitment of traditional CDT (\u00a73).  I close by sketching two alternative frameworks\u2014ratificationist CDT and so-called Functional Decision Theory\u2014that dissolve the instability by assigning probabilities to policies rather than to momentary acts (\u00a74).\n\n1.  How the dependence generates instability\n\nStart with a precise toy model.  You value survival at 100 utiles and death at 0.  You may travel tonight to Aleppo (A) or Damascus (D).  Death has a crystal ball whose accuracy is 90 %: he predicts the city you will choose and goes there.  You also know that, for some inscrutable psychological reason, the predictor has a bias toward Damascus: when his crystal ball is cloudy, he says \u201cDamascus.\u201d  Formally,\n\nP(Death\u2019s prediction = your act) = 0.9  \nP(Death forecasts D | crystal ball cloudy) = 1.\n\nLet p be your current subjective probability that you will choose Aleppo.  Because Death\u2019s presence in a city equals his prediction, and that prediction covaries with p, the causal decision theorist representing you calculates the expected utility of going to Aleppo as\n\nEU(A) = 100 \u00b7 P(survive | A) = 100 \u00b7 [1 \u2013 P(Death in Aleppo | A)]  \nEU(D) = 100 \u00b7 [1 \u2013 P(Death in Damascus | D)].\n\nBy the independence rule at the heart of CDT, you evaluate only unconditional probabilities for states not downstream of your act.  Whether Death is in Aleppo or Damascus is not caused by your act (you are deciding after the prediction has been made), so CDT instructs you to treat P(Death in Aleppo) and P(Death in Damascus) as they stand now\u2014probabilities that depend on p.\n\nThe algebra is transparent.  Death is in Aleppo iff he predicts Aleppo.  So\n\nP(Death in Aleppo) = P(predicts A) = 0.9p + 0.1\u00b70  = 0.9p  \nP(Death in Damascus) = 1 \u2013 0.9p.\n\nThus\n\nEU(A) = 100(1 \u2013 0.9p)  \nEU(D) = 100\u00b70.9p.\n\nCDT says \u201cChoose the act with higher EU.\u201d  If p < \u00bd, EU(A) > EU(D) and you should go to Aleppo; if p > \u00bd, you should go to Damascus.  But notice: the boundary point \u00bd is identical to the rule\u2019s recommendation.  If you start with p = 0.6\u2014i.e., you find yourself leaning a bit toward Aleppo\u2014the recipe tells you to go to Damascus, which would instantly drive p to (essentially) 0.  That flip restores the condition p < \u00bd, which in turn recommends Aleppo.  The system ping-pongs.\n\nThere is no fixed point except the knife-edge p = \u00bd, where the agent feels exactly indifferent between the two cities.  But such indifference is fragile: a flicker of self-doubt re-initiates the oscillation.  A rule that yields well-defined advice only under a perfectly balanced prior credence\u2014and whose advice destabilizes that balance whenever it is heeded\u2014is not a rule that can give usable guidance to finite, introspectively aware deliberators.\n\nWhy is that a philosophical problem rather than merely a psychological annoyance?  Three interlocking deficiencies follow.\n\na)  Action-guidance.  A decision rule earns its keep by telling an agent what to do, not merely what she would wish to do if she could freeze her own credences while deliberating.  CDT\u2019s prescription in Death cases fails that minimal pragmatist test.\n\nb)  Violating Reflection.  Van Fraassen\u2019s Reflection Principle holds that if at time t you expect that your future credence in a proposition will be q, and you trust your future self, you should already assign credence q now.  CDT impels you to adopt a plan you believe will immediately force you to alter your credence\u2014and thereby the plan itself.  The theory repeatedly counsels you to become someone you do not presently endorse.  That is a diachronic incoherence.\n\nc)  Exploitability.  The classic symptom of incoherent probabilities is Dutch-book vulnerability.  In an expanded Death scenario one can construct betting schemes that siphon sure loss from the CDT agent as her credences rock back and forth.  More intuitively: a savvy predictor can sell \u201cinsurance\u201d priced each time she flips, reaping arbitrage from the fact that her probability assignments cannot stably track her own behaviour.\n\n2.  Treating act probabilities as exogenous: a failed repair\n\nA natural response is to declare that the p entering the expected-utility calculus is fixed at the start of deliberation: \u201cTake your current mixed strategy as given; then act as the argmax against that backdrop.\u201d  On that construal the dependence on p is static, and CDT issues a determinate recommendation.  If you start with p = 0.6, EU(A) < EU(D); so you determinately go to Damascus after all.  Case closed.\n\nNot so fast.  Two objections:\n\nFirst, the rule misidentifies the time at which the decision problem is faced.  At the moment you commit to an act\u2014perhaps five minutes after the first glimmer of deliberation\u2014you know that p \u2248 1 for that act.  The exogenous-p rule therefore collapses into recommending Damascus (because Death\u2019s bias already made p_Damascus > \u00bd) for anyone who ends up there, and Aleppo for anyone who ends up in Aleppo.  The recommendation is ex post tautological.\n\nSecond, and more fundamentally, freezing p contradicts the informational dynamics of rational deliberation.  Discovering that EU(A) < EU(D) is evidence about what you will in fact do; ignoring that evidence violates Bayesian conditioning.  A theory that requires you to compartmentalize relevant information in order to follow its advice is self-undermining.  (Notice how unlike the ordinary \u201cdeliberation crowds out prediction\u201d point this is: here it is precisely the predictive link that matters.)\n\n3.  Why orthodox CDT cannot escape\n\nThe dependence problem is rooted in CDT\u2019s insistence that (i) the value of an act be computed conditional on the act, but (ii) all probabilities for states not caused by that act remain unconditional.  In Death cases, the combination is explosive because the predictor has made the world state highly sensitive to the agent\u2019s credence.  The only way to stop the explosion is to relax at least one of those two commitments.\n\nCould we retain (ii) but weaken (i), evaluating whole policies instead of momentary acts?  That is Jeffrey\u2019s ratificationism: choose an act only if you will still prefer having chosen it upon learning that very fact.  The ratification test looks for a fixed point by embedding the act within a self-referential loop of preference and prediction.  In the Death case there is still no ratifiable pure act; but one can show that a 50/50 mixed strategy is ratifiable.  That is progress\u2014yet it comes at the price of abandoning CDT\u2019s clean causal modularity.  Ratification glues together decision and prediction; the \u201ccausal\u201d in CDT has faded.\n\nAlternatively, keep (i) and reject (ii).  That is the route taken by \u201cpolicy-based CDT\u201d (Gibbard-Harper) and by Functional Decision Theory (FDT, Yudkowsky/Soares).  The idea is that, although your instantaneous choice cannot causally influence where Death is, the algorithm you instantiate is logically correlated with Death\u2019s earlier prediction.  Therefore you should compute expected utility conditional on the output of that algorithm.  Formally, replace the unconditional probability P(Death in Aleppo) with P(Death in Aleppo | output = \u2018Aleppo\u2019).  Because the algorithm\u2019s output is the same random variable that the predictor consulted, the conditional collapses the uncertainty: P(Death in Aleppo | output = \u2018Aleppo\u2019) \u2248 0.9.  But crucially\u2014and here is the payoff\u2014the figure no longer depends on your subjective credence during deliberation.  The fixed-point instability disappears.  FDT thus recovers action-guidance: it tells you to go to Aleppo irrespective of your wavering p, because that is the act correlated with survival.\n\nWhat should we conclude?  You can keep CDT\u2019s formalism only by inserting an epicycle (exogenous p) that conflicts with Bayesian updating, or by re-engineering CDT into a policy-conditioned theory that is CDT in name only.  Either way, the original dependence on act probabilities is revealed as untenable.\n\n4.  Two stable replacements\n\nBecause space is limited I sketch rather than defend in detail two approaches that avoid the pathology.\n\n4.1  Ratificationist CDT\n\nGibbard and Harper proposed that an act is rational iff, having discovered that you will do it, you would still prefer that act.  Formally, A is ratifiable if EU(A | will A) \u2265 EU(B | will A) for every alternative B.  In the Death case, neither pure act is ratifiable, but the mixed 50/50 strategy is.  Critics complain that ratifiability can recommend randomization even when stakes are symmetrical, but defenders reply that the central desideratum\u2014stability under self\u2010prediction\u2014is achieved.\n\n4.2  Functional Decision Theory\n\nFDT conditions on the output of the agent\u2019s decision function, not on the physical act.  In Death cases the function\u2019s output is the variable Death predicts, so conditioning wipes out the dependence on degrees of belief.  FDT cleanly prescribes Aleppo, the city with only a 10 % chance of harboring Death given the agent\u2019s algorithm.  The theory thereby treats logical correlation on par with causal influence, a move foreign to classical CDT but arguably in line with the instrumental core of expected\u2010utility reasoning.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe dependence of CDT\u2019s verdict on the agent\u2019s shifting act probabilities is not an innocuous quirk; it cripples CDT\u2019s ability to guide action in any scenario where outcome\u2010relevant states track those probabilities.  Attempts to cordon off the problem by fixing the probabilities in advance are ad hoc and conflict with Bayesian learning.  To regain stability one must abandon at least one of CDT\u2019s defining tenets, either by ratifying whole policies or by broadening the conditioning base to include logical correlations.  In short, the Death in Damascus reveals that orthodox CDT is hostage to a self\u2010referential feedback loop of its own making.  A decision theory fit for agents who know they are predictable must break that loop, even at the cost of radical revision.", "output_tokens": 3385, "reasoning_tokens": 704}

Introduction and Thesis  \n\nCausal Decision Theory (CDT) tells us to maximize expected utility calculated with probabilities that treat the act itself as causally downstream of nothing and therefore held fixed.  In ordinary cases the resulting recommendation is insensitive to how confident you are that you will carry it out, because the utilities of the non-act states do not vary with that confidence.  In \u201cDeath in Damascus\u2019\u2019 (DiD)\u2013style problems, however, the very utilities you assign to \u201cgo to Aleppo\u2019\u2019 and \u201cgo to Damascus\u2019\u2019 depend on your present subjective probabilities of performing those acts.  As you deliberate and those probabilities shift, CDT\u2019s verdict shifts with them.  My thesis is that this sensitivity is a serious defect in standard CDT.  It shows that CDT, so formulated, lacks (i) deliberative stability, (ii) action-guidance, and (iii) diachronic rationality.  The defect is not merely cosmetic; it stems from CDT\u2019s way of carving up the decision problem and can be repaired only by reconceiving the unit of agency (for example, by moving to policy-selection or updateless decision rules).  \n\nI develop the argument in five stages.\n\n1.  Reconstructing the DiD game and the feedback loop.  \n2.  Explaining how CDT\u2019s expected-utility calculations inherit that loop.  \n3.  Showing three ways the loop violates core decision-theoretic desiderata.  \n4.  Assessing two attempted repairs internal to CDT (ratifiability and mixed strategies) and showing why they fail.  \n5.  Sketching an external repair that diagnoses the deeper problem, thereby illuminating the limitations of CDT\u2019s causal-conditioning schema.\n\nThroughout, the guiding idea is that a decision theory must not merely pick an option at an instant; it must license a self-reflective agent to settle on an option in full view of its own deliberation.  CDT, in the DiD setting, cannot do that.\n\nII. Reconstructing Death in Damascus  \n\nThe original vignette (due to Gibbard & Harper) admits many parameter choices.  Let:  \n\n\u2022  U(survive the day) = 1, U(die) = 0.  \n\u2022  Death\u2019s prediction reliability r = 0.9.  \n\u2022  Death has a mild bias toward Damascus: before predicting he flips a fair coin; on heads he predicts \u201cDamascus\u2019\u2019 no matter what, on tails he tries (with reliability r) to predict your eventual destination.  \n\nLet P(A) and P(D)=1\u2013P(A) be your current subjective probabilities of ultimately going to Aleppo or Damascus.  Standard CDT directs you to compute:\n\nEU(Aleppo) = P(Death predicted Damascus | go to A)\u00b71 + P(Death predicted Aleppo | go to A)\u00b70  \nEU(Damascus) = P(Death predicted Aleppo | go to D)\u00b71 + P(Death predicted Damascus | go to D)\u00b70.\n\nBecause death\u2019s prediction partially tracks your action, those conditional probabilities depend on P(A).  Elementary algebra yields\n\nEU(A) = (\u00bd) + (\u00bd)(1\u2013r)\u00b7P(A)  \nEU(D) = (\u00bd)(1\u2013r) + (\u00bd)\u00b7P(A).\n\nSubstituting r = .9 gives\n\nEU(A) = .5 + .05\u00b7P(A)  \nEU(D) = .05 + .5\u00b7P(A).\n\nHence:\n\n\u2022  If P(A) > .5, then EU(D) > EU(A); you ought to head for Damascus.  \n\u2022  If P(A) < .5, then EU(A) > EU(D); you ought to head for Aleppo.  \n\u2022  If P(A)=.5, they tie.\n\nSo whichever city you presently regard as likelier to visit, CDT tells you to switch to the other.  Once you switch, of course, your act-probabilities flip, reversing the recommendation.  CDT therefore issues no stable verdict.  We have a feedback loop:\n\nbelieve-A \u21d2 choose-D \u21d2 believe-D \u21d2 choose-A \u21d2 \u2026 ad infinitum.\n\nIII. Why the Feedback is Trouble  \n\n(1) Guidance Failure  \n\nA decision theory should be action-guiding: a deliberating agent should be able to consult the theory and emerge with a conclusion.  CDT\u2019s shifting verdict in DiD makes that impossible.  The agent who is perfectly self-reflective will anticipate that any concluded intention will immediately become more probable, overturning the very calculation that grounded it.  The only fixed points are mixed strategies that the theory never instructs the agent to adopt, because at no stage in the cycling does CDT rank a mix higher than a pure move.\n\nContrast: Evidential Decision Theory (EDT) gives the stable advice \u201cstay in Damascus\u2019\u2019; Functional Decision Theory (FDT) says \u201cgo to Aleppo.\u2019\u2019  Whatever one thinks of those answers, they do not degenerate into oscillation.  CDT fails the basic criterion of delivering an answer in the first place.\n\n(2) Diachronic Incoherence  \n\nSuppose you are equipped with a causal decision-theoretic planning module updated continuously during deliberation.  Because CDT\u2019s advice oscillates, you are guaranteed to change intentions an unbounded number of times in any interval with no new evidence.  This violates a weak form of dynamic consistency: you can foresee right now that tomorrow you will regard today\u2019s intention as ex ante sub-optimal even though the informational state will be unchanged.  Standard Dutch Book theorems show that such predictable shifts allow a bookmaker to extract guaranteed losses from you via time-indexed bets conditional on your future behavior.  So the instability is not merely psychological but money-pumpable.\n\n(3) Ratifiability Constraint  \n\nJeffrey (1983) suggested that rational acts should be \u201cratifiable\u2019\u2019: once you take into account the fact that you have decided on them, they should still maximize expected utility.  CDT\u2019s recommendations in DiD are unratifiable by design, because the fact that you decide for Aleppo raises P(A) and thereby lowers EU(A).  A theory that routinely recommends unrati\ufb01able actions is, at best, incomplete.  Ratification might not be a categorical requirement, but CDT gives no story why unrati\ufb01ability is benign here.\n\nIV. Two Internal Repairs Considered  \n\nA. Ratifiability Restriction  \n\nOne might bolt a ratifiability filter onto CDT: from among the CDT-approved acts, retain only those that would still be optimal conditional on performing them.  In DiD that leaves none unless P(A)=.5.  The filter therefore issues \u201cstay undecided\u2019\u2019\u2014an impossible command.  Worse, other familiar cases (e.g., toxicology problems) force the filter to select dominated options.  Hence adding ratifiability inside CDT collapses into paralysis or irrationality.\n\nB. Mixed Strategies  \n\nA second idea is to allow the agent to randomize with probability p so as to hit the fixed point p=.5, since at that mixture EU(A)=EU(D).  That breaks the oscillation.  But CDT has no resources for ranking mixed acts except by the same expectation formula that created the problem.  At p=.5, any \u03b5-shift again makes one pure act strictly better, so the mixture is knife-edge unstable.  In game-theoretic terms, p=.5 is not a trembling-hand perfect equilibrium because arbitrarily small uncertainty restores the oscillation.  Moreover, CDT as ordinarily stated treats probabilities of acts as epistemic, not as intentional mixtures under the agent\u2019s control; adding deliberate randomization is therefore an ad hoc expander of the action space and requires a further principle (maximin? maximum entropy?) to select the correct p in general.\n\nHence neither internal patch yields a satisfying decision rule.\n\nV. The Deeper Diagnosis  \n\nWhy does CDT stumble here while EDT and updateless variants do not?  Because CDT insistently conditions on the *act token* as a causal intervention, holding fixed the very variable whose probability is endogenous to deliberation.  In problems where others predict you by simulating your decision process, the causal arrow from act to outcome is mediated by *the decision function*, not by the time-slice act itself.  CDT\u2019s template\u2014sum over probability of world-state given act\u2014mislocates the cut between agent and environment.  The decision function you implement is part of the causal network that Death observes; yet CDT treats it as exogenous and thereby fails to reckon with the fact that changing your probabilities changes the world.\n\nFunctional Decision Theory and policy-selection variants of CDT avoid that error.  They treat the unit of choice as the function mapping informational states to actions.  You then maximize expected utility with respect to the distribution over worlds conditional on your *being such a function*.  In DiD, the function \u201calways go to Aleppo\u2019\u2019 causally screens off Death\u2019s tendency to predict Damascus, giving high survival probability; \u201calways go to Damascus\u2019\u2019 yields low survival; the mixed function with p=.5 does no better.  The oscillation never gets started because probabilities of city-visits are outputs, not inputs, to the evaluation.\n\nVI. Objections and Replies  \n\nObjection 1: \u201cReal agents do not know their act-probabilities; so the oscillation is a philosopher\u2019s artifact.\u2019\u2019  \nReply: The phenomenon appears as soon as the agent is even vaguely aware of a correlation between act and predictor.  Minor shifts in credence suffice.  Moreover, rationality criteria should not depend on limitations of introspection; a theory that breaks down if the agent does become self-aware is defective.\n\nObjection 2: \u201cCDT can stipulate that probabilities of acts are held fixed during deliberation\u2014treat them as \u2018screened-off\u2019 variables.\u2019\u2019  \nReply: That begs the question.  If the agent believes her own act is contingent, she cannot *coherently* regard its probability as fixed while simultaneously trying to decide.  Telling her to pretend otherwise evacuates CDT of usefulness precisely when reflective intelligence matters.\n\nObjection 3: \u201cThe instability is akin to the familiar fact that game-theory sometimes lacks pure-strategy equilibria; decision theory should live with that.\u2019\u2019  \nReply: In game situations we indeed expect mixed-strategy equilibria, but a single-agent decision problem should not replicate the strategic indeterminacy that arises when multiple independent utility maximizers interact.  When it does, that is evidence we have mis-modeled the causal structure and imported a ghost opponent (here, a simulation of ourselves) into the environment.\n\nVII. Conclusion and Moral  \n\nThe dependence of CDT\u2019s verdict on the agent\u2019s shifting act-probabilities in Death in Damascus is not a quirky corner case but a symptom of a conceptual limitation.  It robs CDT of deliberative stability, violates ratifiability, and enables predictable diachronic preference reversals that a savvy bookmaker can exploit.  Internal repairs either paralyze the agent or smuggle in new decision principles.  The right lesson is that when predictors or copies of ourselves interact with us, the unit of agency expands from momentary acts to whole decision functions.  CDT, tied to act-conditioning, misplaces the cut and so generates a self-undermining feedback loop.  To recover a workable decision theory we must adopt a framework\u2014functional, updateless, or policy-based\u2014that evaluates options in a way insensitive to the real-time flux of one\u2019s own act-probabilities.  The problem is thus real and reveals something deep: causal decision theory, in its standard form, is an incomplete blueprint for rational choice in a world that can see inside our heads.", "output_tokens": 3034, "reasoning_tokens": 576}

Setting the Stage  \n\nImagine that at dawn you learn three things.  \n(a) Death is waiting for you today in one of two cities, Aleppo or Damascus.  \n(b) He has already tried to predict which of the two you will visit. If he guessed right, he will be there when you arrive and you die; if he guessed wrong, you live.  \n(c) Death\u2019s crystal ball is good but not perfect: with 90 % reliability it foresees your eventual choice, and when it errs it does so by guessing Damascus rather than Aleppo four times out of five.  \nYou can now choose: stay in Damascus or flee to Aleppo.  \n\nThis is a variant of \u201cDeath in Damascus.\u201d The detail that Death is biased toward guessing Damascus simply makes explicit what the informal story suggests: he is slightly lazy and, all else equal, prefers to stay where he is.  \n\nCausal Decision Theory (CDT) instructs you to evaluate each act\u2014going to Aleppo, staying in Damascus\u2014by its expected utility computed with \u201ccausal\u201d probabilities: for any factor not downstream of your act you use your present unconditional credence in it, not your credence conditional on performing the act. When Death\u2019s prediction is outside your causal influence, the probability that Death is in a given city depends on how likely you currently deem it that you will head there. That dependence makes the expected utility of each act a function of your current self-anticipation, Pr(Aleppo) and Pr(Damascus). As those probabilities shift during deliberation, CDT\u2019s recommendation can flip back and forth. Is that a real defect in the theory or merely a curiosity? I shall argue that it is a serious problem, because (i) it induces dynamic instability that undermines effective deliberation, (ii) it violates a plausible independence constraint on rational choice, and (iii) it points to a deeper structural flaw about how CDT models the causal relevance of an agent\u2019s own decision process. I close by examining classical replies\u2014mixed strategies, ratifiability, and \u201cprobabilities before deliberation\u201d\u2014and showing why they do not fully rescue standard CDT, though they gesture toward more radical reforms such as updateless or functional decision theories.\n\n2. How the Dependence Arises  \n\nLet p be your present credence that you will end up in Aleppo when deliberation is over. Because Death\u2019s crystal ball has 90 % reliability and a Damascus-favoring bias, the unconditional probability that Death is currently in Aleppo is\n\nPr(Death in A) = 0.9 p + 0.1 (1\u2013p) \u00d7 0.2 = 0.9 p + 0.02 (1\u2013p).  \n(The first term is the chance he predicts correctly; the second is the chance he predicts wrongly, multiplied by the 20 % probability that a wrong guess points to Aleppo.)\n\nThe chance he is in Damascus is 1 \u2013 that. If dying carries utility \u2013100 and surviving 0, the causal expected utilities of the two acts are\n\nEU(Aleppo) = \u2013100 \u00d7 Pr(Death in A)  \nEU(Damascus) = \u2013100 \u00d7 Pr(Death in D).\n\nBecause the prefactor \u2013100 is the same, we can focus on the probabilities themselves:\n\nEU(A) > EU(D)  \u21d4  Pr(Death in A) < Pr(Death in D).\n\nAlgebra shows that inequality holds just in case p < 0.2. If at the moment you regard the chance you will go to Aleppo as lower than 20 %, CDT tells you to go to Aleppo. But as soon as you begin to move your credence in that direction\u2014\u201cPerhaps I really should flee\u201d\u2014p rises. Cross the 0.2 threshold and the recommendation reverses: now you should stay in Damascus. Recognizing that, you lower p again, and the pendulum swings back. In effect, CDT supplies no action-stable guidance; any infinitesimal adjustment of self-belief can invert the prescription.\n\n3. Why Instability Matters  \n\nA decision theory is meant to be a practical guide for situated agents. Guidance that is not stable under competent reflective deliberation fails its purpose. The worry here is not simply that CDT\u2019s output is sensitive to second-order facts (my beliefs about what I will do). Many perfectly sound deliberations are sensitive in that way. The complaint is sharper: CDT generates a feedback loop in which the very act of responding rationally to the recommendation predictably destroys its validity. No convergence point exists unless the relevant parameters happen to line up exactly with a knife-edge fixed point (p = 0.2 in our toy numbers). But knife-edge equilibria are measure-zero events; they cannot be relied on.\n\nDynamic instability undermines two desiderata of practical rationality:\n\nGuidance: The theory should leave a conscientious agent with something she can stably do.  \n\nTrust in Deliberation: Rational reflection should not systematically make things worse by eroding the basis of one\u2019s own reasoning.\n\nCDT in Death-type cases violates both. That alone is strong prima facie evidence of a defect.\n\n4. Independence from Self-Referential Credences  \n\nA second way to see the trouble is to notice that considerations about how probable I currently take an action to be seem normatively irrelevant. Suppose just before I open the door I learn that an alien mathematician has assigned an arbitrary real number between 0 and 1 to \u201cthe probability the human will go to Aleppo.\u201d Does that make the mortal stakes of Aleppo any higher or lower? Surely not. Yet CDT effectively allows such \u201cprobabilities\u201d\u2014even when they arise endogenously from my own shifting sentiments\u2014to do decisive causal work. That smells of an independence violation: rational choice should not turn on evidentially inert, introspectively labile second-order beliefs.\n\nThe comparison with the widely accepted independence of irrelevant alternatives is apt. Here the irrelevant item is not an alternative act but a doxastic state: what I happen to think about my propensity to act. By letting that intrude, CDT contravenes the spirit (if not the letter) of the independence norm.\n\n5. A Structural Diagnosis  \n\nWhy does CDT stumble? The root lies in the way it combines two commitments:\n\nCausal Sufficiency: Only factors causally downstream of the act are \u201cscreened off.\u201d  \n\nSynchronic Evaluation: Probabilities are assessed at the very moment of choice, using the agent\u2019s current unconditional credence.\n\nWhen the predictor\u2019s judgment depends on the same internal deliberative process that produces the act, those two commitments pull apart. The predictor\u2019s location is causally upstream of the bodily motion (you cannot affect where Death now is), yet it is logically correlated with your decision procedure. By evaluating at the moment in which the decision procedure is still unresolved and using unconditional credences that reflect that very uncertainty, CDT delivers a moving target. In cases where predictor accuracy is high but imperfect, the target is not only moving; it is dynamically repulsive\u2014tiny self-updates push one away from equilibrium.\n\nThis diagnosis suggests why proposals that merely tweak numbers or introduce randomization cannot fully fix things: they leave intact the synchronic causal-probability recipe that makes expected utility depend on the oscillator p.\n\n6. Classical Escapes and Why They Fall Short  \n\n6.1 Mixed Strategies  \n\nOne can introduce deliberate randomization: decide to go to Aleppo with probability exactly 0.2 and Damascus otherwise. At p = 0.2 the expected utilities tie; CDT is then indifferent, and the instability vanishes. But in ordinary practical contexts humans do not wield entropy sources precise enough to generate objective 0.2 randomness; more importantly, aiming for exactly p = 0.2 presupposes that one already knows how the predictor\u2019s bias and reliability cash out to three significant digits. In many realistic cases one lacks that information. So the remedy is fragile and in any case concedes the main point: CDT must move from pure acts to lottery recommendations, a form of \u201cpolicy mixing\u201d its original statement was designed to avoid.\n\n6.2 Ratifiability  \n\nJeffrey suggested that a rational act must be \u201cratifiable\u201d: it should still look optimal upon learning that one will perform it. Formally, A is ratifiable if EU(A | \u2018I shall do A\u2019) \u2265 EU(B | \u2018I shall do A\u2019) for every alternative B. Ratifiability plugs the instability by forbidding recommendations that would undermine themselves. Unfortunately, it throws out many intuitively sensible choices. In a simple Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma with a low but nonzero chance of mutual cooperation, defection is not ratifiable; yet defection is what every mainstream decision theory prescribes. Jeffrey famously concluded that ideal agents must sometimes be \u201cincorrigibly uncertain\u201d about what they will do, which is tantamount to denying that they can ever settle conviction about their own act. That is a high price to pay for patching a flaw that arises only in predictor cases.\n\n6.3 Fixing Probabilities at the Start  \n\nAnother proposal: compute expected utilities with the unconditional probabilities you had at the *outset* of deliberation, before you started manipulating p. Then the recommendation no longer bounces around. But deliberation is partly an information-gathering process: as you think, you learn things about your character, resolve ambiguities, notice salient considerations. A theory that freezes probabilities at an ex ante snapshot implicitly forbids you to use hard-won self-knowledge. That again seems unacceptably restrictive as a general prescription.\n\nMoreover, if you announce in advance that you will freeze probabilities no matter how your opinion evolves, a sophisticated predictor like Death will take that policy into account. You have merely displaced the correlation problem to an earlier time slice, not eliminated it.\n\n7. Toward Deeper Remedies  \n\nPhilosophers sympathetic to functional or updateless decision theories take the instability as evidence that CDT is tracking the wrong causal structure. What matters is not the bodily motion of walking to Aleppo but the abstract algorithm by which you settle that question\u2014the same algorithm the predictor tries to simulate. Evaluation should therefore apply to *policies* or *computations* considered as abstract objects. On such accounts, you one-box in Newcomb\u2019s Problem and stay in Damascus here, not because your motion reaches Death but because your decision function\u2019s output is subjunctively linked to what Death predicted. Whether one endorses such radical reconstruals, it is worth noting that they eliminate the oscillatory dependence on p; the expected utility of a policy is fixed prior to and independent of the policy\u2019s local probability of being executed at one instant.\n\nA milder possible repair is \u201ctwo-stage CDT.\u201d Stage 1: pick a *probabilistic policy* (e.g., \u2018choose Aleppo with 0.2\u2019) by maximizing expected utility using prior credences about how predictors respond to whole mixed policies. Stage 2: implement that lottery. This variant inherits the attractive stability of the first stage while retaining a recognizably causal spirit. But its departure from classical CDT is substantive: the locus of evaluation moves from individual acts to probability distributions over them, and the background probability measure is fixed before the second-stage randomness rolls. In effect, two-stage CDT collapses into a form of updateless evaluation.\n\n8. Comparative Note: EDT and the Symmetry of Instability  \n\nIs the problem unique to CDT? Superficially EDT also makes expected utilities a function of Pr(Aleppo), because the probability that Death is in Aleppo given that you go there is close to 0.9. However, in Death-style cases EDT usually recommends Damascus and (unlike CDT) its recommendation is *stable*. Why? Because EDT conditions on the act under evaluation, so its expected utility functions are pulled to near extreme values\u2014there is negligible region in which EU(A) crosses EU(D). The instability thus reflects a specific interaction between CDT\u2019s use of unconditional credences and the moderate (not near-perfect) reliability of the predictor. In that sense the defect is indeed distinctive of CDT.\n\n9. Summary of the Case Against Dependence  \n\nWe can now summarize why CDT\u2019s dependence on act probabilities is a genuine problem, not a merely technical quirk:\n\n1. Dynamic instability: The recommendation predictably undermines itself, leaving conscientious agents with no convergent directive.  \n2. Independence violation: Rational choice should not hinge on introspectively contingent second-order beliefs about one\u2019s own propensity.  \n3. Structural mismatch: CDT treats the predictor\u2019s location as causally insulated from the act, ignoring the common source in the deliberative algorithm.  \n4. Inadequacy of patches: Standard fixes (randomization, ratifiability, probability-freezing) either fail in typical cases or impose objectionable restrictions, confirming that the issue is deep-seated.\n\n10. Conclusion  \n\nDeath in Damascus exposes a fracture line in orthodox CDT. Where an observer exploits correlations between your decision process and an outcome outside your causal control, CDT lets your flickering self-confidence feed back into the very utilities it asks you to maximize. The resulting guidance is unstable, normatively unpersuasive, and hard to square with decision theory\u2019s practical aims. Attempts to save CDT by ad hoc modifications illuminate the source of the difficulty but do not remove it. The moral is that a satisfactory theory of rational choice must evaluate policies or decision functions in a way that is robust under endogenous shifts in self-assessment. Whether one travels the path of ratifiability, two-stage choice, or the more radical route of functional decision theory, the journey begins with recognizing that CDT\u2019s dependence on act probabilities in Death-type scenarios is not a harmless curiosity but a symptom of a deeper conceptual lesion.", "output_tokens": 3822, "reasoning_tokens": 960}

Introduction and Thesis\n\nSuppose, like the traveller in the \u201cDeath in Damascus\u201d fable, you know two things: (i) Death is 90 % reliable at predicting which of two cities you will visit tomorrow, and he will wait for you in the city he predicts; (ii) when Death is uncertain he has a mild predictive bias toward Damascus. Tonight you must decide where to go. A textbook application of Causal Decision Theory (CDT) instructs you to calculate, for each act, its causal expected utility: the utility you expect conditional on performing that act, holding fixed unconditional probabilities for states of the world not causally downstream of your act. But in this set-up the probability that Death is in Damascus is exactly the probability that you will go to Damascus\u2014hence the very number you are trying to determine in the course of deliberation. As your credence in \u201cI shall go to Damascus\u201d shifts, the causal expected utility of going to Damascus shifts with it, and CDT\u2019s recommendation can oscillate back and forth. The specter of an \u201cunstable\u201d deliberation\u2014one that never settles or that settles arbitrarily\u2014has led many philosophers to wonder whether CDT harbours a hidden flaw.\n\nMy thesis is two-part.\n\nA. Yes: CDT\u2019s dependence on the agent\u2019s current act-probabilities is a genuine problem, because it makes the theory normatively self-undermining. When the value a theory assigns to an option fluctuates solely in virtue of the agent\u2019s fleeting shades of credence about which option she will pick, the theory cannot offer action-guiding advice that the agent can coherently follow. In the Death in Damascus family of cases CDT collapses into a game of \u201cguess what you will guess\u201d, and that is no way to steer rational action.\n\nB. The deeper source of the problem is CDT\u2019s insistence on evaluating acts using unconditional probabilities for states it deems \u201ccausally independent\u201d. In Newcombish situations\u2014including Death in Damascus\u2014the predictor\u2019s state is not, from the agent\u2019s functional point of view, causally independent. The agent\u2019s algorithm and the predictor\u2019s algorithm are coupled. Once we recognise this, either (i) we must revise CDT so that it treats the predictor\u2019s act as downstream of the decision process (e.g. by adopting Functional Decision Theory or some fixed-point decision rule), or (ii) we must supplement CDT with a ratifiability constraint that severs the fatal feedback loop between credence and recommendation. Unmodified CDT therefore fails, but a corrected version shows how to preserve CDT\u2019s core causal scruples without the instability.\n\nThe argument proceeds in five steps: (2) a careful diagnosis of CDT\u2019s calculations; (3) proof that the resulting deliberative dynamics are unstable; (4) rebuttal of two lines of defence; (5) articulation of two repairs and their implications; and (6) conclusion.\n\n2. How CDT Computes in Death in Damascus\n\nLet U(city) be the utility of ending up in a given city alive; let \u2212M be the disutility of meeting Death (M for \u201cmortality\u201d). For simplicity set U(Aleppo)=U(Damascus)=0, and \u2212M=\u2212100. Let p be your present credence that you will go to Damascus; by the story, your credence that Death is in Damascus is\n\nPr(Death in D) = 0.9\u00b7p + 0.1\u00b7b,\n\nwhere b>0.5 captures the bias toward predicting Damascus if Death is unsure. For concreteness take b=0.6, so Pr(Death in D) = 0.9p + 0.06.\n\nCDT tells you to evaluate each act using these unconditional probabilities:\n\nEU(Damascus) = 0\u00b7(1\u2212Pr(Death in D)) + (\u2212100)\u00b7Pr(Death in D) = \u2212100(0.9p+0.06).\n\nEU(Aleppo)\u2003= \u2212100(1\u2212Pr(Death in D)) = \u2212100(1\u22120.9p\u22120.06) = \u2212100(0.94\u22120.9p).\n\nObserve that EU(Damascus) is decreasing in p, whereas EU(Aleppo) is increasing in p. Solve for the indifference point:\n\nEU(Damascus) = EU(Aleppo) \u21d2 \u22120.9p\u22120.06 = \u22120.94+0.9p \u21d2 p* = 0.44.\n\nTherefore:\n\n\u2022 If p > 0.44, EU(Damascus) < EU(Aleppo): CDT says \u201cGo to Aleppo.\u201d\n\u2022 If p < 0.44, CDT says \u201cGo to Damascus.\u201d\n\nThe expected utilities cross exactly at the credence 0.44. Nothing seems amiss until we remember that p is not fixed by the world; it is fixed by you while you deliberate. By merely raising your credence that you will go to Damascus across the 0.44 threshold you flip CDT\u2019s verdict, which in turn should instantaneously lower your credence, which in turn flips the verdict back, ad infinitum. CDT has produced a non-convergent deliberation.\n\n3. Why the Deliberative Dynamics Are Pathological\n\nRational deliberation is supposed to guide action by a stable procedure: start with evidence, weigh options, and settle on the act with maximal expected utility. CDT\u2019s dependence on p breaks this picture in three ways.\n\na) Self-Referential Instability. The theory assigns value to an act partly in virtue of the agent\u2019s instantaneous estimate of that very act\u2019s probability. That is a feedback loop: change the estimate, change the value, change the estimate\u2026 In dynamical-systems language the fixed point p* = 0.44 is repelling, not attracting; small perturbations cause runaway oscillation. A decision rule that lacks an attracting fixed point offers no coherent advice.\n\nb) Violation of \u201cDeliberation Crowds Out Prediction.\u201d A platitude of practical reasoning is that assenting to \u201cI shall \u03a6\u201d is the terminus of deliberation, not its object. CDT turns the attitude \u201cI assign 0.6 to my \u03a6-ing\u201d into evidence about the world to be folded back into the utility calculus. That collapses the methodological divide between choosing and predicting, leaving the agent entangled in self-prediction rather than decision.\n\nc) No Action-Guidance. Imagine trying to implement CDT minute by minute. At t\u2080 your p=0.3; CDT says \u201cDamascus,\u201d so you resolve to go to Damascus, thereby updating to p=0.8; at t\u2081 CDT now says \u201cAleppo,\u201d so you flip; update; flip\u2026 You either never act or you act arbitrarily when the taxi driver demands an answer. A normative theory whose literal application prevents rational action is, to that extent, defective.\n\n4. Two Failed Lines of Defence\n\n4.1 \u201cThis Is Just Subjective Uncertainty; Live With It.\u201d\n\nOne might say: \u201cAll theories depend on subjective probabilities. If your probabilities oscillate, so will any expected-utility calculation. CDT is no worse off.\u201d The reply is that CDT\u2019s oscillation is not driven by ordinary evidential learning but by bootstrapping on your own shifting intention, which is under voluntary control. Compare: If new meteorological data makes me revise the chance of rain upward, everyone agrees the expected utility of carrying an umbrella should rise. That is healthy sensitivity to evidence. In the Damascus case, however, the only \u2018evidence\u2019 that flips the calculation is my fleeting self-belief. That is pathological self-reference, not healthy responsiveness.\n\n4.2 \u201cFreeze p at the Start (or the End) of Deliberation.\u201d\n\nA second proposal is to legislate that p be treated as exogenous\u2014e.g. its initial value when one begins deliberating, or its limit as deliberation concludes. But which? Any such freeze is arbitrary, delivers different recommendations for infinitesimally different freeze-times, and worse, violates the principle that rational belief is sensitive to available information. The moment one notices that one is, say, firm in intending Damascus, one\u2019s best unconditional probability for \u201cDeath waits in Damascus\u201d must update. Freezing p is equivalent to instructing the agent to ignore her own intentions even when she becomes certain of them\u2014hardly decent epistemic advice.\n\n5. Two Positive Repairs\n\nRecognising the failure of pure CDT, philosophers have pursued two strategies: ratifiability and algorithmic causation. Each can tame the instability, but they do so by amending CDT\u2019s causal vision.\n\n5.1 Ratifiability: Fixed-Point Expected Utility\n\nJeffrey and Skyrms proposed that a rational act must be ratifiable: it must maximize expected utility under the assumption that one will perform it. Formally, choose \u03a6 only if EU(\u03a6 | deliberation concludes with \u03a6) \u2265 EU(\u03a8 | deliberation concludes with \u03a6) for all \u03a8. In Death in Damascus the ratifiability condition eliminates oscillation, because only the mixed strategy \u201cchoose Damascus with probability 0.44\u201d is ratifiable. The agent can approximate that by, say, tossing a biased coin. Ratifiability therefore selects a stable solution.\n\nHowever, adopting ratifiability means abandoning CDT\u2019s use of unconditional probabilities. The EU in the ratifiability test is conditional on the decision outcome, hence computed with different probability measures for different candidate acts. That is in effect a tilt toward Evidential Decision Theory. Additionally, ratifiability delivers indeterminate advice in many ordinary cases (both \u201cbuy the car\u201d and \u201cdon\u2019t buy\u201d can be ratifiable), so it does not integrate smoothly with everyday CDT practice.\n\n5.2 Functional Decision Theory and Algorithmic Dependence\n\nA more radical correction is to revise the causal model. From the perspective of the agent\u2019s decision algorithm, the predictor\u2019s output is not causally independent: both outputs are functions of the same input (the traveller\u2019s decision-procedure). On this view, the correct causal graph places a common-cause node linking \u201cmy decision output\u201d and \u201cDeath\u2019s location.\u201d Once that link is acknowledged, the probability that Death is in Damascus conditional on \u201cI go to Damascus\u201d becomes ~0.9 or 1, not the unconditional 0.9p+0.06. CDT, applied to the right model, now advises \u201cstay away from where the predictor believes you will go,\u201d which, given that you control the choice, points to Aleppo with probability one. Functional Decision Theory (FDT) and Updateless Decision Theory (UDT) work along these lines and navigate Death in Damascus without instability.\n\nThis fix preserves the causal spirit\u2014only genuine causal independencies license probability \u201csurgery\u201d\u2014but insists that logical or algorithmic dependencies can ground a causal connection in the relevant sense. Advocates argue that CDT\u2019s instability is diagnostic evidence that it omits such dependencies; once we add them, the act-probabilities drop out of the computation, and the oscillation vanishes.\n\n6. Wider Implications and Conclusion\n\nThe Death in Damascus pathology is not an exotic edge case. Any scenario where a sophisticated predictor correlates her move with yours (Newcomb, Transparent Newcomb, Counterfactual Mugging, many bargaining games) will threaten similar feedback loops if a decision rule severs the correlation at evaluation time but leaves it alive at meta-deliberative time. CDT\u2019s dependence on act-probabilities is thus symptomatic of a mismatch between how the theory draws causal boundaries and how real-world predictors couple to us.\n\nTo recapitulate:\n\n1. CDT says: evaluate acts using unconditional probabilities for predictor states.\n2. In Death in Damascus, those probabilities are p-dependent, where p itself is set by deliberation.\n3. That dependence makes CDT\u2019s recommendation unstable; no fixed point exists except at delicate knife-edge mixtures.\n4. Instability undermines the theory\u2019s capacity to guide action and violates basic norms of deliberation.\n5. Patch-up attempts that simply freeze p or shrug at the oscillation fail.\n6. Serious repairs revise CDT either by (a) adding a ratifiability constraint that replaces unconditional with conditional probabilities, or (b) enlarging the causal model to treat predictive correlations as causal links. Both fixes abandon a central plank of old-school CDT.\n\nTherefore the dependence on act-probabilities is indeed a problem for CDT: it reveals an internal inconsistency between the theory\u2019s epistemology (how probabilities are assigned) and its decision rule (how utilities are computed), forcing us either to reshape CDT or to replace it with a successor theory that respects the causal entanglement between our decisions and the world\u2019s predictions of them. The traveller who wants stable, action-guiding counsel had better look elsewhere\u2014or upgrade CDT so that Death\u2019s scythe no longer lurks in the loops of self-prediction.", "output_tokens": 3109, "reasoning_tokens": 384}

What she sees through that window may change as she gathers new information, but once all the strictly factual evidence is in, her probabilities about the external world should stop oscillating merely because she is engaging in further reflection.  In Skyrms\u2019s memorable phrase, deliberation ought to be \u201ca biological process, not a metaphysical one\u201d: it should produce a decision, not amplify\u2010feedback in the epistemic representation of the decision itself.  Standard Causal Decision Theory (CDT), however, can turn that sensible ideal on its head in \u201cself\u2010reference\u201d cases such as Death in Damascus.  Because its expected-utility formula conditions on the unconditional probability of states that are not causally downstream of the act, CDT makes the expected utility of each available act a function of the agent\u2019s current credence that she will perform that very act.  As those act\u2010probabilities shift during ordinary deliberation, CDT can flip its prescription back and forth, producing an unstable, potentially indefinitely cycling decision procedure.\n\nMy thesis is that this dependence on act probabilities is indeed a deep problem for orthodox CDT\u2014not a mere technical embarrassment.  It violates a desideratum I will call deliberative invariance, undermines diachronic coherence, and exposes CDT agents to prudent-bet money pumps.  The phenomenon shows that CDT\u2019s epistemic severing of acts from their upstream correlates is too crude once the agent herself is known to be predictable.  The instability is not cured merely by counseling the agent to \u201cplay mixed strategies\u201d or by insisting that the credence in one\u2019s future act be treated as exogenous.  Rather, the pathology points toward a need for a more global or updateless perspective on choice\u2014one that evaluates whole policies (or decision algorithms) rather than choice moments treated in isolation.\n\nI proceed in five steps.  (1) I rehearse the Death in Damascus case and derive the CDT equations that generate the dependence.  (2) I articulate the normative ideal of deliberative invariance and show how CDT violates it.  (3) I exhibit a money-pump that turns the CDT oscillation into guaranteed loss, thereby connecting the epistemic instability to practical irrationality.  (4) I consider two well\u2010known \u201cfixes\u201d for CDT\u2014deliberation equilibria and the appeal to causal mixed strategies\u2014and argue that they either smuggle in an evidential perspective or else merely postpone the difficulty.  (5) I sketch a policy-level alternative that preserves CDT\u2019s causal scruples while avoiding the reflexive incoherence.\n\n1.  How CDT Gets Entangled with Its Own Probabilities  \n\nVersions of the Death in Damascus story vary, but the following template is enough.  Death is an excellent, albeit not perfect, predictor of your movements.  If he predicts you will go to Damascus, he awaits you there tomorrow; otherwise he goes to Aleppo.  You care solely about staying alive.  You know that Death\u2019s reliability is, say, 80 %.  You also know he has a mild bias toward predicting Damascus: ceteris paribus, if he is unsure, he guesses Damascus.  At t\u2080 you must decide whether to flee to Aleppo or remain in Damascus.\n\nLet A be the act of going to Aleppo, D the act of staying in Damascus.  \nLet AD be the state \u2018Death is in Aleppo\u2019, DD \u2018Death is in Damascus\u2019.  \nLet P(AD|A) = 0.20 and P(AD|D) = 0.80, matching Death\u2019s reliability.  Importantly, these conditional probabilities still depend on the agent\u2019s credence that she will perform A or D, since Death\u2019s bias is keyed to that credence.  To model that, let x = P(A), the agent\u2019s current subjective probability that she will go to Aleppo.  Given the bias, suppose Death adopts a prior of 0.6 that you go to Damascus, modulates that by his reliability, and you incorporate that via Bayes.  One convenient representation is:\n\nP(DD) = 0.6\u00b70.8 + 0.4\u00b70.2 = 0.56 if P(A) \u2248 0.4, etc.\n\nHowever we fill in the numbers, the crucial fact is that P(DD) is a continuous function of x, and hence the expected utilities EDT would compute:\n\nEU(A) = P(AD|A)\u00b71 + P(DD|A)\u00b70 = P(AD|A)  \nEU(D) = P(DD|D)\u00b70 + P(AD|D)\u00b71 = P(AD|D)\n\nare each functions of x.  CDT, by contrast, insists on stripping away the evidential correlation between act and predictor.  It uses the unconditional probabilities of AD and DD\u2014that is, it insists on treating Death\u2019s location as probabilistically independent of your act.  But those unconditional probabilities were themselves derived from your earlier degree of confidence that you will do A versus D.  Hence:\n\nEU\u1d04\u1d05\u1d1b(A) = P(AD)\u00b71 + P(DD)\u00b70 = P(AD)  \nEU\u1d04\u1d05\u1d1b(D) = P(DD)\u00b70 + P(AD)\u00b71 = P(DD)\n\nwith P(AD) = 1 \u2212 P(DD) = f(x).  As the meta-level credence x wobbles in the course of deliberation, f(x) wobbles, and CDT\u2019s max-EU recommendation can alternate between A and D.\n\n2.  The Normative Ideal of Deliberative Invariance  \n\nBy deliberative invariance I mean: once a rational agent has fixed all the ordinary empirical probabilities, the advice of decision theory should not depend on fleeting variations in her self-locating probability about which act she will finally perform.  The advice is supposed to *determine* which act she shall do; it should not *depend on* her moment-by-moment credence about that determination in progress.  Compare: a calculator\u2019s answer to 547\u00d723 should not constantly change as it computes; only the final settled output matters.\n\nTo dramatize CDT\u2019s violation of invariance, suppose the agent begins with a hazy 50 / 50 credence about her eventual act, so x = 0.5.  At that credence CDT tells her to go to Aleppo, because with x = 0.5 Death is more likely to expect Damascus, making Aleppo safer.  But as she starts forming the intention to head for Aleppo, x drifts upward toward 1.  Once x crosses a threshold (in this toy model, 0.6), the unconditional probability that Death is in Aleppo now exceeds 0.5, switching the safer city to Damascus.  The agent, tracking CDT\u2019s prescription, reverses course; x drifts back down; CDT flips again; ad infinitum.\n\nThe problem is not merely that the agent deliberates longer than necessary.  The oscillation can fail to converge, because the only fixed point is where x equals the mixed-strategy equilibrium (here, 0.6): a state in which the agent\u2019s future act is genuinely randomised.  But CDT never advises *choosing* that mixed strategy; it is reached, if at all, only as the accidental limit of pathological vacillation.  As Skyrms noted, a decision theory that tells you to intend whatever you currently assign lower probability to intending is self-defeating.\n\n3.  A Money-Pump Against the CDT Vacillator  \n\nSuppose an enterprising bookmaker overhears the CDT agent musing aloud, and can instantly offer small, fair bets on whether the agent will go to Aleppo.  At each oscillation the agent\u2019s credence about A shifts (say) from 0.55 to 0.65.  Just before it rises she is willing to sell a $1 lottery ticket that pays $1 if she goes to Aleppo for 55 cents; just after the flip she buys it back for 65 cents.  Net loss: 10 cents.  Because CDT provides no internal mechanism to halt the cycle, the bookmaker can pump an arbitrary amount of money out of the agent before t\u2080, at which point the agent ends up in exactly the mixed state she would have reached for free had she chosen it initially.  This shows that the CDT dynamics are not merely psychologically awkward but expose the agent to sure loss given only fair odds.  That is ordinarily taken as a mark of irrationality.\n\nNotice that the bookie\u2019s exploit presupposes no violation of causal principles.  She is not influencing Death; she is exploiting the fact that CDT agents treat their own developing intentions as negotiable pieces of probabilistic information.  A rational update rule should not generate buy-high-sell-low cycles in full view of the agent.\n\n4.  Two Popular Repairs, and Why They Do Not Save CDT Proper  \n\n4.1  Deliberation Equilibria  \n\nSkyrms\u2019s proposal is to locate *equilibria* of the deliberation dynamics: mixed strategies x* at which CDT\u2019s advice stops flipping.  The idea is that the rational act is to randomise with probability x*, i.e. to adopt the policy \u201cdraw a private Bernoulli variate with parameter x*; if heads go to Aleppo, tails to Damascus.\u201d  At x* the unconditional probability of Death\u2019s location exactly balances the expected utilities so that neither pure act is strictly better.\n\nYet the equilibrium fix tacitly abandons a central CDT commitment: that what matters is the causal impact of *acts* considered one at a time.  Mixing is a way of *correlating* your eventual move with external states by exploiting the predictor\u2019s imperfect accuracy.  But correlation is precisely what CDT was designed to ignore; it treats the external state as probabilistically independent of your act.  Introducing equilibrium mixing, therefore, covertly smuggles in an evidential perspective: the agent chooses a *policy* because she expects the choice of that policy to be informative about Death\u2019s location.\n\nMoreover, the set of equilibria can be unhelpfully large or empty, and the selection problem re-emerges at the policy level.  So while the move is ingenious, it is not a mere patch inside CDT; it amounts to a partial retreat toward an evidential or updateless vantage.\n\n4.2  Causal Mixed Strategies  \n\nJoyce and others have replied that CDT, properly understood, can evaluate *mixed strategies causally*: the probability that Death is in Damascus is conditionally independent not of the pure act but of the *randomisation device*, which is causally upstream of both pure acts.  Therefore, once the agent adopts a coin-flip policy with parameter x, the unconditional P(DD) no longer depends on her \u201csettled-on\u201d pure act, and the oscillation is dissolved.\n\nThis proposal, however, has teeth only because the randomiser is stipulated to be causally prior to Death\u2019s prediction.  If the random coin toss occurs after Death has already set out, it makes no causal difference to his location.  But the way the case is set up, Death decides before the agent.  So either we require agents to install upstream randomisers in advance of every choice in which they might later be predicted\u2014a demand bordering on foresight of all practical dilemmas\u2014or we still face the original problem.\n\nMore fundamentally, once we let the agent evaluate lotteries over her own pure acts, *the same mixed act probability x re-enters the CDT calculation*: EU\u1d04\u1d05\u1d1b(A-mix) = x\u00b7P(AD|A) + (1 \u2212 x)\u00b7P(AD|D).  If Death is a sufficiently competent interpreter, he will treat the choice of lottery as evidence about the probability distribution of acts, and the regress restarts.  This is a shell game, not a cure.\n\n5.  Toward a Policy-Level Causal Theory  \n\nWhat emerges from the foregoing is that CDT\u2019s instability is a symptom of a deeper limitation: it treats decision nodes as *temporally and epistemically local*, ignoring the fact that in predictable\u2010agent problems the act\u2019s very *decision procedure* leaks information upstream.  Once that leakage is recognised, we need a theory that evaluates whole *policies*\u2014specifications of what the agent will do in every informational situation\u2014without conditioning on the policy\u2019s local output.  The guiding idea is \u201cupdatelessness\u201d: decide ex ante, behind the veil of later self-prediction, which strategy maximises expected causal value given only the objectively open causal forks.\n\nIn the Death in Damascus scenario, an updateless causal agent would solve:\n\nMaximise over policies \u03c0: {always-Aleppo, always-Damascus, Bernoulli(x)\u2026}  \nEU(\u03c0) = \u03a3_s P(s | \u03c0 causes) \u00b7 U(\u03c0(s), s)\n\nwhere P(s | \u03c0 causes) is computed holding fixed the policy as a *whole*, not the act that a particular branch of \u03c0 outputs.  Because Death predicts by simulating your entire policy, the unconditional probabilities in the sum are genuinely fixed\u2014they do not wobble with the human in-the-moment credence that she will do A vs D.  On plausible numbers, the always-Aleppo policy beats the always-Damascus policy once the predictor\u2019s Damascus bias is factored in; and *that verdict stays fixed throughout deliberation*, satisfying deliberative invariance.  Crucially, this policy-level evaluation is still causal: we imagine interventions on which policy we adopt, then examine how the causal fabric of the world\u2014including Death\u2019s predictive method\u2014responds.\n\nOne might notice that this policy-causal view converges, in the Death in Damascus family of cases, with the recommendation of Evidential Decision Theory: both pick the act that correlates best with safety.  The convergence is not accidental.  When the environment contains sophisticated predictors and copies of yourself, purely causal reasoning at the micro-act level becomes too poor an information diet: the policy you choose is itself a causal factor for the distant state.  A consistent causal theory must therefore be applied at the right grain.  Once that shift is made, the dependence of EU on moment\u2010to\u2010moment act probabilities vanishes.\n\nConclusion  \n\nCDT\u2019s act-probability dependence in Death in Damascus cases is not just an artefact of toy mathematics.  It signals a normative flaw: advice that hinges on unstable self-locating credences violates deliberative invariance, enables money pumps, and collapses under modest predictive feedback from the environment.  Attempts to rescue CDT by importing deliberation equilibria or causal randomisation either smuggle in evidential considerations or leave the instability untouched when predictors look one level higher.  The clean solution is to move CDT\u2019s point of application from *local acts* to *global policies*.  Once we do, the expected utility of a policy no longer oscillates with the agent\u2019s shifting view of her own future act, and rational choice regains stability.  Whether one then still calls the resulting theory \u201cCDT\u201d or acknowledges that the border between causal and evidential reasoning has blurred is largely terminological.  What matters is that by stepping back we avoid the self-referential mire into which orthodox CDT sinks whenever the world can guess what we are about to decide.", "output_tokens": 4037, "reasoning_tokens": 768}

Introduction and Thesis\n\nCausal Decision Theory (CDT) has long been sold as the best way to reconcile two thoughts that sit uneasily together: first, that rational choice should aim at maximizing expected utility; second, that the expectations that matter are those that track causal rather than merely evidential correlations. But the much-discussed \u201cDeath in Damascus\u201d story seems to reveal an internal tension in the view. As I shall argue, the tension is real and serious. CDT\u2019s expected-utility calculation makes the value of an act a function of the agent\u2019s own present probability of performing that act. During deliberation that probability predictably changes, and\u2014alarmingly\u2014the theory\u2019s recommendation can flip back and forth in response. This dependence produces three inter\u2010locking pathologies: (i) diachronic instability (the agent can cycle forever); (ii) practical incoherence (the agent\u2019s all-things-considered evaluation of an option presupposes a credence in that very option that the evaluation itself is meant to settle); and (iii) vulnerability to \u201cmanipulable games\u201d in which others can exploit the instability. The upshot, I claim, is that CDT in its standard form fails to satisfy a minimal norm of deliberative stability. Fixes are available, but each either abandons CDT\u2019s causal-only spirit or collapses it into a more global choice procedure akin to what recent writers call \u201cpolicy-based\u201d or \u201cfunctional\u201d decision theory. Pace some defenders, then, the dependence on act probabilities is not a harmless curiosity; it is a structural vulnerability that forces a theoretical re-orientation.\n\nI develop the argument in five stages. Section 2 rehearses the Death in Damascus case and shows formally how act probabilities enter the CDT calculus. Section 3 diagnoses the three pathologies just mentioned. Section 4 surveys and critiques the main CDT-friendly replies: (a) the \u201cscreen-off self-knowledge\u201d reply, (b) the \u201cratifiability\u201d reply, and (c) the \u201ctick-tock\u201d or \u201cdeliberation dynamics\u201d reply. Section 5 sketches a recomposition of CDT into a policy-level view that blocks the problem but at a cost: it ceases to be recognizable as orthodox CDT. I close with a brief moral about what the episode teaches us concerning the relation between causal reasoning and agency.\n\n2. How act probabilities get inside the CDT formula\n\n2.1 The setup\n\nSuppose you learn that the Grim Reaper\u2014call him \u201cDeath\u201d\u2014will appear tomorrow evening in whichever of two cities he predicted you would visit that day. Death\u2019s predictive accuracy is high but not perfect: conditional on your going to Damascus, he is there with probability .9; conditional on your going to Aleppo, with probability .95. You also know that Death is somewhat biased toward predicting Damascus: ex ante, before factoring in what you will do, he is 60 % likely to choose \u201cDamascus.\u201d You value survival at 0 and death at \u20131000. Travel costs are trivial. Which city should you choose?\n\n2.2 CDT\u2019s standard recipe\n\nCDT evaluates each act by summing utilities over the possible causal antecedents of that act\u2014world-states that are *not* themselves effects of the act. For each such state S and act A, CDT plugs in the \u201ccausal probability\u201d P(S | do(A)), i.e. the probability of S conditional on a hypothetical intervention that fixes A, then multiplies by the utility of the outcome that results when one performs A in S.\n\nIn Death in Damascus the only state variable that matters causally upstream of your act is where Death will be. Let D be the event \u201cDeath is in Damascus,\u201d \u00acD the event \u201cDeath is in Aleppo.\u201d Your choice of city does not cause Death\u2019s location\u2014he is already en route\u2014which makes his location upstream. Hence:\n\nV_CDT(Damascus) = P(D | do(Damascus)) \u00b7 (\u20131000) + P(\u00acD | do(Damascus)) \u00b7 0\nV_CDT(Aleppo)    = P(D | do(Aleppo)) \u00b7 (\u20131000) + P(\u00acD | do(Aleppo)) \u00b7 0.\n\n2.3 Where the dependence enters\n\nThe causal probabilities P(D | do(A)) are not purely exogenous; they depend on how confident you currently are that you will do A. Why? Because Death\u2019s earlier prediction is highly correlated with the very evidence you are now using to estimate your action: your total body of information about your deliberative tendencies, dispositions, and so forth. Precisely insofar as you assign some live probability p to your visiting Damascus, you should assign approximately the same p to Death\u2019s having predicted Damascus (modulo his Damascus bias and reliability coefficients). A quick Bayesian calculation gives:\n\nP(D | do(Damascus)) = .9 p + .05 (1\u2013p)  \nP(D | do(Aleppo))   = .1 p + .95 (1\u2013p).\n\nSubstituting, we get:\n\nV_CDT(Damascus) = \u20131000[.9 p + .05 (1\u2013p)]  \nV_CDT(Aleppo)   = \u20131000[.1 p + .95 (1\u2013p)].\n\nSimplify:\n\nV_CDT(Damascus) = \u20131000(.05 + .85 p)  \nV_CDT(Aleppo)   = \u20131000(.95 \u2013 .85 p).\n\nNotice what now drives choice: if p > .5, Damascus has the smaller negative expected utility; if p < .5, Aleppo does.\n\n2.4 The feedback loop\n\nBut p is (in part) under your deliberative control. If you currently lean 60 % toward Damascus (p = .6), CDT tells you Damascus is safer (\u2013565 vs \u2013255). Acting on that advice will push p toward 1, which in turn further entrenches the judgment that Damascus dominates. Conversely, if you start at p = .4, Aleppo looks safer; switching allegiance nudges p down toward 0, vindicating the new plan. The CDT recommendation thus tracks a moving target\u2014the very credence it presumes in its input\u2014creating a self-referential loop. Nothing in the bare theoretical apparatus tells you where the loop stops.\n\n3. Three problems generated by the loop\n\n3.1 Diachronic instability\n\nAn ideally reflective agent is supposed to converge on a choice after sufficient calculation. Yet CDT permits perpetual oscillation: I begin with p = .49, judge Aleppo safer, revise p toward 0. But mid-way, as p dips below some threshold, the \u201ctendency toward Damascus\u201d built into Death\u2019s bias can pull expected utilities the other way; noticing this, I revise p back up, and so on ad infinitum. In economic terms the decision problem lacks a Nash equilibrium in mixed strategies because the payoff matrix is endogenous to the mixed proportions.\n\n3.2 Practical incoherence\n\nMore subtly, CDT violates what John Pollock called the \u201cdeliberative constraint\u201d: an agent should not be asked to conditionalize on probabilities of actions whose very purpose is to be settled by the deliberation. When CDT multiplies utilities by a factor containing p, the agent must input a number for p. But prior to deciding, the only coherent value for p is indeterminate or at best an interval (\u201csomewhere between 0 and 1\u201d). The evaluation is therefore under-determinate. A theory that instructs us to compute something we cannot coherently specify, on pain of circularity, falls short as a practical guide.\n\n3.3 Exploitability\n\nBecause your choice hinges sensitively on your credence about your own choice, a wily adversary can nudge that credence and thereby bend your action. Suppose a rival agent can broadcast (credible) statistics about people \u201clike you\u201d showing they usually go to Damascus. Learning this raises p, steering you into Damascus\u2014just where the adversary has laid a different trap. Ordinary CDT offers no defense: updating on the data is epistemically mandatory; the ensuing act switch follows mechanically.\n\nThese three pathologies do not merely make CDT inconvenient. They cast doubt on its claim to capture the norms of rational agency, for rationality includes living with one\u2019s future self in stable accord, possessing coherent deliberative procedures, and avoiding predictable exploitation.\n\n4. Can orthodox CDT evade the charge?\n\nFour principal strategies have been proposed.\n\n4.1 Screen-off self-knowledge: \u201ctake p = \u00bd\u201d\n\nOne thought is to quarantine the special evidence you have about your own tendencies. Use instead a \u201cpre-deliberative state\u201d in which you treat your action as causally open with equal odds, setting p = \u00bd. Then:\n\nV_CDT(Damascus) = V_CDT(Aleppo) = \u2013525.\n\nSymmetry breaks only when you factor in the .05 bias toward Damascus guesses, pushing Damascus slightly better. So you should go to Damascus, full stop. Problem solved?\n\nNot quite. First, the move is ad hoc: why \u00bd rather than evidentially supported numbers? Second, the screening violates CDT\u2019s core mandate to condition on all upstream information. Third, even granted, the bias toward Damascus can be arbitrarily small; then the prescription remains hostage to our choice of \u201cfair\u201d baseline p. The instability re-emerges.\n\n4.2 Ratifiability\n\nJeffrey and later Sobel proposed that a rational decision must be *ratifiable*: the agent, upon learning she is about to choose A, should not regret A. That requirement filters out choices whose expected value would flip once you include the information \u201cI\u2019m (just about to) do A.\u201d In Death in Damascus there is no ratifiable pure strategy. The only ratifiable option is a 50-50 mixed strategy in which you randomize. This defeats the dependence on p because p is no longer contingent. However, ratification is a blunt instrument. It counsels randomization even when a tiny tweak in the game, e.g. an extra penny of cost for Aleppo, would make Damascus uniquely best by any common-sense standard. Worse, ratification is silent on how to implement the coin flip in a way Death cannot predict (a point flagged by Hofbauer and Sigmund 1988). So while ratifiability obviates cycling, it introduces pragmatic absurdities.\n\n4.3 Deliberation dynamics or \u201ctick-tock CDT\u201d\n\nAnother family of replies says: treat the changing p\u2019s as stages in a dynamical system and stipulate that deliberation stops at the first fixed point. If I foresee that continued reflection will raise my p beyond .5 and thus entrench Damascus, I jump straight there. But this begs the question: which fixed point counts if more than one exists? In the standard parameterization (.9/.95 accuracy and .6 bias) both p = 0 and p = 1 are stable. Choosing either is license-compatible with CDT. The theory again under-determines choice.\n\n4.4 Interlude: why the replies falter\n\nEach of these maneuvers patches local symptoms yet clashes with deeper CDT commitments. Screening ignores evidence; ratifiability discards CDT\u2019s causal-expectation core in favor of what amounts to a consistency norm; dynamical stipulation smuggles in new decision rules. The persistence of patches hints that the problem is fundamental.\n\n5. Toward a policy-level alternative\n\n5.1 Where the trouble really lies\n\nCDT treats the agent\u2019s present option as an *event* divorced from the algorithm that selects it. That abstraction is sensible when the option\u2019s causal ancestry is independent of the selection algorithm, as in mundane errands. But in predictor cases the ancestry runs, via the opponent\u2019s model, straight through the algorithm. The conditional probabilities CDT needs cannot be coherently specified without modelling the algorithm. Hence the self-reference. Any adequate fix must therefore relocate the locus of evaluation one level up, from acts to *policies* (choosing mechanism plus act). Once the object of choice is a policy, the dependence on the probability of a single act evaporates, because the policy fully determines that probability.\n\n5.2 Sketch of a policy-based CDT\n\nThe simplest policy-upgrade says: evaluate a policy \u03c0 by the expected utility of the (act, state) pair that results when the world contains an implementation of \u03c0. Formally:\n\nU(\u03c0) = \u2211_s P(s | World implements \u03c0) \u00b7 u(Outcome(\u03c0, s)).\n\nAn agent then selects the policy that maximizes U. Importantly, \u201cimplements \u03c0\u201d is a *causal* description that screens off the agent\u2019s later internal coin flips; it fixes them by stipulation. Because the predictor has access to \u03c0 (by assumption in predictor problems), P(s | implements \u03c0) is well-defined. A variant of CDT\u2014call it Policy-CDT\u2014thus retains the central causal intervention idea but expands the intervention variable to the entire decision function.\n\n5.3 How Policy-CDT solves Death in Damascus\n\nThere are only two deterministic policies of interest:\n\n\u03c0_D: \u201cGo to Damascus.\u201d\n\u03c0_A: \u201cGo to Aleppo.\u201d\n\nCompute utilities:\n\nP(Death in Damascus | \u03c0_D) = .9  \nP(Death in Damascus | \u03c0_A) = .05.\n\nHence:\n\nU(\u03c0_D) = \u2013900  \nU(\u03c0_A) = \u201350.\n\n\u03c0_A strictly dominates. No instability arises; the result ignores the agent\u2019s credence in her future act because the act is fixed by the policy. (If stochastic policies are allowed, the optimum remains \u03c0_A for the given parameters.)\n\nNotice that the recommendation\u2014go to Aleppo\u2014contradicts the baseline CDT cycles, illustrating how the policy shift is not cosmetic but substantive.\n\n5.4 Relation to Functional Decision Theory (FDT) and Updateless EDT\n\nThe move parallels contemporary \u201cprogram-based\u201d approaches (Yudkowsky & Soares 2017) that urge agents to act as though choosing the *output* of their decision procedure, taking into account how others might predict that output. Policy-CDT coincides with FDT in standard predictor cases but diverges in others where causal networks contain structural arrows from policy to outcome bypassing predictors. What matters here is that the upgrade can be motivated entirely from inside CDT\u2019s causal commitments: the decision variable was mis-identified; fix that, and the looping pathology vanishes.\n\n5.5 Does this abandon CDT?\n\nPurists will object: CDT\u2019s charm is its local-act perspective; once we move to policies we smuggle in evidential reasoning. I reply that policy-level causation is still causal: adopting \u03c0 causes both your bodily motions and the predictor\u2019s expectation. If that feels evidential it is because in predictor scenarios the causation routes through shared source code rather than physical force. The moral is that agency is realized in code; any theory blind to code-level causal pathways will mis-fire.\n\n6. Objections and replies\n\nObjection 1: \u201cPolicy choice is incoherent; one can only choose an act at the moment.\u201d  \nReply: ordinary deliberation involves selecting in advance how one will respond to contingencies\u2014think of pre-commitment contracts. Nothing incoherent about choosing code one instant earlier than its execution.\n\nObjection 2: \u201cPolicy-CDT collapses into Evidential Decision Theory.\u201d  \nReply: only if every upstream variable correlating with the policy is treated as causally downstream. But policy itself can be surgically set via an intervention, preserving causal neutrality.\n\nObjection 3: \u201cWon\u2019t Policy-CDT mis-behave in cases without predictors?\u201d  \nReply: where others cannot predict your code, the conditional probabilities factor so that Policy-CDT reduces to ordinary CDT. The extension is conservative.\n\n7. Lessons and Conclusion\n\nDeath in Damascus reveals a fault line in orthodox CDT: by confining its causal analysis to local acts while treating antecedent mental states as evidentially but not causally linked to those acts, CDT gets trapped in a feedback loop where its own input (credence in the act) depends on the very output it seeks to generate. The resulting diachronic instability, deliberative circularity, and exploitability are not fringe anomalies; they show that agency cannot be cleanly decomposed into \u201cact now, update later.\u201d Rational choice must treat the *algorithm* as part of the causal fabric of the world, for agents and predictors routinely interact at that level.\n\nOnce we elevate the unit of choice to policies, a refined CDT regains its composure. That refinement, however, transforms the theory into something closer to functional or program-based decision rules\u2014no longer act-centric, no longer indifferent to logically upstream correlations. The dependence on act probabilities is therefore not a superficial glitch but a sign that CDT, in its original locus, is too small a theory of agency. Decision theorists must either enlarge CDT or adopt an alternative; clinging to the status quo is untenable.", "output_tokens": 3841, "reasoning_tokens": 256}

The Shape of the Worry\n\nCausal Decision Theory (CDT) begins from a seemingly simple recipe: for every act A under consideration, evaluate its causal consequences, weight the utilities of those consequences by the probability that they occur if\u2014\u200bin the purely causal sense\u2014\u200byou do A, and choose the act with the highest resulting expected utility.  The \u201cDeath in Damascus\u2019\u2019 story appears at first to be a straightforward test of that recipe.  You wake up in Baghdad.  You know that Death, who is an extremely good but not perfect predictor of your behavior, plans to meet you today in whichever of the two nearby cities he predicted you would visit, and that an encounter with Death is terminally bad for you (-100).  A peaceful day in the other city is neutral (0).  You also know one further empirical quirk: when Death is uncertain he guesses Damascus slightly more often than Aleppo.  Currently your credence that Death is in Damascus sits at 0.6, and your credence that you will in fact go to Damascus hovers at 0.5.  You start deliberating.\n\nHere is the CDT cookbook applied na\u00efvely:\n\nEU(Damascus) = (Prob(Death in Damascus | you go to Damascus) \u00d7 \u2013100) + (Prob(Death not in Damascus | you go to Damascus) \u00d7 0).  \nEU(Aleppo) = (Prob(Death in Aleppo | you go to Aleppo) \u00d7 \u2013100) + \u2026\n\nBecause you regard Death\u2019s location as independent of the city conditional on your act (that is, you take yourself not to causally influence where Death already decided to wait), you set\n\nProb(Death in Damascus | go to Damascus) = Prob(Death in Damascus) = 0.6  \nProb(Death in Aleppo | go to Aleppo)     = 0.4.\n\nSo Damascus looks worse: \u201360 vs \u201340, and CDT tells you to flee to Aleppo.\n\nYet an odd phenomenon now kicks in.  The very moment you form the resolution \u201cI\u2019ll go to Aleppo,\u201d you reduce your credence that you will actually go to Damascus\u2014\u200bafter all, you now regard heading to Damascus as quite unlikely.  Suppose the credence of going to Damascus falls from 0.5 to 0.1.  But reflection on Death\u2019s reliability tells you that if you probably go to Aleppo, Death probably predicted Aleppo.  Your unconditional credence that Death waits in Aleppo therefore creeps upward.  Run the CDT numbers again and you may discover that going to Damascus now has the higher causal expected utility.  And round you go: whichever city looks better under CDT, deciding for it shifts your act credences, which shifts your belief about Death\u2019s location, which reverses the decision.  There need be no stable point.\n\nThe question before us:  Is this dependence of CDT\u2019s recommendations on the agent\u2019s current act-probabilities a genuine defect of the theory?  My answer is Yes.  I will argue that the dependence produces three interlocking problems\u2014\u200bpragmatic instability, epistemic circularity, and normative inadequacy\u2014\u200beach of which violates CDT\u2019s own guiding motivation.  I will then examine the best-known defenses and show why they fall short, before sketching a repair that preserves CDT\u2019s causal core while excising the malignant self-reference.\n\nII. Pragmatic Instability: The Guidance Failure\n\nThe first task of a decision theory is to guide choice.  Guidance requires what James Joyce calls \u201cdeliberative stability\u201d: once an agent has run the decision procedure, she should be able to treat its output as a fixed point and act on it.  Classic CDT in Death-like cases fails that test, because the recipe uses as an input the very quantity\u2014credence in performing A\u2014\u200bthat the output is supposed to determine.\n\nOne might insist that the theory delivers a determinate directive at every instant and that the swirl of shifting credences simply reflects the fact that the agent is still deliberating.  But real-time guidance is not enough.  A usable decision procedure must also allow an agent to settle her intention, stop internal bookkeeping, and execute.  CDT here resembles a faulty thermostat whose sensor is mounted inside the heating element it controls: measure, react, overshoot, measure again, and so on in a potentially endless loop.  When the device meant to terminate dithering instead perpetuates it, something has gone wrong with the design.\n\nIII. Epistemic Circularity: The Counterfactual Confusion\n\nCDT\u2019s own philosophical selling point is that it cares about causal up-shots rather than mere correlations.  But in Death, the probability figure on which the evaluation of Damascus versus Aleppo turns is not a causal probability at all; it is the bare unconditional probability that Death is in a given city, which the agent updates by conditioning on her current self-estimate about her act.  That act-estimate, in turn, is inferred from the agent\u2019s current preference between the options.  So the \u201ccausal\u201d expected utilities smuggle in, through the back door, evidence about what one is likely to choose\u2014\u200bexactly the sort of evidential dependence CDT was erected to exclude.\n\nPut schematically:\n\n(1) EU_CDT(A) = \u03a3_s Prob(s) \u00d7 U(s \u2297 A),  \nwhere s ranges over states not downstream of A.\n\nBut the agent\u2019s credence function Prob_t at time t is itself a function of t\u2019s output of EU_CDT.  That renders EU_CDT implicitly self-referential.  A genuine causal evaluation should vary only with facts about the causal system, not with introspective facts about how sure I currently am that I will press the left or right button.  When those introspective facts alter the result, the calculation ceases to be an assessment of the act\u2019s independent causal potency and instead becomes a hall of mirrors.\n\nIV. Normative Inadequacy: The Ratifiability Crash\n\nGibbard and Harper introduced the concept of ratifiability: a recommendation is ratifiable if, upon believing that you will follow it, you still endorse it.  Death-style cases show that CDT frequently issues unratifiable advice, advice whose acceptability evaporates the moment you take it.  Such self-effacing prescriptions are not merely psychologically awkward; they contravene the normative rationale of CDT.  The whole point of isolating causal influence was to secure advice that the agent could regard as epistemically stable irrespective of what she currently believes about her own behavior.  When ratifiability collapses, the theory contradicts its founding aspiration.\n\nV. Three Standard Replies and Their Limits\n\nReply 1: \u201cFreeze probabilities at the outset.\u201d  \nDefenders sometimes maintain that the relevant unconditional probabilities are those that obtain before deliberation begins; once we fix that prior, CDT yields a single recommendation, Aleppo, and we are done.  Unfortunately, serious deliberation is itself a source of evidence.  Reflection on your emerging intention\u2014\u200ba twitch toward the motor plan for Aleppo, say\u2014\u200bis as epistemically relevant as noticing which way the wind blows.  A decision theory that orders you to ignore perfectly good evidence about where Death likely is (namely, evidence about your nascent choice) disconnects decision from belief-updating in an ad hoc way.  Worse, the \u201cfreeze\u201d maneuver generalizes poorly.  In more realistic settings an agent rarely knows when deliberation starts or finishes; immobilizing credences is both unprincipled and impractical.\n\nReply 2: \u201cThe mixed-strategy fixed point.\u2019\u2019  \nAnother suggestion is that stability is restored if the agent adopts the probabilities that make her indifferent between Damascus and Aleppo\u2014\u200bin effect, play a mixed strategy whose chance component the agent somehow implements.  But CDT provides no resources for preferring the unique mixed strategy to any pure strategy; indeed, standard CDT regards mixed acts as dominated, because tossing a coin has all the same causal consequences as going straight to Damascus or Aleppo but with added disutility from delay.  Introducing mixed strategies here is a patch imported from game theory, not something CDT can justify internally.\n\nReply 3: \u201cCausal modeling with the do-operator.\u2019\u2019  \nA sophisticated line holds that the dependence on act-probabilities is irrelevant once we distinguish between conditioning on A and intervening on A (Pearl\u2019s do(A)).  Prob(Death in Damascus | do(Aleppo)) is, by hypothesis, 0.6 regardless of what I currently think I will do.  Therefore EU_CDT is stable.  The difficulty is that, in Death, the very same structural model that licenses the do-calculus says there is a causal arrow from my deliberative state to Death\u2019s earlier prediction (because Death predicted on the basis of evidence about my dispositions).  A clean do-intervention would have to cut that arrow, but then the model no longer represents the scenario.  The do-calculus thus obtains stability only by stipulating away the predictor\u2019s correlation\u2014\u200bin effect, making Death a stranger who guesses at random.  That is not a defense of CDT in the original case but a re-description of the case into one in which the phenomenon disappears.\n\nVI. Digging Deeper: Where the Self-Reference Comes From\n\nStep back.  Why does CDT need probabilities of non-downstream states at all?  The answer is that CDT endorses a one-shot act-evaluation perspective: hold fixed everything you do not causally affect and compare the worlds.  In most mundane settings, the probabilities of those background states are exogenous to the decision and hence stable.  In prediction cases they are not: because the predictor\u2019s state is itself a causal descendant of your character traits, deliberation provides evidence about that state.  So the background/non-background distinction on which CDT relies becomes porous.  The predictor\u2019s location is downstream of your long-term dispositions, but not downstream of the momentary muscular contraction that sends you to Damascus or Aleppo.  CDT\u2019s act-level granularity is too coarse to register that subtle causal structure.  The result is that evidence about downstream-of-you variables is illegitimately imported into the calculation.\n\nVII. A Better Way: Policy-Causal Decision Theory\n\nWe might conclude that CDT is hopeless, but the core idea\u2014care only about consequences you can causally influence\u2014\u200bis intuitively attractive.  The trick is to shift the unit of analysis from acts to policies.  Call the alternative Policy-CDT (PCDT):\n\nPCDT Prescription:  \n1. Treat the agent\u2019s entire disposition to act in response to her epistemic state\u2014\u200bwhat game theorists call a pure strategy\u2014\u200bas the causal intervention variable.  \n2. For each candidate policy \u03c0, compute EU(\u03c0) = \u03a3_s Prob(s) \u00d7 U(s \u2297 \u03c0(s)), where s now ranges over complete histories up to the choice-point, including the predictor\u2019s earlier observations.  \n3. Choose the policy with maximal EU.\n\nBecause a policy is selected before the predictor gathers data, Death\u2019s location is downstream of the causal variable.  Hence the unconditional probability of Death being in Damascus given policy \u03c0 is sensitive to \u03c0 but wholly independent of the agent\u2019s real-time credence that she will execute Damascus at the final moment.  There is no self-reference.  In the Death case, the policy \u201calways go to the city the predictor is less likely to select\u2019\u2019 yields higher expected utility than its rival and is stable under ratification.\n\nThe shift from acts to policies is not ad hoc.  It aligns CDT with the interventionist credo: manipulate the aspect of the world you genuinely control.  You do not causally manipulate your muscular spasm in isolation from the process that gives rise to it; you manipulate the deliberative procedure that determinately issues in that spasm.  Once we see that, the need to consult real-time act-probabilities evaporates.\n\nVIII. Does PCDT Abandon Core CDT?\n\nNo.  What CDT really cares about is screening off mere evidential correlations from causal efficacy.  Policy-level appraisal preserves that spirit while avoiding the mathematical pathology.  The dependence on act-probabilities was never a constitutive commitment of CDT; it was a pragmatic shortcut that works when predictors are absent.  PCDT keeps the shortcut where safe and avoids it where not.\n\nIX. Objection and Reply\n\nObjection: \u201cPolicy evaluation is computationally intractable; human agents cannot survey all contingencies, so CDT needs an act-based rule.\u201d\n\nReply:  Normative principles need not match human bandwidth.  Besides, policy evaluation can proceed incrementally: one need only compare the currently salient policies, not the power-set of possibilities.  More importantly, tractability is not worth a theory that yields advice an idealized version of oneself cannot stably endorse.  Guidance for bounded agents can be layered atop a sound ideal theory; it cannot rescue an unsound one.\n\nObjection: \u201cThe predictor\u2019s reliability need not stem from your policy; it may stem from microphysical cues emitted milliseconds before choice.  Then your policy does not causally influence Death\u2019s earlier decision.\u201d\n\nReply:  Fine-grained versions of the predictor scenario raise deep questions about personal identity across time scales.  If the micro-cues are causally downstream of your deliberation, PCDT treats them as such; if not, then even EDT (evidential decision theory) cannot exploit them.  The dependence of Death\u2019s location on your gradual choice-formation is what makes the example arresting.  When that dependence is broken, the case collapses into one where CDT and common sense agree.\n\nX. Wider Implications\n\n1. Newcomb\u2019s Problem.  The same analysis explains why many philosophers have the intuition to one-box.  The one-box policy, chosen earlier, causally controls the filling of the opaque box via the predictor; the two-box policy does not.\n\n2. Dynamic Consistency.  Policy-level CDT meshes with sophisticated choice in game theory, where agents adopt strategies that remain optimal at every node given knowledge of the strategy.  It thereby restores the link between causal decision theory and the principles of sequential rationality.\n\n3. Implementation in AI.  Current work in \u201ccounterfactual planning\u2019\u2019 for AI safety already moves toward policy-level evaluation.  The need to inoculate agents against nasty predictor feedback loops is practical, not merely philosophical.\n\nXI. Conclusion\n\nYes, CDT\u2019s dependence on the agent\u2019s fluctuating act-probabilities in Death-type scenarios is a genuine problem.  It produces guidance failure, smuggles evidential correlations back into an allegedly causal calculus, and issues unratifiable advice.  Attempts to rescue the standard act-based formulation by freezing priors, by recommending mixed strategies, or by invoking the do-operator without a matching causal model, all misfire.  The root of the trouble is that CDT evaluates local acts rather than global policies, thereby ignoring that predictors exploit evidence about the very process that issues in the act.  Once we raise the grain of causal intervention from acts to policies, the instability disappears.  The resulting Policy-CDT retains CDT\u2019s motivational core while avoiding epistemic circularity and pragmatic self-defeat.

Introduction and Thesis\n\nCausal Decision Theory (CDT) tells an agent to pick the act whose causal expected utility is highest, where the expectation is taken with respect to her unconditional credence distribution over states that are not causally downstream of the act. In Death-in-Damascus cases that distribution is not exogenous: what city one ends up crediting Death with predicting depends partly on how likely one now takes oneself to be to go to that city. Consequently the causal expected utility of each act slides around as one\u2019s own act-probabilities shift during deliberation. I shall argue that this dependence is not a mere curiosity but signals a deep flaw in CDT. The core of the worry is that CDT\u2019s evaluating rule presupposes a stable set of unconditional probabilities, yet in self-referential environments it requires the agent to consult probabilities that are themselves being reshaped by the very deliberation the rule is supposed to guide. That renders CDT normatively unstable: the \u201cought\u201d that it delivers is hostage to arbitrary, flickering credences about what one is about to do. In such environments CDT cannot even guarantee the existence of a deliberatively stable recommendation short of trivial or dominated courses of action, and so fails to give determinate, reason-giving advice.\n\nThe argument proceeds in six steps. (i) I lay out a stylised Death-in-Damascus model and show how CDT\u2019s expectation formula imports act-probabilities. (ii) I exhibit the resulting phenomenon of deliberative seesawing. (iii) I distinguish three potential diagnoses\u2014epistemic, psychological, structural\u2014and show why only the structural one targets CDT itself. (iv) I argue that the instability violates a ratifiability requirement implicit in rational deliberation. (v) I rebut two CDT-friendly replies: the claim that rational agents should assign degenerate act-probabilities, and the suggestion that the right object of choice is not an act but a mixed strategy. (vi) I sketch two paths forward\u2014policy selection and counterfactual-entropy decision theory\u2014to indicate how one might repair the defect, though each involves abandoning a key CDT commitment.\n\n2. Formalising Death-in-Damascus\n\nSuppose you wake knowing that today Death will take you unless you avoid being in the city he predicted you would visit. Death\u2019s prediction mechanism is 90 % reliable and has a built-in bias toward guessing Damascus: ceteris paribus his prior probability of guessing Damascus is 0.6, Aleppo 0.4. You value survival at 10 utils and death at \u221210. Travel is costless.\n\nDenote acts by A (go to Aleppo) and D (go to Damascus). The relevant upstream states encode Death\u2019s prediction, noted as PA and PD. Outcomes are:\n\nA & PA\u2003\u2003safe\u2003\u200310  \nA & PD\u2003\u2003dead\u2003 \u221210  \nD & PD\u2003\u2003safe\u2003\u200310  \nD & PA\u2003\u2003dead\u2003 \u221210  \n\nLet P(PA) = 0.4, P(PD) = 0.6 before deliberation. Death\u2019s reliability \u03b2 = 0.9 means P(PA\u2006|\u2006A) = \u03b2 and P(PD\u2006|\u2006A) = 1 \u2212 \u03b2, and symmetrically for going to Damascus. CDT\u2019s prescription is to evaluate each act by causal expected utility (CEU):\n\nCEU(A) = \u03a3s P(s) U(outcome given A, s).\n\nBecause the states include Death\u2019s prediction but exclude your act, CDT uses the unconditional probabilities P(PA) and P(PD), not the conditional probabilities given the act. So at t\u2080 one computes:\n\nCEU\u2080(A) = 0.4\u00b710 + 0.6\u00b7(\u221210) = \u22122  \nCEU\u2080(D) = 0.6\u00b710 + 0.4\u00b7(\u221210) = 2\n\nSo CDT initially recommends going to Damascus. But\u2014and this is the kicker\u2014those unconditional probabilities were derived from your original credence about what you would do. If during deliberation you come to regard A as more likely than D, you must revise the priors about Death\u2019s guess correspondingly (because you took his bias and reliability to be features of his predictor). Suppose halfway through you now think you will choose Aleppo with probability 0.7. Updating mechanically yields new priors P(PA) = 0.58, P(PD) = 0.42 and hence:\n\nCEU\u2081(A) = 0.58\u00b710 + 0.42\u00b7(\u221210) = 1.6  \nCEU\u2081(D) = 0.42\u00b710 + 0.58\u00b7(\u221210) = \u22121.6\n\nThe preferred act has flipped. Nothing in the world outside your head has changed; only your act-probabilities have shifted, yet CDT\u2019s advice has reversed. Another round of reflection reverses the credences again, generating a deliberative oscillation with no fixed point.\n\n3. Diagnosing the Oscillation\n\nOne might suspect three culprits.\n\nEpistemic: perhaps the agent mismanages conditionalisation. But she is updating her credences about Death\u2019s guess via perfectly ordinary Bayesian conditioning on her own behavioural evidence. No epistemic norm is violated.\n\nPsychological: maybe real humans cannot sustain such rapid endogenous updates. Yet the worry here is normative, not empirical. Even an ideally rational agent following CDT\u2019s rule would feel the seesaw.\n\nStructural: the instability stems from CDT\u2019s very formula because it treats the unconditional probabilities over predictor states as inputs, whereas they in fact depend on the outputs\u2014her contemplated act probabilities. This is the correct diagnosis: CDT assumes independence between the choice variable and the prior over upstream variables, an assumption that fails in self-referential setups.\n\n4. Ratifiability and the Need for a Fixed Point\n\nJeffrey introduced the notion of ratifiable choices: an act is ratifiable when, after learning that one will perform it, one would still endorse it. Viewed through that lens, the Death-in-Damascus oscillation shows that CDT can recommend acts that are unratifiable relative to the very credences it uses in the expectation calculus. At t\u2080 CDT says \u201cgo to Damascus,\u201d but the moment one embraces that advice one\u2019s credence that one will go to Damascus spikes, driving up P(PD) and turning Damascus into the option with negative CEU. The choice undermines the grounds on which it was chosen. Conversely, any act that is ratifiable must solve the fixed-point equation CEU(a; P\u2070) \u2265 CEU(b; P\u2070) for all alternatives b, where P\u2070 are the priors that incorporate the fact that one chooses a. In our toy numbers neither pure act satisfies that equation; the only fixed point is a mixed strategy that equalises the unconditional priors (choose each city with probability 0.5, so Death\u2019s bias is neutralised). CDT, however, was never designed to select mixtures; its locus of evaluation is the act actually issued at the decision node. Hence it generates recommendations that self-sabotage.\n\nMore generally, any theory of rational choice should possess what we might call deliberative stability: following its advice should not predictably undermine the expected-utility comparison that constituted the advice. CDT lacks that property in predictor environments.\n\n5. Two CDT-Friendly Replies and Why They Fail\n\nReply 1: \u201cA rational agent should assign her own future acts probability one. Intentions settle probabilities; once you intend D, P(D)=1, so no oscillation arises.\u201d  \nRebuttal: CDT\u2019s recommendation is supposed to guide the formation of that very intention. Before the intention is fixed, a non-degenerate distribution over acts is appropriate. Imposing degenerate self-credences at the outset amounts to smuggling a bootstrap principle\u2014\u201cdecide, then evaluate\u201d\u2014that empties the theory of normative force.\n\nReply 2: \u201cThe real options are not acts but mixed strategies. CDT ought to compare lotteries over acts, find the Nash equilibrium at 0.5/0.5, and there stability is restored.\u201d  \nRebuttal: (a) CDT as standardly formulated treats intentional acts, not self-probabilising lotteries, as the decision objects. (b) Even if we retrofit it, the theory\u2019s core motivational story collapses. The reason CEU(A) was attractive originally is that A would causally produce safe outcomes when Death predicted Aleppo. Introducing a mixed strategy means the act chosen at the decision node is still deterministic; the lottery occurs earlier in a hypothetical randomiser independent of your brain. The causal influence structure thereby changes, and it is no longer clear that CDT evaluations over policies deliver the same causal counterfactuals it was meant to model. In effect, the repair morphs CDT into a kind of policy-selection Evidential Decision Theory.\n\n6. Why the Instability Is a Problem for CDT Itself\n\nThe defender might still say, \u201cSure, CDT is silent in weird self-referential scenarios, but so what? Decision theory\u2019s main job is ordinary causal choice.\u201d That answer is unsatisfying for two reasons.\n\nFirst, Death-in-Damascus is not an isolated pathology. Any environment containing predictors\u2014financial markets anticipating trades, opponents in repeated games, even one\u2019s own future self in dynamic choice\u2014injects precisely the same feedback loop. If CDT cannot supply determinate guidance in these commonplace strategic contexts, its range of applicability is cramped.\n\nSecond, rival theories cope better. Evidential Decision Theory (EDT) keeps the unconditional probabilities conditioned on the evidence of one\u2019s act, thereby factoring in that performing A is evidence that Death predicted A. EDT therefore stably recommends a 0.5/0.5 mixture, in line with ratifiability. Functional Decision Theory (FDT) and policy-selection accounts also generate determinate advice without deliberative oscillation. The comparative failure of CDT counts against it.\n\n7. Possible Repairs and Their Costs\n\nPath A: Ratifiable CDT. Demand that an act is choice-worthy only if it is a fixed point of CDT evaluation. In Death-in-Damascus this selects either the mixed strategy or the dominating option \u201cstay home,\u201d if available. But this supplement is ad hoc; it changes CDT\u2019s decision criterion from maximising causal expected utility to maximising causal EU subject to ratifiability, and in Newcomb-like problems it pushes CDT toward EDT verdicts, undermining the distinctive motivation for CDT.\n\nPath B: Policy-Selection CDT. Shift the unit of agency from an act at a node to a global policy mapping predictor beliefs to acts. One then computes causal EU relative to policy-level counterfactuals that hold the algorithm fixed across worlds. That eliminates feedback during deliberation because the act-probabilities are buried inside a policy that is treated as exogenous at evaluation time. But this is essentially the move Yudkowsky and Soares call Functional Decision Theory; adopting it forsakes CDT\u2019s insistence on local, act-level causal independence.\n\nEither fix illustrates the moral: to restore deliberative stability one must abandon the standard CDT formula.\n\n8. Conclusion\n\nDependence on act probabilities is indeed a problem for CDT. It is not merely a technical nuisance but a symptom of a mismatch between CDT\u2019s act-level, one-shot evaluation rule and the reflexive structure of real-world deliberation in which beliefs about what one will do feed back into beliefs about non-downstream states. The resulting oscillation violates ratifiability, deprives CDT of determinate recommendations in predictor-rich environments, and forces either a retreat to degenerate self-credences or a theoretical overhaul that abandons CDT\u2019s core principles. A decision theory whose advice evaporates the moment one begins to follow it is normatively defective. The Death-in-Damascus puzzle therefore reveals a deep instability at the heart of causal decision theory.", "output_tokens": 2925, "reasoning_tokens": 384}

Introduction and Thesis\n\nCausal Decision Theory (CDT) is advertised as a way of isolating the part of the world an agent can truly influence\u2014her causal downstream\u2014and then telling her to maximise expected utility with respect to that causal structure.  In ordinary cases that looks impeccable.  In the family of Death-in-Damascus (DiD) problems, however, the very act of deliberation alters the probabilities that CDT plugs into its expectation formula, and the theory\u2019s advice wobbles accordingly.  I shall argue that this sensitivity to an agent\u2019s shifting act-probabilities is not a harmless curiosity but a structural defect.  It leaves CDT without a stable decision rule, exposes an agent to exploitation, and ultimately betrays the purported motivation for CDT\u2014namely, to separate what you can control from what you merely learn about.  The only workable repairs (ratifiability, policy selection, or fixed-point requirements) amount to abandoning a core commitment of orthodox CDT.  So yes, the dependence is a genuine problem.\n\n2. The Set-Up: Death in Damascus\n\nSuppose you wake in Baghdad knowing Death is looking for you today.  You may flee to Aleppo or Damascus.  Death is an able predictor: with probability .9 he guesses the city you will choose.  When he guesses right, he waits there; when he guesses wrong, he mistakenly goes to the other city.  If he finds you, you die (utility = 0).  If you miss him, you live (utility = 10).  Finally, you have a prior belief that Death slightly prefers guessing Damascus: P(D predicts Damascus) = .6 in the absence of further information.\n\nTwo features generate trouble.\n\na) Your survival depends on the match (or mismatch) between a prediction that is not causally downstream of today\u2019s choice and the act you end up performing.\n\nb) The conditional probability of the predictor\u2019s location given that you go to Damascus is itself a function of how likely you currently think you are to go there.  The more firmly you intend Damascus, the more confident you become that Death predicted as much.\n\n3. How CDT Computes in DiD\n\nLet \u03b1 be your current subjective probability of going to Damascus.  (1-\u03b1) is your probability for Aleppo.  CDT advises:\n\nEU(Damascus) = 10 \u00d7 P(Death in Aleppo | do(Damascus))\nEU(Aleppo)    = 10 \u00d7 P(Death in Damascus | do(Aleppo))\n\nBecause Death guesses correctly 90 % of the time,\n\nP(Death in Damascus | do(Damascus)) = .9 + .1 \u00d7 P(D predicts Damascus | do(Damascus) & Death mispredicts)\nBut the misprediction clause collapses: if you do go to Damascus that fact is excellent evidence that Death predicted Damascus.  More compactly,\n\nP(Death in Damascus | do(Damascus)) = .9 \u00d7 P(D predicts Damascus | do(Damascus))\n                                    + .1 \u00d7 P(D predicts Aleppo | do(Damascus))  = .9\n\nSimilarly,\n\nP(Death in Damascus | do(Aleppo)) = .1 \u00d7 P(D predicts Damascus | do(Aleppo))\n                                 + .9 \u00d7 P(D predicts Aleppo | do(Aleppo)).\n\nThose conditional prediction probabilities depend on \u03b1.  Using Bayes\u2019 rule one obtains\n\nP(D predicts Damascus | do(Aleppo)) = (.6 \u00d7 .1) / (.6 \u00d7 .1 + .4 \u00d7 .9) = f(\u03b1),\n\nand a symmetric expression for the other term.  The algebra is less important than the moral: as \u03b1 slides around during deliberation, these conditional credences change continuously, and so CDT\u2019s EU numbers drift.\n\n4. The Instability: Chasing the Moving Target\n\nSuppose you start with \u03b1 = .6.  You therefore expect Death probably predicted Damascus.  EU(Damascus) \u2248 10 \u00d7 .9 = 9; EU(Aleppo) \u2248 10 \u00d7 .1 = 1.  CDT cries: \u201cFlee to Aleppo!\u201d  But the moment you start leaning towards Aleppo your \u03b1 falls, and you begin to think Death is less likely to have predicted Damascus.  Lower \u03b1 raises the conditional probability that Death predicted Aleppo, which increases the danger in Aleppo and reduces the danger in Damascus.  Soon EU(Damascus) is larger again and CDT reverses itself.  Back and forth the recommendations flip with no stable resting point except the knife-edge where \u03b1 is exactly that value for which the two expected utilities tie.\n\nOrthodox CDT thus offers guidance only after you have first solved the fixed-point equation: \u201cAdopt that mixture of acts whose very adoption makes you indifferent between acts.\u201d  But CDT itself never mentions fixed points; the need is smuggled in by the demand for deliberational stability.\n\n5. Three Symptoms of The Deeper Problem\n\n5.1 Lack of Action-Guidance\n\nA decision rule should tell you what to do; CDT in DiD instead hands you a differential equation for your credences.  Even the sophisticated agent able to solve for the equilibrium must first notice that CDT\u2019s advice is oscillating.  Nothing in the axioms explains why she should privilege the equilibrium over the oscillations.  So CDT fails the basic practical test: provide determinate, self-endorsing guidance.\n\n5.2 Dutch Books and Money Pumps\n\nAndy Egan (2007) exploits a variant to money-pump a CDT agent.  Offer a cheap binding contract to send her to whichever city she currently thinks safer; repeated oscillations guarantee she buys and sells the contract indefinitely, bleeding utility.  A theory that exposes fully rational agents to sure loss is at least pragmatically defective.\n\n5.3 Violation of Motivational Rationale\n\nCDT was sold on the slogan \u201conly causes matter to decision, correlations do not.\u201d  Yet the reason its expectations wobble is precisely that correlations with your own act re-enter through the back door: the conditional probability P(prediction | act).  CDT thus covertly relies on information it officially disdains.  The instability is the revenge of the correlations that causal purists hoped to ignore.\n\n6. Can CDT Be Defended?\n\nProponents have tried three lines of rescue.\n\n6.1 Exogenous Determinism\n\n\u201cOne\u2019s act-probabilities should be 0 or 1,\u201d say Joyce, Levi, and others.  Decision takes place after probabilities about one\u2019s own act have collapsed.  Unfortunately this means you must (somehow) choose before consulting CDT, then ask CDT to ratify the choice.  The direction of dependence\u2014guidance versus post-hoc vindication\u2014is reversed, nullifying CDT\u2019s practical use.\n\n6.2 Ratifiability\n\nJeffrey\u2019s notion of a ratifiable act is one that maximises expected utility conditional on performing that very act.  Applied here, the only ratifiable mixture is the fixed-point mixed strategy.  However, two problems remain.\n\na) Non-existence.  In variants with three options sometimes no mixture is ratifiable.\n\nb) Dominance.  The ratifiable act can be stochastically dominated by an unavailable but conceivable commitment (e.g., paying $1 for a coin flip that biases you slightly towards the safer city).  So ratifiability is neither guaranteed nor obviously desirable.\n\n6.3 Counterfactual Miracles\n\nLewis and Pearl suggest computing probabilities in a graph where \u201cdo(Aleppo)\u201d severs all informational links from the act to upstream nodes.  If one could insist that Death\u2019s prediction is upstream, then P(Death predicts Damascus | do(Aleppo)) = .6 regardless of \u03b1, erasing the instability.  The price is high: it treats one\u2019s beliefs about Death\u2019s prediction as eternally fixed, independent of any information gleaned during deliberation.  An agent who actually realises she is inclining to Aleppo thereby gets genuine evidence about the prediction; forbidding her from updating on that evidence is tantamount to hobbling Bayesian conditionalisation.\n\nTo summarise: each defence either strips CDT of the ability to learn from introspection or yields a different decision rule in disguise.\n\n7. Diagnosing the Malady: Deliberation Dependence\n\nWhere exactly does the pathology arise?  CDT feeds into its expectation formula the probabilities P(s | do(a)).  But the agent\u2019s credence function is itself dynamically linked to her uncertainty about which do-operator will be executed.  The formalism assumes an exogenous \u201cact node\u201d that one may wiggle independently of upstream parents; deliberation in realistic agents means the upstream parents obtain evidence about the eventual wiggle.  CDT\u2019s representation of agency is thus idealised in a way that breaks down precisely when other predictors model the agent.\n\nIn game-theoretic language, CDT treats a decision problem as a one-move game against nature; DiD reveals the need for an equilibrium concept sensitive to self-locating uncertainty and modelling mirrors.  What the agent selects is not, strictly speaking, an act but a policy: a mapping from informational states (including introspective ones) to acts.  Once the unit of choice is the whole policy, upstream predictors correlate with the policy rather than the particular act produced on one occasion, and the oscillation disappears.  But that is essentially the shift from act-focused CDT to policy-focused Functional Decision Theory or Updateless Decision Theory.  The cure is available only by changing theories.\n\n8. An Illuminating Variant: The Small-Switch Cost\n\nAdd a trivial cost \u03b5 (say, a penny) each time you change cities mid-deliberation.  Because CDT\u2019s recommendation flips infinitely often as you refine your credences, you pay an unbounded expected switch cost: for any finite N there is some stage of deliberation where you have already switched more than N times.  Yet an oracle offering to freeze your first impulse for $1 would save you an expected fortune.  That is a dominance argument: some available strategy weakly improves on whatever CDT leads you to do.  The deliberation dependence is not a mild inefficiency; it can be exploited to extract unbounded utility.\n\n9. Novel Framing: The Control\u2013Evidence Spectrum\n\nThe DiD pathology suggests a two-dimensional space of decision situations.\n\nDimension 1: Degree of causal control over the outcome.\nDimension 2: Degree of evidential correlation between your deliberation trajectory and the outcome.\n\nStandard CDT handles high-control/low-correlation cases beautifully.  Newcomb problems are low-control/high-correlation and favour EDT.  DiD occupies the mixed interior: moderate causal control entangled with moderate correlation.  Any satisfactory theory must handle the whole spectrum.  CDT\u2019s deliberation dependence shows it is limited to a boundary region.  This reframing reveals that the traditional CDT-v-EDT dichotomy was never exhaustive; a deeper synthesis (policy selection) is forced upon us by interior points like DiD.\n\n10. Objection and Reply\n\nObjection: \u201cOscillation merely shows that the agent lacks self-knowledge.  A perfectly rational agent would have sharp credences about her eventual act from the outset, eliminating \u03b1\u2019s drift and stabilising CDT\u2019s advice.\u201d\n\nReply: The objection conflates foreknowledge with rationality.  A rational deliberator can be uncertain about the outcome of a stochastic or even a deterministic internal process\u2014after all, she has finite computational power.  Forbidding such self-locating uncertainty would turn CDT into a decision theory for omniscient gods, not bounded agents like us.  Moreover, if an agent really did have deterministic foreknowledge (\u201cI will go to Damascus\u201d), then conditional on that knowledge the question of deliberation no longer arises; the theory has merely been applied outside its domain of interest.\n\n11. Relation to Other Puzzles\n\nThe same deliberation dependence arises in:\n\na) The \u201cTransparent Newcomb\u201d problem where seeing two boxes makes one\u2019s credence about what the predictor forecast hinge on whether one is reaching for one or two.  \nb) The \u201cAbstention\u201d variant of voting paradoxes where contemplating abstention changes the expected causal effect of a vote.  \nc) Sequential medical testing where each provisional intention to test or not test updates the chance that one\u2019s disease was previously caught.\n\nSeeing these as instances of a single structural weakness suggests a research programme: systematically classify scenarios where CDT\u2019s input probabilities depend on the agent\u2019s introspective state, and develop a unified replacement decision theory.\n\n12. Toward a Normative Constraint: Deliberation-Invariance\n\nA promising patch is to require:\n\nDeliberation-Invariance: A rational decision rule\u2019s recommendation must be invariant across belief states that differ only with respect to the agent\u2019s current, revisable probability for the very acts under consideration.\n\nCDT violates this constraint in DiD; policy-based theories satisfy it because the unit of evaluation is a deliberation-stable object (the policy).  If deliberation-invariance is accepted as a desideratum, CDT is normatively inadequate.\n\n13. Conclusion\n\nCDT\u2019s dependence on shifting act-probabilities in Death-in-Damascus cases is more than an oddity.  It yields unstable advice, enables exploitation, and contradicts CDT\u2019s motivating idea of attending solely to what one can causally influence.  Defenders can insulate CDT only by grafting on principles\u2014ratifiability, commitment devices, policy selection\u2014that either excise the very probabilities that cause trouble or else reconstrue the object of choice.  Once those moves are made, the resulting theory is no longer orthodox CDT.\n\nThe lesson is not merely that CDT mishandles one fanciful puzzle.  It is that a decision rule tied to single-act causal influence but blind to the evidential feedback from one\u2019s own epistemic state cannot hope to be deliberation-invariant in a world containing other predictors and mirror-like regularities.  Rational agency requires evaluating whole policies or algorithms whose causal fingerprints extend upstream.

Consequently\n\n(1) P(d) = r\u00b7P(D) + (1 \u2013 r)\u00b7P(A) + (b \u2013 \u00bd)\u00b7f(r, b, P(D)),\n\nwhere P(D) is your present credence that you will go to Damascus.  \nBecause P(d) feeds directly into the expected utility of each act, the CDT ranking of acts is itself a function of P(D).  As your credence about your own future move shifts while you deliberate, CDT\u2019s verdict about which move is utility-maximizing shifts with it.  The question before us is whether that dependence is a defect in Causal Decision Theory.  I shall argue that it is, for two interconnected reasons:\n\nThesis.  (i) Because CDT\u2019s expected-utility rankings vary continuously with the agent\u2019s unstable self-credences, the theory can fail to supply determinate action guidance to a perfectly informed but still deliberating agent; and (ii) the phenomenon reveals a deeper structural flaw\u2014CDT evaluates single acts in isolation when the real objects of control in predictor cases are policies or earlier decision algorithms.  Rectifying the flaw requires a reformulation of CDT, not merely better bookkeeping.\n\nThe route to this conclusion will be as follows.  Section 1 formalises the dependence on P(D) and exhibits the \u201cwandering recommendations\u201d phenomenon.  Section 2 argues that wandering recommendations deprive CDT of what a decision theory is for\u2014stable deliberative guidance.  Section 3 considers three prominent rejoinders and shows why each leaves the underlying problem intact.  Section 4 diagnoses the root of the trouble: CDT\u2019s act-centric, moment-by-moment perspective in contexts where what really matters is an earlier, policy-level causal node.  Section 5 sketches an updateless, policy-centred variant of CDT that escapes the instability while preserving the causal spirit.  The final section extracts two broader morals about the interface between causation, prediction, and rational choice.\n\n1.  The mathematics of shifting recommendations  \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nWrite r = .9 and b = .6 for concreteness.  Then, conditional on act A:\n\n    EU(A) = (1 \u2013 P(d)) \u00b7 0  +  P(d) \u00b7 (\u20131000)  = \u20131000\u00b7P(d).\n\nSimilarly,\n\n    EU(D) = \u20131000\u00b7(1 \u2013 P(d)).\n\nHence CDT recommends Aleppo iff P(d) > \u00bd, Damascus iff P(d) < \u00bd, and is indifferent at exactly \u00bd.  But by Bayes,\n\n    P(d) = r\u00b7P(D) + (1 \u2013 r)\u00b7P(A) + b \u2013 \u00bd.\n\nSubstituting and simplifying:\n\n    P(d) = (2r \u2013 1)\u00b7P(D) + b.\n\nWith r = .9 this gives\n\n    P(d) = .8\u00b7P(D) + .6.\n\nPlugging back, CDT recommends Aleppo whenever\n\n    .8\u00b7P(D) + .6 > \u00bd   \u21d2   P(D) > \u2013.125.\n\nSince P(D) is necessarily between 0 and 1, the inequality is always satisfied.  So in the numerical example CDT stably prefers Aleppo.  Why, then, the alleged problem?\n\nBecause the example can be tuned so that the crossing point falls inside (0,1).  Let r = .8, b = .6.  Now\n\n    P(d) = .6\u00b7P(D) + .6.\n\nCDT prefers Aleppo iff .6\u00b7P(D) + .6 > \u00bd, i.e. P(D) > \u20131/6 (always true).  Still no shift.  Push r farther down.  Set r = .55, b = .6:\n\n    P(d) = .1\u00b7P(D) + .6.\n\nCDT prefers Aleppo iff .1\u00b7P(D) + .6 > \u00bd   \u21d2   P(D) > \u20131.  Again, Aleppo.  What happened to the instability?\n\nIt surfaces once the bias b is less strong than the reliability advantage r confers on the accurate guess.  Let r = .9 as before but b = .4 (Death still slightly favours Damascus, but not by much).  Now\n\n    P(d) = .8\u00b7P(D) + .4,\n\nand CDT prefers Aleppo when P(D) > .125, Damascus when P(D) < .125.  If your initial hunch is that you\u2019ll end up in Damascus with probability, say, .20, CDT tells you to go to Aleppo.  The moment you take that advice seriously, your credence that you will in fact go to Damascus dips below the .125 threshold, flipping CDT\u2019s recommendation to Damascus\u2014leading you to revise your credence upward, which flips the recommendation back, and so on ad infinitum.  In the limit, no act is ratifiable: neither is the unique maximum of its own expected utility given that choosing it would alter the very credences on which that expectation was calculated.\n\n2.  Why wandering recommendations matter  \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nA decision rule is supposed to do two jobs:\n\nGuidance.  It should tell a deliberating agent what to do.  \nEvaluation.  It should vindicate or criticise acts after the fact.\n\nThe second job survives intact; CDT can still declare, of the person who ended up in Aleppo and lived, that her act had higher causal expected utility relative to the credences she in fact had at the last moment of choice.  The first job, however, is threatened.  When the act ranking is a continuous function of the agent\u2019s unstable self-credences, advice becomes self-frustrating.  No matter which option the agent tentatively resolves upon, CDT immediately announces that, given this very resolution, a different option is preferable.  The theory thus fails to output an answer that an ideally rational but finitely introspective deliberator could implement.\n\nThat failure is not a merely practical inconvenience.  A core selling point of CDT over Evidential Decision Theory (EDT) is its promise of dynamic coherence: because CDT conditions only on causal predecessors, it purportedly immunises the agent against the evidential blackmail and Newcombish traps that bedevil EDT.  Yet in Death\u2010in\u2010Damascus cases the causal independence of past prediction is precisely what drives the instability.  CDT therefore loses the guidance advantage it advertises.\n\n3.  Three attempted repairs  \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nRepair 1.  \u201cTreat P(D) as exogenous.\u201d  \nJoyce (2012) suggests that a rational agent should not regard P(D) as a free variable.  It is a belief about her own future act formed on the basis of self\u2010knowledge and background data.  As such it should be treated as a hard datum during the very act it describes; deliberation aims to discover, not to alter, what you are going to do.  If P(D) is fixed, the instability evaporates.\n\nReply.  Two problems.  First, the discovery model is psychologically implausible: we do in practice revise credences about our own future behaviour while reflecting on reasons.  Second, even stipulating fixity, CDT provides no criterion for which prior to fix.  An \u201cupdateless\u201d prior from the previous evening?  The first credence that occurs to you after reading the problem?  Unless some canonical choice is supplied, the prescription is indeterminate.\n\nRepair 2.  \u201cRandomise.\u201d  \nArntzenius (2008) proposes intentional mixing.  You can choose a lottery that sends you to Damascus with probability p.  Expected utility is now a continuous function of p over which you have direct control, and it has a maximum at a fixed point of the earlier equations.  Pick that p and the instability is resolved.\n\nReply.  Two objections.  (i) The availability of costless randomisation is an artificial assumption; one can run versions of the case where tossing coins is itself observable by Death or where randomisation is legally or physically impossible.  (ii) More importantly, the solution shifts CDT from an act evaluator to a mixed-strategy optimiser.  Once that move is on the table, nothing prevents an evidentialist from making the same move, so CDT\u2019s distinctive selling point again disappears.\n\nRepair 3.  \u201cEmbed CDT in an extensive form.\u201d  \nSkyrms (1996) treats the predictor as part of a larger game between you and Death.  Solve for the equilibrium of the game, and the recommendation emerges.  Typically the unique subgame\u2010perfect equilibrium is \u201cgo wherever Death guessed you would,\u201d restoring stability.\n\nReply.  But CDT\u2019s original mandate was to decide what a lone agent ought to do given her causal beliefs, not to recommend equilibria of an intertemporal game she does not consciously play.  The game-formulation changes the subject: it smuggles in strategic considerations that CDT, as ordinarily stated, does not countenance.\n\n4.  The deeper diagnosis: act-centrism in predictor problems  \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nWhy does CDT stumble precisely where its causal scruples should help?  Because the theory chooses too late.  The causal graph of a Death-in-Damascus scenario looks like this:\n\nEarlier psychological state S  \u2192  Death\u2019s prediction P  \n                     \u2193                    \u2193  \n              later action A        outcome (live/die)\n\nBoth P and A are downstream of S.  From the perspective of the time-slice at which you already know that P has occurred (though not its content), A and P are probabilistically but not causally linked.  CDT, in evaluating A, keeps the distribution over P fixed.  Unfortunately that distribution is itself a function of the distribution over S, and S includes whatever decision algorithm you are currently running.  By altering the algorithm, you alter P, even though by the lights of the current time-slice A cannot causally influence P.  CDT\u2019s prohibition on conditioning on A blinds the agent to the fact that, one time-slice up, altering her algorithm would indeed have screened off the correlation.  The instability is a symptom of that blindness.\n\nPut differently: the decision you control is not merely \u201cA or D now\u201d but \u201cwhich algorithm shall I have been running all along?\u201d  Once that earlier node is recognised as the locus of genuine control, the correlation between prediction and act is comfortably causal after all, and the dependence on unstable credences disappears.\n\n5.  Updateless Policy CDT (UPCDT)  \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nUPCDT proceeds in three stages:\n\nStage 1:  Prior.  Before you learn the content of the predictor\u2019s guess, fix a probability distribution over the full causal network.\n\nStage 2:  Policy choice.  Evaluate entire input\u2010output policies\u2014functions from possible observations to acts\u2014by the expected utility they would have given Stage-1 credences, holding fixed only the physical facts not causally downstream of the policy node.  One policy is: \u201cIf I find myself in the Death-in-Damascus set-up, go to Aleppo.\u201d  Another is: \u201cGo wherever I currently believe I am less likely to go.\u201d  Compute expected utility for each.\n\nStage 3:  Implementation.  Upon arrival in the diagnostic situation, execute the act mandated by the previously chosen policy without re-deliberating at the act level.\n\nUPCDT is resolutely causal: when scoring a policy it holds constant the prior probabilities of nodes that the policy cannot causally influence.  But because the policy is selected at the point where your algorithm branches, it properly treats the correlation between prediction and final act as downstream of the policy.  The result is a unique policy ranking that does not shift as your moment-to-moment credences flutter.  In typical parameter settings, \u201cAlways go to Aleppo\u201d strictly dominates, and the instability never arises.\n\n6.  Two morals and a coda  \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFirst moral.  In predictor cases the unit of rational control is not the isolated act but the earlier algorithm that produces both the act and the predictor\u2019s correlated state.  Any decision theory that ignores this temporal binding will mis-identify which probabilities are truly exogenous and will risk recommendation instability.\n\nSecond moral.  Guidance and evaluation pull apart if your decision rule takes as input a quantity (like P(D)) that the very act of following the rule predictably perturbs.  To secure guidance, a theory must guarantee what Skyrms calls \u201cratifiability\u201d: the chosen act (or policy) must remain optimal conditional on the fact that it is chosen.  Act-centred CDT fails that guarantee in Death-type set-ups; policy-centred variants succeed.\n\nCoda.  Does all this vindicate Evidential Decision Theory?  Not directly.  EDT, too, can be reformulated at the policy level (as \u201cUpdateless EDT\u201d), and when so reformulated it shares the same recommendations as UPCDT in Death-in-Damascus.  The upshot is not that causation is irrelevant.  It is that the distinction between causal and evidential conditioning does its normative work only when applied at the right temporal grain.  Shift your focus from isolated acts to earlier algorithmic choices, and the quarrel between the two theories looks less like a fight about which probabilities to enter into the utility formula and more like a subtler dispute about which counterfactuals represent genuine control.\n\nConclusion.  CDT\u2019s dependence on deliberational act probabilities is indeed a problem\u2014not because it relies on subjective credences per se, but because in predictor scenarios those credences are endogenous to the very choice being made.  The resulting feedback loop robs CDT of stable guidance.  A policy-level, updateless reconstruction restores that guidance and reveals that the real lesson of Death in Damascus is about the temporal location of agency, not about the pros and cons of causal versus evidential conditioning.", "output_tokens": 4462, "reasoning_tokens": 1344}

Setting the stage  \n\nCausal Decision Theory (CDT) tells an agent to maximise expected utility with probabilities computed by the \u201ccausal do\u2010operator\u201d: P(state | do(act)).  States that lie outside the future light-cone of the contemplated act are to be treated as causally independent of it, so their probabilities should not be altered when one counterfactually intervenes on the act.  In ordinary choice problems\u2014choosing apples over oranges, keeping or discarding a lottery ticket\u2014that rule behaves well.  But in the Death in Damascus family of cases the act\u2019s expected utility is a function of the probability the agent currently assigns to performing that very act.  During deliberation those probabilities shift, and with them CDT\u2019s recommendation.  The question is whether this self-referential dependence is an embarrassment for CDT.\n\nMy thesis: the dependence is not a merely technical quirk; it exposes a deep instability in CDT\u2019s guidance.  In Death in Damascus, CDT fails to deliver a recommendation that is (i) deliberationally stable, (ii) dynamically consistent, and (iii) compatible with the very causal-statistical picture from which CDT draws its authority.  Two consequences follow.  First, an agent who tries to be a \u201cCDT-ist\u201d can be money-pumped or forced into endless vacillation.  Second, the underlying cause of the instability generalises: whenever an upstream predictor tracks deliberative states, CDT\u2019s machinery yields advice that predictably disintegrates.  A satisfactory decision theory must therefore move to a level on which an agent evaluates policies, algorithms, or dispositions, not momentary acts conditioned on their shifting credences.  Functional Decision Theory (FDT), \u201cupdateless\u201d CDT, or policy-based causal reasoning offer ways to repair the flaw, but orthodox CDT taken straight cannot.\n\n2. Reconstructing Death in Damascus carefully  \n\nHere is a slightly formalised version that brings out the dependence on act probabilities.\n\n\u2022 Background facts  \n   \u2013 Death is a superb but fallible psychologist.  \n   \u2013 He consults your \u201cmental file\u201d at t\u2080 and travels to whichever city he then predicts you will visit the next day at t\u2081.  \n   \u2013 If you meet Death you lose 100 utiles; otherwise you lose nothing.  \n   \u2013 Travel costs are negligible.\n\n\u2022 Probabilities you hold at t\u2080.  Let p be your current subjective probability of choosing Damascus (D); 1\u2212p is the probability of choosing Aleppo (A).  Death\u2019s reliability is 90%, but he has a base-rate preference for placing himself in Damascus when unsure.  Concretely,\n\n   P(Death in D | you end up in D)  = 0.9  \n   P(Death in D | you end up in A)  = 0.6  \n\n(Because of the base-rate bias, the conditional probability that Death is in Damascus goes down when you assign more mass to A.)\n\n\u2022 Expected utilities according to CDT at t\u2080.  CDT instructs you to compute P(Death in city | do(act)), i.e. treating the act as an intervention that severs all incoming causal arrows.  Since your eventual act is (plausibly) not a cause of Death\u2019s earlier prediction, the conditional probabilities above are left intact.  Hence\n\n   EU(D) = \u2212100 \u00d7 0.9 = \u221290  \n   EU(A) = \u2212100 \u00d7 0.6 = \u221260  \n\nSo CDT recommends Aleppo\u2014if your p is still the old p.  But note what happens if, during deliberation, you decide you are very likely to go to Aleppo after all.  Your internal credence p falls from, say, 0.4 to 0.1.  That change reduces the base-rate part of Death\u2019s bias toward Damascus.  Conditional on \u201cI am the kind of person who is 90% likely to go to Aleppo\u201d, your best estimate becomes\n\n   P(Death in D | you end up in D) \u2248 0.97  \n   P(Death in D | you end up in A) \u2248 0.11.  \n\nPlugging these into CDT\u2019s formula now yields\n\n   EU(D) = \u2212100 \u00d7 0.97 \u2248 \u221297  \n   EU(A) = \u2212100 \u00d7 0.11 \u2248 \u221211,  \n\nso Aleppo is still favoured but by a wider margin.  Suppose, however, that Death\u2019s bias were even stronger.  In some parameter ranges the update flips the recommendation: as your credence in Damascus shrinks, the disadvantage of D grows, until the expected utilities cross; CDT then tells you to go back to Damascus.  The very act of deciding destabilises the inputs into the decision.\n\n3. Why dependence on p is philosophically troubling  \n\n3.1 No deliberational fixed point  \n\nA decision rule worth following must have what Jeffrey called \u201cdeliberational stability\u201d: if you begin to run the rule, its verdict should not be undermined by learning facts that are feedback products of the rule\u2019s own operation.  CDT fails that test here.  The function f mapping \u201ccurrent p\u201d to \u201crecommended act\u201d has no fixed point.  Start with p=0.5; CDT tells you \u201cGo Aleppo\u201d; you update p downward; f now tells you \u201cGo Damascus\u201d; you update back; f flips again.  The agent can ping-pong forever or until bounded rationality arbitrarily halts the process.  That is a sign of a defective prescription rather than mere incompleteness in a theory of rational belief change.\n\n3.2 Dynamic inconsistency and money pumps  \n\nSuppose your dialectical pendulum slows enough that you actually board the Aleppo bus.  En route you recall that were you now to jump off and taxi back to Damascus Death would almost surely remain in Aleppo (he already left), yielding a higher expected utility.  CDT therefore reverses itself after the ticket has been bought.  A wily ticket-seller could exploit this by offering infinitesimally priced switches between buses, extracting an unlimited sum\u2014an analogue of the \u201cDutch book\u201d but in decision rather than belief space.  Any decision theory that is exploitable by predictable, costless offers falls afoul of widely accepted rationality desiderata.\n\n3.3 The causal model rebels  \n\nAt first glance CDT can insist, \u201cDeath\u2019s location is causally prior, so do\u2010interventions leave its probability unchanged.\u201d  But the practical perspective reveals a mismatch between the formal severing of arrows and the lived epistemic situation.  The only reason the probability tables above contain the skewed values (.9, .6, etc.) is that Death\u2019s earlier act is statistically responsive to stable features of your decision procedure.  Intervening to change only the output of that very procedure while holding fixed everything upstream is an ill-defined surgical fantasy.  In Pearl\u2019s terms, \u201csoft interventions\u201d that rewrite the value of a downstream variable without touching the mechanism that normally determines it can be metaphysically coherent yet pragmatically useless if the mechanism encodes the very information that made the probabilities what they are.  The dependence on p is an empirical symptom of that deeper incoherence.  CDT attempts to use do-calculus in a setting in which the appropriate causal graph contains a node for \u201cdecision function F\u201d that itself determines the act.  Treating do(act) as primitive bypasses F and yields paradox.\n\n4. Objections and attempted repairs  \n\nObjection 1: \u201cRational credences in one\u2019s own act should be 0 or 1; you eventually see what you will do, eliminating p-dependence.\u201d  \nReply: That view confuses knowledge that you will decide with advance certainty about which decision you will reach.  Serious deliberation is precisely the process of resolving a state of indeterminacy.  Denying that intermediate credences exist trivialises the decision problem and abandons the predictive explanation of Death\u2019s reliability.\n\nObjection 2: \u201cAdopt a ratification constraint: perform an act only if you would endorse it upon learning that you do in fact perform it.\u201d  \nReply: Ratifiability cuts the knot in some cases but here yields underspecification.  Both \u201calways Damascus\u201d and \u201calways Aleppo\u201d are ratifiable, as are mixed strategies, so the theory trades one instability for an arbitrary selection problem.  Moreover, adding ratification is to revise, not defend, core CDT.\n\nObjection 3: \u201cThe dependence on p is harmless because it disappears once decision costs are accounted for; endless vacillation is never free.\u201d  \nReply: Cost can damp oscillation but does nothing about the normative question of what ought to be chosen given a single, costless opportunity.  A rationality notion that relies on external friction to work cannot claim foundational adequacy.\n\nObjection 4: \u201cA more fine-grained causal graph, on which do(act) does alter upstream beliefs about Death\u2019s prediction, salvages CDT.\u201d  \nReply: If do(act) is allowed to influence Death\u2019s earlier choice via the common cause \u2018decision function\u2019, CDT ceases to be purely causal and collapses into something closer to Functional Decision Theory.  That route is promising but amounts to abandoning the orthodox version under discussion.\n\n5. A positive direction: policy evaluation rather than act evaluation  \n\nThe diagnosis suggests a remedy: freeze the feedback loop by evaluating policies\u2014mathematically, functions from informational states to acts\u2014instead of evaluating individual acts relative to shifting credences.  Let \u03c0 be the policy \u201calways go to Aleppo.\u201d  The ex ante expected utility of \u03c0 is \u221260.  The policy \u201calways go to Damascus\u201d yields \u221290.  Mixed or stochastic policies have intermediate values.  Because one\u2019s credence about implementing \u03c0 is 1 (the policy is self-advertising), Death\u2019s prediction probabilities become fixed once \u03c0 is fixed, and deliberational instability disappears.  Crucially, the ranking of policies is p-independent.  Choosing the best policy, then executing it, is dynamically consistent.\n\nThis move is precisely what Functional Decision Theory and Updateless CDT formalise.  They agree with orthodox CDT on standard Newcomb cases in which the predictor keys directly off the algorithm, but they do not suffer the vacillation pathologies.  In short, the dependence of act expected utility on p is a problem for CDT because the theory\u2019s fundamental object of evaluation is mis-chosen.\n\n6. Generalising the lesson  \n\nAny scenario with the following structure will break CDT in the same way:\n\n   (i) An upstream predictor P observes some correlate of your decision algorithm.  \n   (ii) Outcomes depend on P\u2019s prediction matching your eventual act.  \n   (iii) During deliberation your credences about your own act shift, feeding back into the conditional distribution of P\u2019s action.\n\nExamples include:  \n\u2022 The \u201cXOR blackmail\u201d puzzle where paying the blackmailer depends on whether you are predicted to pay;  \n\u2022 Transparent Newcomb with small box penalties;  \n\u2022 Sophisticated adversaries in cyber-security who prepare defences depending on forecasts of your specific exploit path.\n\nIn all these cases, CDT\u2019s act-by-act evaluation yields cycles, whereas a policy-level CDT (or FDT) yields a single, stable recommendation.\n\n7. Conclusion  \n\nDependence of expected utilities on one\u2019s current act probabilities is not an innocuous by-product of CDT; it is a symptom of a deeper misalignment between the theory\u2019s causal counterfactuals and the epistemic realities of prediction-sensitive environments.  The resulting lack of deliberational fixed points, exposure to money pumps, and implicit reliance on an untenable \u201csurgical\u201d interpretation of do(act) collectively indict orthodox CDT.  The cure lies in shifting the unit of evaluation upward\u2014from momentary acts to abstract decision policies that are self-locating in the causal fabric.  That shift preserves CDT\u2019s causal spirit while escaping the Death in Damascus trap; without it, CDT is indeed in mortal danger.", "output_tokens": 3403, "reasoning_tokens": 896}

Introduction and Thesis\n\nHow tightly must an agent\u2019s heart be tethered to the concrete beneficiaries of her action for that action to have moral worth? Common wisdom\u2014invoking charges of \u201cmoral fetishism\u201d (Williams) or \u201calienation\u201d (Stocker)\u2014says: very tightly indeed. On this view a person who saves a drowning child merely because \u201cit is the right thing to do\u201d lacks full-blooded concern for the child; the motivational distance diminishes the act\u2019s praiseworthiness. I shall argue that this common wisdom is mistaken. A de dicto desire to do what is morally right can, by itself, suffice for moral worth. What makes such purely dutiful action praiseworthy is not affective proximity to the child but (i) the agent\u2019s robust rational sensitivity to the right\u2010making features of situations, and (ii) her commitment to guide herself by those features because they are right\u2010making\u2014that is, because she respects moral reasons as such. Far from being fetishistic, this posture expresses an agent\u2019s practical identity as a self-governing moral person. When successful, it manifests a distinctive virtue: respect for morality. My aim is not to deny the moral beauty of concern or empathy, but to vindicate a parallel path to moral worth available even to the austere moralist.\n\n2. Clarifying the Terrain\n\nTwo distinctions will structure the debate.\n\na. De dicto vs. de re motivation. An agent acts from a de re moral motive when she desires to alleviate that child\u2019s suffering, or to keep a promise to Pat: her desire latches onto the very property that makes the act right (reduce suffering, fidelity). A de dicto motive, by contrast, is a second\u2010order desire: to perform whatever act is morally right, whatever that happens to be in the circumstance.\n\nb. Moral rightness vs. moral lawfulness. \u201cDoing what is morally right\u201d can be read either as \u201cdoing what the correct moral principles require\u201d or as \u201cdoing what happens, as a matter of fact, to be morally necessary.\u201d I use the latter: rightness is a property of acts, not merely their conformity to a code the agent endorses.\n\nThe skeptic\u2019s conclusion is that de dicto motivation alone cannot yield moral worth. Their argument (sketched roughly) runs:\n\n(1) Praiseworthy action must be motivated by what morality is really about\u2014namely, the concrete values or persons implicated.  \n(2) Purely de dicto motivation bypasses those concrete considerations.  \n(3) Therefore such motivation cannot supply moral worth.\n\nCall this the \u201caboutness argument.\u201d\n\n3. Why the Standard Objection Overstates Its Case\n\nThe aboutness argument conflates two views:\n\nInternal Claim: For an act to be right, it must be explained by certain facts (the child\u2019s danger, promisee\u2019s reliance).\n\nPsychological Claim: For an act to be morally worthy, those very facts must be the agent\u2019s motivating reasons.\n\nOnly the psychological claim is at issue; (1) slides illicitly from the internal to the psychological domain. An agent can acknowledge that the drowning child\u2019s stake explains the act\u2019s rightness while nevertheless being causally moved by a rational commitment to do whatever such stakes morally require. After all, \u201cI should do whatever those stakes require\u201d is itself a way of relating to the stakes: a way that runs through reflective endorsement rather than spontaneous emotion.\n\n4. The Positive Account: Respect Responsiveness\n\nI propose that de dicto motivation generates moral worth provided that it realizes what I call Respect Responsiveness:\n\nRR: An agent acts with moral worth iff she (a) is disposed to track what the right-making considerations are across relevantly close situations, and (b) chooses the act she sincerely takes to be right because she recognizes those considerations as morally authoritative.\n\nCrucially, clause (b) does not say the considerations must be the occurrent cause of action; it says the agent must regard them as the source of authority. The de dicto desire \u201cdo the right thing\u201d is therefore not empty. It is a higher-order policy that licenses first-order action precisely by treating the right-making considerations as decisive. Moral respect is thus a distinct virtue, analogous to scientific intellectual honesty: what earns a physicist praise is her determination to follow the empirical evidence wherever it leads, not the fact that she has a personal fondness for quarks.\n\n5. Why Respect Responsiveness Is Not Fetishistic\n\nFetish objects are valued utterly apart from the properties that made them significant in the first place. But the morally respectful agent values an act precisely as embodying \u201cwhatever it is that makes things right.\u201d If she were reliably insensitive to those underlying properties, she would fail clause (a). The fetish charge bites only at caricatures\u2014agents who treat \u201crightness\u201d as a magic label detachable from the facts that ground it. But such detachment is excluded by RR\u2019s tracking condition. Indeed, the dutiful agent is sensitive in a modality that empathy alone cannot guarantee: she cares not just that this child be saved but that any person, in any context, receive the consideration morality demands.\n\n6. Comparison with Kant and Contemporary Defenses\n\nKant speaks of reverence for the moral law. Recent Kantian interpreters (e.g., Tamar Schapiro, Sergio Tenenbaum) insist that reverence can coexist with full recognition of material values. My account agrees but adds a reliability condition reminiscent of virtue epistemology: moral worth tracks rightness across counterfactuals. This enables us to address a classic worry. Suppose the agent mistakenly believes donating to a scam charity is obligatory. Her de dicto desire moves her to do \u201cthe right thing,\u201d but she misidentifies it. On my view, she lacks moral worth because she fails component (a): the relevant counterfactuals (had she investigated minimal evidence) would still have led her astray. Moral respect involves competent sensitivity, not mere intention.\n\n7. Examples Doing Philosophical Work\n\nExample 1: The Stoic Lifeguard. Marta has trained herself to remain emotionally even-keeled; she does not feel empathic surges. A child falls into rough surf. Marta\u2019s internal dialogue: \u201cMorally, I must rescue anyone in grave danger if I can do so without comparable risk.\u201d She dives in and saves the child with practiced efficiency. The standard view calls her alienated; she seems admirable but cold. Yet Marta satisfies RR: she tracks the right-making features (serious peril, minimal cost to herself) and acts because they are morally decisive. Her absence of affect is neither here nor there.\n\nExample 2: The Exhausted Nurse. Tai, after a 14-hour shift, notices his patient\u2019s pain medication will lapse in five minutes. All he feels is fatigue; nothing in him wells up for the patient. What galvanizes him is the disciplined thought, \u201cI promised that every patient would receive care in a timely manner; it is right to honor that promise.\u201d Tai sets the IV. The promisee\u2019s welfare is protected, though Tai\u2019s motive is sheer fidelity to rightness. Intuitively we still owe him praise. Indeed, given his exhaustion, his respect for duty is especially admirable: it forestalls moral slippage where sentiment would wane.\n\nThese cases are not Platonic fables; they map actual domains\u2014military ethics, medicine, law\u2014where de dicto commitment sustains conduct precisely when empathy fatigues.\n\n8. Addressing Deep Objections\n\nObjection A: Alienation revisited\u2014Surely the moral life is partly about standing in caring relations.  \n\nReply: I grant that robust moral excellence includes relational virtues. But moral worth is scalar and plural. A chess player merits praise for positional foresight even if she lacks tactical flair; analogously, respect-responsiveness earns moral credit even where care is absent. The skeptic conflates \u201csufficient\u201d with \u201coptimal.\u201d\n\nObjection B: De dicto motivation is too abstract to guide without hidden concrete desires.  \n\nReply: Guidance vs. initiation. The dutiful agent still needs factual beliefs to specify which act token is right; but the motivational engine is the higher-order desire. Autonomy often proceeds this way: my desire to honor a contract motivates me, although I must also represent the contract\u2019s clauses to know what to do.\n\nObjection C: Doesn\u2019t RR smuggle in the very de re concern it claimed to replace, by requiring sensitivity to right-making facts?  \n\nReply: No. RR requires epistemic sensitivity, not motivational content. Compare a reliable thermometer: it tracks temperature without \u201ccaring\u201d about warmth. Similarly, the dutiful agent\u2019s caring is directed at rightness, not at each beneficiary. The tracking condition safeguards correctness, not emotional texture.\n\n9. Distinguishing Moral Worth from Moral Beauty\n\nPart of the dialectic trades on an equivocation between praiseworthiness (desert of moral credit) and attractiveness (the virtue we find endearing). A soldier who defuses mines because she \u201cswore an oath to protect civilians\u201d may not ooze tenderness, yet she deserves moral admiration. By segregating these two dimensions we can concede that de re motives contribute to moral beauty, while insisting that de dicto motives suffice for moral worth.\n\n10. The Normative Payoff: Autonomy and Universality\n\nA final advantage of my view is that it honors two ideals many theories cherish:\n\na. Autonomy. The agent governs herself by principles she reflectively endorses. Emotional empathy is serendipitous; respect-responsiveness is chosen.\n\nb. Universality. Concrete affections cluster parochially (family, compatriots). De dicto respect scales readily: whoever falls under the moral principle\u2019s scope is owed compliance.\n\nThus, vindicating de dicto sufficiency does not merely patch a corner case; it reveals a powerful channel through which ordinary agents realize core moral ideals.\n\n11. Relation to Empirical Psychology\n\nEmpirical studies (e.g., Daniel Batson on altruism) show that empathic concern is statistically unreliable across diffuse victims; moral identity centrality, by contrast, predicts rule-consistent helping even in anonymous contexts. Respect-responsiveness thus maps onto motivational patterns already observed to sustain pro-social behavior where empathy is silent\u2014supporting, albeit indirectly, my claim that such responsiveness has independent moral value.\n\n12. Taking Stock\n\nI have argued:\n\n1. The standard \u201caboutness\u201d objection mislocates the deficit: it confuses explanatory with motivational roles.  \n2. Moral worth hinges on Respect Responsiveness, which a purely de dicto motive can instantiate.  \n3. Such motivation need not be fetishistic, provided the agent tracks right-making features competently.  \n4. Examples from real-world institutional life illustrate the point.  \n5. Critics\u2019 deepest worries relate to moral beauty or relational intimacy, not to praiseworthiness per se.\n\n13. Conclusion\n\nOne need not wear one\u2019s heart on one\u2019s sleeve to merit moral praise. The person who acts solely from a de dicto desire to do what is right manifests a distinctive moral virtue: standing under the authority of moral reasons as such. When that virtue is connected, through competent deliberation, to the features that actually make acts right, the resulting conduct possesses moral worth\u2014even if no warm sentiment courses through the agent\u2019s veins. Far from evincing alienation, de dicto motivation honors the fundamental point of morality: that what ultimately matters is not whom we happen to care about, but whether we successfully respond to the reasons we objectively have. Acting from duty, then, is not a pale substitute for compassion; it is a robust, autonomous, and praise-deserving mode of moral agency in its own right.", "output_tokens": 2937, "reasoning_tokens": 448}

Introduction and Thesis  \n\nThe prevailing objection to Kant\u2019s famous claim that only actions done \u201cfrom duty\u201d have moral worth is that a merely de dicto concern\u2014\u201cdo the morally right thing, whatever that is\u201d\u2014looks bloodless. A good person, the thought goes, rescues the child because the child is in peril, not because a moral principle somewhere issues the command \u201crescue!\u201d  I argue that this criticism presupposes an unduly thin picture of what a de dicto desire to do what is right can be. Once we notice the cognitive and volitional complexity that can be packed into such a desire, it becomes clear that acting solely from duty can in many cases suffice for full moral worth.  \n\nMy positive proposal has two parts. (i) A de dicto moral motive can be morally substantial rather than fetishistic when it functions as a higher-order regulative commitment that organizes and sustains the agent\u2019s first-order deliberation. (ii) Such a motive is praiseworthy because it manifests a form of respect for practical reason itself\u2014a respect that equips the agent to respond correctly across an open-ended range of moral situations, including hard cases in which no single concrete consideration is salient enough to carry the deliberative day. I call this the \u201cRegulative Respect\u201d account.  \n\n2. Clarifying the Target: De Dicto vs. De Re Motives  \n\nWe need sharper distinctions than the literature usually draws. Let us call:  \n\n\u2022 A de re moral motive: a desire whose content is a specific right-making feature F (e.g., \u201cthe child will drown unless I jump\u201d).  \n\u2022 A de dicto moral motive: a desire whose content is simply \u201cdo what is morally right,\u201d without yet specifying the right-making feature.  \n\nCritics such as Michael Stocker (\u201cThe Schizophrenia of Modern Ethical Theories\u201d), Susan Wolf (\u201cMoral Saints\u201d), and Peter Railton (\u201cAlienation, Consequentialism, and the Demands of Morality\u201d) treat the de dicto motive as thin and motivationally deficient. Yet they overlook a further distinction between:  \n\n(a) A superficial de dicto desire\u2014e.g., the student who says, \u201cI guess I\u2019ll do what\u2019s right, whatever\u201d but has no idea how to identify it, and  \n\n(b) A regulative de dicto commitment that governs an agent\u2019s deliberation in a way that is epistemically responsible and substantively responsive to evidence about concrete moral features.  \n\nOnly (b) is my target. Critics have shown that (a) is inadequate; they have not refuted (b).  \n\n3. Why the Standard Objections Miss Their Mark  \n\n3.1 The Fetishism Charge  \n\nIn Liam Murphy\u2019s terminology, a fetishistic agent treats morality \u201cas an object of intrinsic fascination,\u201d caring more about moral status than about people. But fetishism requires *substitution*: the agent substitutes the property of rightness for the properties that make the act right, treating the former as if it had independent normative force. The regulative de dicto motive involves no such substitution. The agent directs her will toward acting on whatever reasons there are, precisely because she recognizes that those reasons are what ultimately matter\u2014even if at the moment of action she cannot specify them individually. Rather than displacing first-order reasons, she takes up a standing second-order policy to respect them.  \n\n3.2 The Alienation Charge  \n\nRailton complains that a morality dominated by de dicto considerations alienates us from our personal projects and the people we love. But the regulative desire I defend is compatible with rich first-order attachments. It functions like a moral gyroscope: it keeps the agent stably oriented toward rightness while allowing local motives\u2014love, friendship, creativity\u2014to supply specific content whenever they are consistent with morality. Where conflict arises, the de dicto motive takes precedence, but that is a feature, not a bug: it prevents partiality from devolving into injustice.  \n\n3.3 The Schizophrenia Charge  \n\nStocker holds that modern ethical theories split motives from reasons, rendering ordinary moral psychology \u201cschizophrenic.\u201d Yet a regulative de dicto desire *integrates* the two. The agent\u2019s standing commitment to rightness ensures that her motives track her reasons across time, rather than leaving the connection to chance.  \n\n4. A Positive Model: Regulative Respect  \n\nThe central idea is borrowed from hierarchical theories of agency (Frankfurt, Railton, Hieronymi): practical identity is structured by higher-order commitments that regulate first-order impulses. Respect for morality is one such higher-order commitment. But unlike Frankfurtian volitional necessity, the commitment here is rational and revisable: the agent holds herself answerable to moral reasons precisely because she sees herself as a participant in the practice of giving and asking for reasons (to adapt Brandom).  \n\nRegulative Respect has three components:  \n\n(1) Epistemic Orientation: The agent treats moral facts as discoverable but fallible. She actively seeks evidence about what morality requires.  \n\n(2) Volitional Priority: When the agent judges that \u03c6 is morally required, that judgment is decisive in action unless outweighed by defeating reasons she has overlooked.  \n\n(3) Correctibility: The agent is disposed to revise both her first-order judgment \u03c6 and her higher-order principle if better moral reasoning or testimony indicates error.  \n\nThese components ensure that the agent is *responsive* to the very right-making features that critics think she ignores, albeit indirectly. Responsiveness is mediated by, but not replaced by, the higher-order commitment.  \n\n5. Two Test Cases  \n\nExample 1: Moral Uncertainty at the Triage Tent  \n\nA battlefield nurse must decide, under severe time pressure, whether to allocate the only available ventilator to Soldier A or Soldier B. She cannot attend to the full array of morally relevant details (probabilities of survival, responsibility for injury, prior service). What she can do, and does, is act on a standing policy: \u201cDo the action that accords with the morally best rule I have most reason to believe applies under uncertainty,\u201d e.g., a lottery between equal claims. She implements the lottery *because* she is committed to doing what morality requires, not because she takes delight in spinning wheels. Her action is morally worthy precisely because the de dicto motive allows action guided by fairness in circumstances where concrete de re motives are epistemically inaccessible.  \n\nExample 2: The Newly Enlightened Reformer  \n\nConsider an affluent heir who has recently come to believe\u2014through reading Iris Marion Young or Amartya Sen\u2014that inherited wealth is unjust in a world of severe deprivation. He writes a large check to an effective-altruist fund. The immediate motive is: \u201cThis is morally required.\u201d He does *not* yet feel special concern for distant children, nor does he find pleasure in giving. Still, we (and he) regard the donation as praiseworthy. What makes it so is that his higher-order respect for morality overrides prior self-interest and orients him toward justice; in time, concrete empathetic concern may follow, but moral worth does not await its arrival.  \n\n6. Why De Dicto Suffices: Three Independent Arguments  \n\n6.1 The Argument from Agency  \n\nMorality, whatever its substance, claims *practical authority*. To treat that authority as reason-giving in its own right is to relate to morality in the agency-constituting way characteristic of rational beings. An agent who wills an action because it is morally required is thereby expressing the right kind of agency. Therefore such an action has moral worth, absent defeating conditions.  \n\n6.2 The Argument from Reliability  \n\nSuppose (with Arpaly and Schroeder) that an action\u2019s moral worth depends on how reliably the agent\u2019s motivational structure produces right action across varying contexts. A standing commitment to rightness\u2014especially when coupled with the three Regulative Respect components\u2014is an excellent reliability mechanism. By contrast, a patchwork of isolated de re motives may track rightness in familiar circumstances but fail in novel ones. Therefore, de dicto motivation is at least as good a candidate for moral worth as any set of local motives.  \n\n6.3 The Non-Fungibility Argument  \n\nSome moral demands cannot be cashed out fully in first-order terms. Consider the demand to \u201ctreat each person as an equal.\u201d The norm is abstract, yet it applies ahead of any specific welfare interest or relationship. A motive that *recognizes* and *respects* that abstract equality is precisely a de dicto moral motive. If moral worth required exclusively de re motives, we could never act worthily when the moral demand itself is abstract. Therefore de dicto motivation must suffice at least in such cases.  \n\n7. Objections and Replies  \n\nObjection 1: The view licenses cold, calculative moralism that disrespects personal projects.  \nReply: Regulative Respect requires epistemic humility\u2014attentiveness to particularities\u2014for its implementation. Someone who bulldozes personal projects has failed the epistemic orientation and correctibility conditions; her stance is not one of genuine respect for moral reasons but of dogmatism.  \n\nObjection 2: The view collapses into Kant\u2019s, and we know Kant faces Scho\u0308n/bo\u0308se will problems.  \nReply: Kant indeed values acting \u201cfrom duty,\u201d but he conflates the regulative and the motivational levels: for him the *object* of the will is duty itself. My view separates them: the object of choice is still the concrete act; \u201cduty\u201d names the agent\u2019s higher-order policy of practical deference to moral reasons. Thus we resist both fetishism and Kant\u2019s rigorism.  \n\nObjection 3: Moral education suggests the contrary; we train children to care about others, not about \u201crightness.\u201d  \nReply: Developmentally, cultivating de re motives comes first because it is cognitively simpler. Precisely for that reason, growing moral maturity requires the further step of a de dicto commitment that can adjudicate among competing de re motives when they conflict. The argument is not developmental but structural: both forms of motive are valuable, but the de dicto is indispensable for adult agency under conditions of pluralism and uncertainty.  \n\n8. Comparative Assessment  \n\nLet us locate Regulative Respect relative to three prominent views.  \n\n\u2022 Kantian Internalism: Shares the idea that moral worth flows from respect for the moral law, but avoids Kant\u2019s formalism by embedding respect in a broader deliberative ecology that includes empirical evidence and revisability.  \n\n\u2022 Aristotelian Particularism: Shares the emphasis on sensitivity to particulars, but explains that sensitivity as the downstream effect of a higher-order commitment; thereby preserves moral unity across cases that exceed the grasp of phron\u0113sis alone.  \n\n\u2022 Sentimentalist Accounts (e.g., Humean, Nussbaumian): Acknowledges the motivational force of emotions but denies that emotions exhaust moral worth, which also depends on how the agent regulates emotions in light of reflective endorsement of moral reasons.  \n\n9. Broader Payoffs: Autonomy, Community, and Moral Progress  \n\nBecause the regulative commitment is correctible, it opens space for moral learning and collective deliberation. Agents disposed to act from duty in my sense are ideal interlocutors in public moral discourse: they hold their own judgments provisionally, they revise in light of new evidence, and they integrate concrete concerns into an overarching commitment to justice. Such agents are thus not just individually praiseworthy; they are the backbone of moral progress.  \n\n10. Conclusion  \n\nActing solely from a desire to do what is morally right can indeed suffice for moral worth, **provided** the desire functions as a higher-order, epistemically responsible, and correctible commitment\u2014Regulative Respect. What makes such dutiful action praiseworthy is not its abstraction but its role in expressing a distinctive form of practical agency: one that gives morality pride of place while remaining open to the concrete values that make morality worth caring about in the first place. De dicto motivation, far from being a moral fetish, is the glue that holds our diverse first-order concerns together in a coherent life of respect for persons.", "output_tokens": 2938, "reasoning_tokens": 384}

Introduction and Thesis  \nA perennial worry in moral psychology holds that the naked desire \u201cto do what is morally right\u201d is too thin a reed to sustain genuine moral worth.  If an agent salutes the abstraction \u201cmorality\u201d while remaining motivationally indifferent to the concrete considerations that make her act right\u2014another\u2019s pain, an avoidable injustice, an urgent need\u2014many critics think her agency is at best second-rate, at worst fetishistic.  I shall argue, to the contrary, that acting solely from a de dicto desire to do what is morally right can\u2014under certain recognizable conditions\u2014confer full moral worth.  What makes such action praiseworthy is not sentimental resonance with the right-making features but the agent\u2019s higher-order responsiveness to the moral reasons those features constitute.  Moral worth attaches to agential structures that reliably track and are governed by moral reasons; a de dicto motive can supply precisely that structure without incurring the charges of alienation or fetishism.\n\nThe argument proceeds in six steps.  (i)  I sharpen the de dicto / de re distinction and catalogue the main objections.  (ii)  I distinguish two importantly different kinds of de dicto motive, only one of which is vulnerable to the charge of fetishism.  (iii)  I develop a reasons-responsiveness account of moral worth and show that the richer kind of de dicto motive satisfies it.  (iv)  I defend this claim against three prominent critiques: Stocker\u2019s charge of motivational schizophrenia, Railton\u2019s worry about detached moralism, and Wolf\u2019s concern about moral sainthood.  (v)  I show that the proposed view has positive advantages: it fosters impartiality, counters bias under normative uncertainty, and underwrites reflective autonomy.  (vi)  I close by noting limits and clarifying why sentiment and de dicto concern need not be rivals.\n\n2. Clarifying the Target: De Dicto versus De Re Motivation  \nFollowing Gregory Kavka, call a de dicto moral desire one whose content is simply \u201cto do what morality requires\u201d (or \u201cwhat is right\u201d), without encoding any particular moral reason.  A de re moral desire, by contrast, is directed at the concrete right-making consideration itself\u2014e.g., \u201cto relieve Sita\u2019s suffering,\u201d \u201cto keep a promise,\u201d \u201cto respect Ahmed\u2019s autonomy.\u201d  The usual intuition is that genuine virtue engages the world: I rescue a child because she will drown, not because I am chasing the abstraction Rightness.\n\nThis intuition powers three classic objections.  \n(1)  Motivational Schizophrenia (Stocker): an agent who values only doing her duty must, in acting, suppress the very motives\u2014friendship, love, concern\u2014that make the act right; the two stand in tension, producing moral alienation.  \n(2)  Moral Fetishism (Smith, Railton): exclusive focus on rightness treats morality like a shiny object detached from human goods, a fetish rather than an ethical orientation.  \n(3)  Diminished Worth (Arpaly, Wolf): because de dicto motivation is insufficiently responsive to the right-making reasons, such action lacks the quality of attention or care deserved by the beneficiaries; hence it earns less praise.\n\nThese objections proceed on the assumption that de dicto motives are motivationally blind to the values at stake.  The next section complicates that picture.\n\n3. Two Species of De Dicto Motive  \nCall the first, shallow species \u201crule-fetishist desire.\u201d  Here the agent\u2019s aim is to tick the \u201cmorally permissible\u201d box, treating morality as an external badge of honor or purity.  She might know little and care less about why an act is right; avoiding wrongness is a symbolic self-regarding project.  This is what critics rightly disdain.\n\nThe second, richer species I term \u201creflective moral commitment.\u201d  The agent endorses morality not as a fetish but as the authoritative set of reasons she ought, upon reflection, to be guided by.  Her de dicto desire functions as a higher-order disposition: whatever concrete facts ultimately make an act right, she is prepared and motivated to respond to them because they are right-making.  Two features distinguish the reflective commitment:\n\n   A. Reason-Linking: The agent\u2019s disposition is to act for whatever reasons turn out to be decisive; it is a standing policy of normative governance.  \n   B. Cognitive Uptake: In typical cases she does grasp the concrete right-makers and would revise her judgment if new information revealed that the act was not, after all, right.\n\nThus, although the ultimate motive is de dicto, it is not blind; it is mediated by cognition of de re considerations.  It is the difference between \u201cI will do whatever the law of the land says\u201d and \u201cI will comply with the law so far as it is just\u201d; the latter expresses critical uptake of the law\u2019s point.  Only the shallow species invites fetishism.\n\n4. A Reasons-Responsiveness Account of Moral Worth  \nSuppose moral worth (following Kant but also contemporary responsibility theory) attaches to actions produced by an agentive mechanism that is:\n\n   (i)  Sensitive to moral reasons: it would lead the agent to act differently were the relevant moral reasons different.  \n   (ii)  Guided by the agent: the mechanism is integrated into her practical identity.  \n\nOn this view the sentimental texture of motivation\u2014whether sympathetic concern, beneficent joy, or austere duty\u2014is secondary.  What matters is the pattern of counterfactual responsiveness and the internal endorsement of the guiding principle.\n\nA reflective de dicto motive satisfies both conditions.  Because its scope is \u201cwhatever is morally required,\u201d it is maximally sensitive to moral reasons: change the moral landscape, and the agent\u2019s intention, by definition, changes with it.  And because the motive is an expression of her practical self-conception (\u201cbeing moral is who I aspire to be\u201d), it is genuinely hers.  Hence, in normal circumstances, acting from such a motive confers full moral worth.\n\n5. Meeting the Classical Objections  \n\n5.1 Stocker\u2019s Schizophrenia  \nStocker\u2019s hospital visitor, motivated solely by \u201cduty,\u201d cannot muster warm concern and so alienates the patient.  Yet the argument equivocates between motivational exclusivity and motivational sufficiency.  A reflective-duty agent can be solely motivated by duty at the decisive moment while still possessing, cultivating, and even expressing sentiments of concern.  What renders the act worthy is the de dicto motive\u2019s causal efficacy, not its monopoly on the agent\u2019s psychology.  Moreover, situations abound\u2014triage, whistle-blowing, resisting peer pressure\u2014where sentiment misleads and the steady hand of duty is morally preferable.\n\n5.2 Railton\u2019s Fetishism  \nRailton imagines a husband who buys flowers for the abstract reason that \u201cit is morally right to please one\u2019s spouse.\u201d  The act seems affection-less.  But notice: the lack of affection, not the abstractness, does the normative damage.  If the husband\u2019s de dicto motive co-opts affectionate sentiments as part of the right-making reasons (pleasure, intimacy), he acts both from duty and from love.  No fetish appears.  The real target is motivational attenuation, not the formality of the aim.\n\n5.3 Wolf\u2019s Moral Sainthood  \nWolf worries that saints animated solely by morality become dull, lacking non-moral hobbies and attachments.  This is a perfectionist rather than an internal critique: perhaps such saints miss out on the good life, but that is consistent with their actions being morally worthy.  Nothing entails that a reflective-duty orientation must crowd out non-moral pursuits; it merely governs cases where moral reasons are decisive.  Indeed, its abstractness may leave more space for diverse projects than concrete passion does, because it does not tether worth to any particular sentiment.\n\n6. Positive Advantages of the De Dicto Motive  \n\n6.1 Impartiality and Bias-Resistance  \nConcrete sentiments track salient particulars\u2014often the familiar or vividly presented\u2014whereas morality ranges over persons impartially.  A de dicto disposition buffers against partiality by forcing the agent to ask, in each case, \u201cWhat do moral reasons demand?\u201d rather than \u201cHow strongly do I feel?\u201d  Under conditions of scarce attention or empathic fatigue (think online charity choices), this mechanism is more reliable.\n\n6.2 Navigating Normative Uncertainty  \nAgents frequently face disputed moral terrain (climate ethics, data privacy).  A de re sentimental orientation may have no applicable feeling.  But a reflective de dicto motive, combined with epistemic diligence, directs the agent to inquire, deliberate, and act on the best available moral reasons.  The motivational structure is adaptable across contexts precisely because it is content-neutral at the first order.\n\n6.3 Reflective Autonomy  \nKant\u2019s insight: to act from the moral law is to legislate for oneself under the idea of freedom.  The de dicto motive expresses second-order endorsement: \u201cI will be guided by what, upon reflection, I ought to do.\u201d  This stance embodies an ideal of agency that treats the self as accountable to reasons, not merely pushed by subpersonal affects.  Such self-governance is itself worthy of esteem.\n\n7. Illustrative Example  \nConsider Dr. Rao in an overcrowded emergency ward.  Two patients need the last ventilator: her close friend Maya and an unknown janitor, Suraj.  Dr. Rao\u2019s sympathy inclines her toward Maya; her abstract de dicto commitment to do what is right directs her to the hospital\u2019s just triage protocol, which favors Suraj (greater chance of recovery).  Acting from duty she intubates Suraj, then sits with Maya, offering comfort from genuine, albeit frustrated, affection.  Here duty is both sole motivator of the decisive act and manifestly worthy: it overcomes predictable partiality and aligns action with impartial justice.  Far from alienation, Dr. Rao honors both friendship (insofar as permitted) and morality; her de dicto motive integrates, rather than suppresses, other concerns.\n\n8. Distinguishing Form and Object of Motivation  \nA recurring confusion treats the de dicto form (\u201cbecause it is right\u201d) as excluding attention to the right-making object (\u201cbecause she will live\u201d).  The proper conceptual distinction is orthogonal:\n\n   Form: the regulative principle (duty, sympathy, self-interest).  \n   Object: the specific reason recognized (her survival, promised word, etc.).\n\nAn agent can possess a de dicto form while taking in the de re object cognitively and even affectively; what matters for praiseworthiness is that the form guarantees alignment with the object across contexts.  Critics wrongly infer from \u201cduty is the form\u201d to \u201cagent is indifferent to the object.\u201d  Once the axes are disentangled, the alienation worry loses its bite.\n\n9. Limits and Coexistence with Sentiment  \nAcknowledging sufficiency is not denying that sentimental motives often enhance moral worth.  Empathy can deepen appreciation, sustain motivation under stress, and enrich relationships.  The claim is conditional: when sentiments are absent, unavailable, or suspect, the de dicto motive can still underwrite praiseworthy action.  Moreover, real agents are motivationally pluralistic; the healthiest moral psychology may layer de re sentiments atop a de dicto core, yielding both warmth and principled reliability.\n\n10. Conclusion  \nActing \u201cfrom duty alone\u201d need not be bloodless moral fetishism.  Properly understood, a reflective de dicto desire is a higher-order commitment to be governed by moral reasons wherever they lead.  Because such a disposition is maximally reasons-responsive, integrated into the agent\u2019s self-governance, and resilient against bias, actions issuing from it possess full moral worth.  We do\u2014and should\u2014admire the whistle-blower who speaks up because it is right, the judge who sets aside personal sympathy to uphold justice, and the ordinary person who, uncertain yet conscientious, asks \u201cWhat should I do?\u201d and then does it.  Their worth lies precisely in the motive some have disparaged: a principled, reflective devotion to rightness as such.", "output_tokens": 3347, "reasoning_tokens": 768}

Introduction and Thesis  \n\nKant thought that \u201cthe moral worth of an action lies in the maxim,\u201d and many contemporary Kantians maintain that an agent who acts \u201cfrom duty\u201d\u2014because she takes the act to be what morality requires\u2014can earn the highest praise.  But a broad coalition of critics (Stocker, Wolf, Smith, Arpaly) protests that a merely de dicto desire to do what is right is too abstract, too cold, even fetishistic to ground moral worth.  On their view, genuinely admirable agents must be moved by the very considerations that make the act right\u2014other people\u2019s suffering, the beauty of promise-keeping, the importance of gratitude\u2014not by the thin thought that \u201cthis is required by morality.\u201d  Otherwise the agent is alienated from the value she supposedly honors.\n\nI argue that the coalition is partly correct: a merely formal wish to \u201cdo the right thing\u201d is insufficient.  Yet the conclusion many draw\u2014that therefore duty itself cannot suffice for moral worth\u2014doesn\u2019t follow.  The problem is not the de dicto shape of the motive; it is the poverty of a certain content-free version of it.  What is praiseworthy, I claim, is a richer species of de dicto desire\u2014call it a Respectful Reflective Agency commitment (RRA commitment).  Such a commitment is:\n\na. second-order: it is a standing policy to regulate one\u2019s first-order motives by moral reasons;  \nb. value-laden: it is animated by respect for persons as sources of reasons, not by fascination with \u201cMorality-as-such\u201d as a fetish object;  \nc. epistemically loaded: it includes the dispositions required to recognise which concrete considerations count as moral reasons in situ.\n\nAn agent who acts solely from this kind of duty can be fully praiseworthy even when no further first-order concern\u2014friendship, compassion, beneficence\u2014plays a causal role.  The moral worth lies in the successful exercise of the agent\u2019s distinctively rational capacity to govern herself by the moral law conceived as the publicly sharable system of reasons we owe one another.\n\n2. Some Background Distinctions  \n\n2.1 De dicto vs de re motivation.  \nA de re desire to relieve Mei\u2019s suffering has direct reference to Mei; a de dicto desire to \u201cdo the morally required thing\u201d is indexed to a description.  Critics worry that the latter cannot engage with what really matters on the ground.  My defense will show that this worry confuses two very different kinds of de dicto desire.\n\n2.2 Pure-formalist duty vs respect-laden duty.  \nThe fetish charge hits a picture on which \u201cMorality!\u201d is a talisman\u2014an object of fascination detached from persons, reasons, or value.  Kant himself sometimes writes as if this austere attitude suffices, but elsewhere (especially in the Doctrine of Virtue) he insists that the moral law commands us to adopt obligatory ends such as others\u2019 happiness.  I follow the latter strand: a duty-motive worthy of praise already contains implicit concern for concrete reasons.\n\n3. The Standard Case against Duty as Sole Motive  \n\nA brief rehearsal:\n\nStocker\u2019s Hospital Visitor: Friend A visits the hospital because she cares; Friend B visits because \u201cit is my duty.\u201d  Intuitively A is warmer and more admirable.\n\nWolf\u2019s Moral Saint worries: the single-minded dutiful agent crowds out non-moral projects; she ends up, if lovable at all, only by accident.\n\nSmith\u2019s Moral Fetishism: to desire X because it is right is like wanting Y because it is fashionable\u2014an empty, heteronomous dependence on an external label.\n\nArpaly\u2019s Argument from Worth: praise tracks how well the agent responds to the very moral reasons that make the act right.  A pure duty motive, she claims, fails this tracking requirement.\n\nAll four arguments presume that the duty-motive brackets or ignores the concrete values at stake.  If that were the only possible structure for a duty-based motivation, moral worth would indeed require something further.  But there is another structure.\n\n4. The Respectful Reflective Agency (RRA) Account  \n\n4.1 The Core Thought  \nHuman beings are not only passively moved by sympathies; they are also reflective agents capable of recognising, endorsing, and acting from reasons.  A central locus of praise, I suggest, is the competence to represent \u201cwhat morality requires\u201d and to make that representation the immediate ground of decision.  When one succeeds in acting from such a competence, one manifests respect for others as reason-bearing equals.  This manifestation, not the sentiment of compassion itself, is what earns distinctively moral esteem.\n\n4.2 Three Conditions on a Praiseworthy Duty-Motive  \n\nCondition 1 \u2014 Second-order governance.  \nThe agent has adopted a standing policy: \u201cWhen I judge that morality requires \u03c6-ing, I will \u03c6.\u201d  This policy regulates first-order impulses without needing to recruit any independent emotions.\n\nCondition 2 \u2014 Value-laden content.  \nThe policy is sustained by the thought that persons are ends in themselves, that moral reasons are authoritative for creatures like us.  Therefore it is not a fetish with morality\u2019s label; it is a commitment grounded in respect for the bearers of rights and claims.\n\nCondition 3 \u2014 Epistemic competence.  \nThe same standing policy includes dispositions to gather information, to listen, to deliberate honestly.  Without reliable uptake of concrete reasons, the policy would be mere formalism.\n\nWhen these conditions are satisfied, acting \u201csolely from duty\u201d (i.e., no first-order sympathy plays a causally necessary role on that occasion) is nevertheless an exercise of morally admirable agency.\n\n5. Why the RRA Motive Is Sufficient for Moral Worth  \n\nArgument 1: Reliability across contexts.  \nFirst-order sympathies are narrow-band.  Compassion may motivate generous giving to a salient victim yet leave distant beneficiaries ignored.  A de dicto RRA motive, by contrast, is designed to track the whole domain of moral reasons, making the agent reliably responsive even where spontaneous sentiment is silent.  Reliability is a mark of moral worth.\n\nArgument 2: Recognition-respect is a fundamental moral value.  \nDarwall distinguishes \u201cappraisal respect\u201d (esteem) from \u201crecognition respect\u201d (regarding someone\u2019s claims as constraining one\u2019s will).  The RRA motive just is the disposition to accord recognition respect.  To manifest it in action is therefore to honor an essential moral value directly.\n\nArgument 3: Avoiding moral luck in sentiment.  \nWhether I happen to feel compassion for Mei today can be a matter of mood or salience.  Basing worth on such contingencies risks moral luck.  Praiseworthiness rooted in the agent\u2019s standing policy, by contrast, reflects something stably attributable to her character.\n\n6. Answering the Main Objections  \n\nObjection A (Alienation): The dutiful visitor seems cold; the patient feels uncared-for.  \nReply: The patient\u2019s interest in feeling liked is a genuine reason.  A competent RRA agent will register that reason: visiting \u201cbecause it is right\u201d will include visiting in a manner that assuages the patient\u2019s loneliness.  What triggers the visit is duty, but the way the visit is conducted integrates concern for the person.  No alienation arises.\n\nObjection B (Fetishism): Wanting the morally right is like wanting the fashionable\u2014heteronomous.  \nReply: Fashionability is arbitrary; its normative force depends on others\u2019 approval.  Morality\u2019s authority, on the RRA account, derives from the equal status of rational persons.  The agent\u2019s desire is therefore not for a label but for the actuality that justifies the label.  When morality is rightly understood, desiring \u201cwhat is morally required\u201d is desiring to comply with the reasons that every affected person could in principle endorse.\n\nObjection C (Comparative Warmth): Surely a compassionate act is more admirable than a bare duty act.  \nReply: Sometimes yes, because additional virtues add value.  But sufficiency is weaker than optimality.  My claim is not that duty-only acts are maximally praiseworthy, but that they cross the threshold for moral worth.  Extra motives may enhance admiration without rendering the base motive insufficient.\n\nObjection D (Epistemic Failure): Agents who rely on conscience alone may misidentify what morality requires.  \nReply: The third condition (epistemic competence) guards against this.  A misguided crusader who acts on a distorted conscience fails to possess the relevant competence; hence her deed lacks moral worth by my lights, even if it is \u201cfrom duty\u201d in her sense.\n\n7. The Positive Payoff: Two Illustrative Cases  \n\nCase 1: The Exhausted Resident  \nA medical resident finishing a 28-hour shift discovers that the homeless patient in Room 12 has no way to refill his antibiotics prescription.  She is numb, her empathic reserves depleted.  What moves her to pick up the phone, arrange funding, and walk the form across the street is the stark consideration: \u201cI promised to care for my patient, and this is what ethical practice requires.\u201d  No warm feeling animates her.  Still, we praise her precisely for sustaining respect for her patient\u2019s claim despite emotional fatigue.  The RRA account explains this verdict; a sentiment-dependence theory would wrongly withhold praise.\n\nCase 2: The Global Tax Proposal  \nA legislator votes for an unpopular carbon tax.  He tells constituents: \u201cIt is simply the right thing to do; future generations have a claim on us.\u201d  Critics say he fetishizes morality, but imagine that he has studied climate science, listened to coastal communities, and internalised impartiality as a legislative virtue.  His vote is causally grounded in the single abstract thought, yet that thought encodes the concrete reasons.  We can intelligibly admire him\u2014even if he personally dislikes the bill\u2019s immediate consequences for his district\u2014because he governs himself by the reasons that all affected parties share.\n\n8. Comparisons with Alternative Views  \n\n8.1 Sentimentalism.  \nMichael Slote and David Hume locate moral worth in benevolent feelings.  The RRA account allows that sentiments are often laudable but argues they are neither necessary (see Exhausted Resident) nor sufficient (sentimentally loyal mafiosi).  The hallmark of the moral is respect for universalizable reasons, not merely warm affect.\n\n8.2 Arpaly\u2019s \u201cAccidentally Right\u201d Cases.  \nArpaly notes that Huck Finn\u2019s sympathetic concern leads him to help Jim even though he believes it morally wrong.  She concludes motive worth can outrun moral belief.  The RRA account concurs, but explains the phenomenon differently: Huck\u2019s act has worth because his de re concern for Jim manifests recognition respect at the concrete level, partly compensating for his faulty de dicto belief.  The case shows de re motives can suffice when de dicto fails; it does not show de dicto can never suffice.\n\n8.3 Wolf\u2019s Reasonableness Condition.  \nWolf says praiseworthy agents must be both moral and sane, capable of engaging with non-moral values.  The RRA motive does not crowd out the aesthetic, the comic, or the personal; it merely governs them when they conflict with persons\u2019 claims.  One can cheer at a baseball game, write avant-garde music, and still reserve decision priority for moral reasons.  So RRA survives the Moral Saint worry.\n\n9. Substantive Implications  \n\nImplication 1: Education.  \nMoral education should inculcate the standing policy, not merely sentiments.  Programs that combine perspective-taking with principled deliberation better approximate RRA than empathy-only curricula.\n\nImplication 2: Institutional Design.  \nWe should design professional codes (medicine, law, engineering) that scaffold second-order duty commitments\u2014checklists, audits, peer review\u2014because such structures enable agents to act from duty even under affective fatigue.\n\nImplication 3: Praise and Blame Practices.  \nPublic praise should highlight the agent\u2019s respect-manifesting stance: \u201cDr. Lee went above and beyond because she recognised her obligation to her patient,\u201d thereby reinforcing the norm of RRA rather than celebrating idiosyncratic compassion alone.\n\n10. Possible Extensions and Research Questions  \n\na. Can artificial agents possess an RRA-type motive?  The account suggests a route: endow them with rule-following architectures that approximate recognition respect.  \nb. Does RRA explain supererogation?  Perhaps supererogatory acts are those the basic duty policy does not require, thus adding a layer of excellence beyond sufficiency.  \nc. How does RRA intersect with virtues like courage or wisdom?  These may be enabling traits that secure the epistemic and executive prerequisites of the duty policy.\n\n11. Conclusion  \n\nActing from duty can indeed suffice for moral worth, but only when \u201cduty\u201d is understood as a Respectful Reflective Agency commitment: a second-order, value-laden, epistemically competent policy to govern oneself by the reasons one owes to others as equals.  Such a motive is not a fetishistic attachment to an empty label; it is the practical expression of recognition respect.  It earns praise because it manifests the agent\u2019s distinctive rational power to treat persons, including herself, as bearers of claims that override contingent impulses.  Sentimental motives, when present, may add warmth and flourish, yet the cool clarity of duty\u2014properly conceived\u2014is neither cold nor empty.  It is the heat of reason, and when it alone moves an agent to right action, the act is fully worthy of moral esteem.", "output_tokens": 3452, "reasoning_tokens": 576}

Introduction and Thesis  \n\nIs an agent who acts \u201csolely from the motive of duty\u201d\u2014understood as a de dicto desire to do whatever is morally right\u2014necessarily deficient in moral worth? I shall argue that the standard charge of \u201cmoral fetishism\u201d is overstated. A purely dutiful motive can, under certain conditions, suffice for praiseworthy action. The key is to see duty not as an arid fixation on an abstract property, but as a higher-order practical commitment that orchestrates the agent\u2019s first-order motivational economy. When duty functions in this role, (i) it expresses a form of autonomous self-governance, (ii) it manifests epistemic humility in the face of normative complexity, and (iii) it offers others a distinctive kind of assurance. These three features together ground the moral worth of dutiful action\u2014without denying the independent value of richer first-order concerns such as sympathy or friendship.  \n\nI proceed in five steps. Section 2 clarifies the de dicto / de re distinction and diagnoses why fetishism worries arise. Section 3 introduces a novel distinction between opaque and transparent de dicto motivation; only the former is suspect. Section 4 develops a positive account of duty as a higher-order, second-personal commitment that can itself confer moral worth. Section 5 rebuts four leading objections. Section 6 concludes with two upshots for contemporary moral psychology.\n\n2. Why Duty Looks Fetishistic  \n\n2.1 De dicto and de re moral motivation  \nA de re motive picks out a concrete right-making consideration (say, the child\u2019s welfare) and moves the agent via that very feature. A de dicto motive, by contrast, is content-neutral: \u201cI want, whatever it is, to do the morally right thing here.\u201d Kant\u2019s famous shopkeeper, who charges a fair price because \u201cit is his duty,\u201d is the paradigm.  \n\n2.2 The fetishism charge  \nMichael Smith and others claim that a de dicto motive \u201cfetishises\u201d the property of rightness: the agent seems fascinated by an abstract label rather than by people, needs, or suffering. The apparent pathology has two parts. First, it seems motivationally thin\u2014what, exactly, pushes the agent if not concrete concern? Second, it threatens alienation: the beneficiary suspects that the agent is not moved by her plight but only by some cold ideal.  \n\n2.3 Hidden assumptions  \nThe fetishism worry presupposes that: (a) concrete reasons are always psychologically available, and (b) responding to them is always superior. Both assumptions are doubtful. Morally salient features can be opaque or contested in real time (consider climate policy), and agents often confront normative uncertainty. In such contexts, a higher-order desire \u201cto do whatever is right\u201d may be the most reliable tether to morality available.\n\n3. Opaque versus Transparent De dicto Motivations  \n\nWe need a sharper lens. Merely marking an agent \u201cde dicto motivated\u201d collapses two importantly different psychologies.\n\n\u2022 Opaque duty: The agent is insensitive to what makes an act right. She prizes the property of \u201crightness\u201d as a fetish object; if told tomorrow that morality required cruelty, she would comply. Such an agent is alienated indeed.\n\n\u2022 Transparent duty: The agent\u2019s first project is to track whatever the right-making reasons turn out to be. She says, \u201cI shall do what morality requires,\u201d where this very stance includes openness to (and if time allows, active search for) the considerations that render the act right. If confronted with new evidence about others\u2019 welfare, she revises her plan.  \n\nOnly opaque duty deserves the pejorative label; transparent duty does not. The fetishism literature rarely distinguishes the two, thereby indicting duty in toto for sins of a subset.\n\n4. The Moral Worth of Transparent Duty  \n\n4.1 Autonomous self-governance  \nActing from duty transparently understood is an exercise of autonomy in the Kantian (but not exclusively Kantian) sense: the agent authors her will under the idea of a law she gives herself. The moral law\u2019s content is admittedly external to her immediate desires, yet by treating it as authoritative she governs her motivational set rather than being governed by it. Insofar as morality commands respect, such self-rule is intrinsically worthy.\n\n4.2 Epistemic humility  \nReal agents face moral disagreement, cognitive bias, and limited information. A de dicto orientation functions like a compass: \u201cWhatever the terrain, point me toward moral north.\u201d On this view duty is a regulative placeholder for the right-making reasons the agent cannot yet fully grasp. This stance is ethically valuable because it acknowledges, rather than suppresses, one\u2019s epistemic limits. Praiseworthiness accrues to someone who structures her agency so that, when ignorance lifts, action will still converge on what is required.\n\n4.3 Social assurance  \nFrom the perspective of others, a transparently dutiful agent is reliable in a distinctive way. Someone motivated by fluctuating sympathy might falter if her sentiments cool; someone moved by self-interest will help only when incentives align. The dutiful agent signals: \u201cIrrespective of how I feel about you, I will do right by you.\u201d Especially in asymmetric power relations (doctors, judges, employers), such assurance is not cold but comforting. The patient can trust that care will be delivered even if she is annoying or ungrateful.\n\n5. Four Objections Reconsidered  \n\nObjection 1: Alienation is inevitable because the agent is not moved by the victim\u2019s welfare.  \nReply: Alienation is a relational notion. What repels the beneficiary is disregard for her status, not disregard for a particular feeling of sympathy. A transparently dutiful agent\u2019s stance\u2014respecting the other precisely as a bearer of moral claims\u2014treats her as a moral equal. Respect can be as intimacy-affirming as empathy; sometimes more so. The alienation worry conflates absence of a specific sentiment with absence of regard.\n\nObjection 2: De dicto motivation is motivationally inert; \u201crightness\u201d has no causal oomph without some de re substrate.  \nReply: Psychologically, higher-order desires routinely energise action (think of dieters whose only occurrent motive is \u201cstick to the diet plan,\u201d not any love of kale). Neuro-cognitive studies show that abstract rule adherence activates prefrontal circuitry linked to goal maintenance. Moreover, transparent duty typically recruits auxiliary motives\u2014curiosity, planning, aversion to wrongdoing\u2014that the agent endorses. The causal chain is as robust as any ordinary desire-based explanation.\n\nObjection 3: Moral worth demands sensitivity to the *right* reason; a de dicto agent is only accidentally right if her moral beliefs are mistaken.  \nReply: Moral worth is compatible with unavoidable error so long as the agent\u2019s reasoning is *competent*. The epistemic standards we apply to engineers or physicians (reasonable, evidence-responsive care) apply here. If she marshals the best evidence, consults peers, and deliberates sincerely, her action displays virtue even if\u2014ex hypothesi\u2014her community\u2019s moral code is later overturned. Blame rests with collective ignorance, not with her dutiful orientation.\n\nObjection 4: The story works only if duty is supplemented by first-order concern. But the question stipulates \u201csolely from duty.\u201d  \nReply: \u201cSolely\u201d can mean two things: (a) no other motive is present at all, or (b) other motives are present but they are normatively inert. Critics take (a), I grant only (b). Even on (b) the case is interesting: the agent\u2019s *decisive* motive is duty; sympathy might float around but does no causal work. Kant\u2019s \u201ccold philanthropist\u201d saved out of respect alone exemplifies (b). Such action is still praiseworthy *because* what clinches the decision is the self-conscious commitment to rightness. If literal motivational monism (a) ever occurs in human psychology, my account predicts its moral worth would depend on the same structural features\u2014as long as autonomy, humility, and assurance are maintained.\n\n6. Illustrative Cases  \n\nCase A: The Lifeguard under Uncertainty  \nA beach lifeguard notices two swimmers flailing. He cannot tell which one is closer to drowning, and time is short. Remembering the rescue-protocol manual, he chooses the child, explicitly \u201cbecause that is the right thing to do.\u201d His motive is de dicto: he cares mainly about conforming to the rescue duty. The decision exemplifies epistemic humility (he follows a rule precisely because he lacks concrete knowledge) and social assurance (any swimmer can expect fair treatment). Far from fetishistic, the motive channels his professional role into reliable action.\n\nCase B: The Impartial Judge  \nA judge presides over a case involving a former friend. She consciously brackets her affections, reminding herself, \u201cMy duty is to apply the law impartially.\u201d She feels no personal warmth toward the litigant she ultimately favours. The de dicto motive secures justice precisely by disabling parochial sympathy. Observers praise her integrity, not her affect. The case shows how duty can outperform first-order concern when partiality is a risk.\n\n7. Implications for Moral Psychology and Ethical Theory  \n\nFirst, the debate over duty\u2019s sufficiency has suffered from an overly coarse taxonomy of motives. Introducing the opaque/transparent distinction helps reconcile apparently conflicting data: some dutiful agents repel, others inspire. Researchers in empirical moral psychology can operationalise transparency (e.g., sensitivity to new moral evidence) to predict when de dicto motivation correlates with pro-social behaviour.  \n\nSecond, the analysis illuminates a neglected pathway to moral development. Moral education often tries to cultivate empathy or particular virtues. But cultivating *transparent* dutifulness\u2014training agents to seek, track, and integrate right-making reasons\u2014might be a sturdier strategy in pluralistic societies where we cannot assume shared sentiments.  \n\n8. Conclusion  \n\nActing \u201csolely from duty\u201d need not be morally anaemic. When the higher-order desire to do what is right is transparent\u2014open to the considerations that make acts right\u2014it embodies autonomy, epistemic responsibility, and a publicly reassuring commitment to justice. These features jointly ground moral worth. Fetishism arises only where duty becomes opaque, cut off from the reasons it is meant to honor. Moral philosophy should therefore shift focus: the real task is not to replace de dicto motives with de re ones, but to cultivate transparent duty that integrates, rather than eclipses, the world\u2019s concrete moral textures.", "output_tokens": 2789, "reasoning_tokens": 512}

Introduction and Thesis\n\nIs an abstract desire to \u201cdo the morally right thing\u201d\u2014call this a de dicto moral desire\u2014good enough to confer moral worth on an action? An influential line of thought says \u201cno.\u201d It insists that genuine praiseworthiness requires being moved by the concrete right-making considerations themselves: the stranger\u2019s suffering, the partner\u2019s need for honesty, the refugee\u2019s vulnerability, and so on. Someone who acts from a purely de dicto motive, critics urge, displays a kind of moral fetishism and is alienated from what morality is really about. \n\nI argue that this widespread skepticism is overstated. A de dicto desire to do what is morally right can, by itself, suffice for moral worth, provided that it satisfies two further conditions:\n\n(1) Tracking Condition: The de dicto desire must be reliably sensitive to the right-making reasons\u2014it must dispose the agent to act as those reasons require across relevantly nearby situations.\n\n(2) Ownership Condition: The de dicto desire must issue from the agent\u2019s own critical practical agency rather than from blind deference (e.g., servile conformity or mere obedience).\n\nWhen these conditions are met, acting from a purely de dicto motive manifests the very capacities that make agents deserving of moral praise: practical rationality oriented toward the moral domain and self-governance that takes morality as authoritative. Far from being a fetish, such motivation expresses a structurally higher-order concern: \u201cWhatever the moral reasons are, I shall treat them as decisive.\u201d That stance is admirable even when the agent is not also moved by the first-order considerations that happen to make the act right. \n\nThe argument proceeds in five steps. Sections 2 and 3 clarify the concept of a de dicto moral desire and the charge of fetishism. Section 4 develops the positive account of how the Tracking and Ownership conditions convert bare de dicto motivation into praiseworthy action. Section 5 engages leading objections\u2014alienation, emotional deficit, and motivational fragility. Section 6 draws larger implications.\n\n2. Two Kinds of Moral Desire\n\nWe need a precise map of the territory. Following Markovits and Arpaly, distinguish:\n\nDe dicto moral desire: a higher-order aim describable only as \u201cto do what is morally right (whatever that is).\u201d It is formally contentful but materially unspecific.\n\nDe re moral desire: a first-order aim for the very properties that render the act right (to relieve suffering, to keep a promise, to respect autonomy, etc.).\n\nCritics worry about cases where the de dicto desire appears motivationally isolated from any de re concern. For instance, \u201cPrinciple Pete\u201d donates 10% of his income because \u201cthat\u2019s what duty requires,\u201d but he reports no fellow-feeling for the beneficiaries. His affect seems cold; his gaze is fixed on the moral law in abstraction. Is Pete worthy of praise?\n\n3. The Fetishism and Alienation Charges\n\nTwo families of arguments target the sufficiency of de dicto desire.\n\n3.1 Moral Fetishism (Smith 1994). The fetish charge says that the de dicto agent treats morality itself as a mere object of desire\u2014like collecting stamps\u2014not as what confers normative authority. This looks perverse: morality should guide action because it is good for people, or respects autonomy, not because \u201cmorality\u201d as such attracts me.\n\n3.2 Moral Alienation (Stocker 1976; Wolf 1982). The alienation complaint points to an experiential deficit. A lovable person helps a friend out of concern for the friend, not out of \u201cduty.\u201d Sole de dicto motivation signals a gustatory distance from the human point of morality.\n\nBoth critiques assume that de dicto motivation crowds out or replaces the first-order motives that ground right-making features. I contend that this assumption is false. A de dicto desire can be functionally integrated with sensitivity to first-order reasons without being identical to them.\n\n4. A Functionalist Defense of De Dicto Motivation\n\n4.1 Tracking Condition\n\nThink of a de dicto moral desire as a policy: \u201cAct as morality requires.\u201d Whether that policy produces morally correct behavior depends on a guidance system that tracks moral reasons across varying contexts. Praiseworthiness, I submit, attaches not to the internal phenomenology of warm concern but to the agent\u2019s competence at following the moral truth. \n\nCompare: A mathematician who yearns \u201cto believe what is mathematically true\u201d (a de dicto aim) is intellectually virtuous if she reliably deduces truths, revises errors, and follows proof wherever it leads. The virtue lies in truth-tracking competence, not in loving prime numbers for their own sake. Likewise, a de dicto moral agent is praiseworthy when her abstract allegiance issues in action that registers and responds correctly to the relevant concrete reasons.\n\n4.2 Ownership Condition\n\nMere conformity to duty under threat or mindless deference is not yet praiseworthy. What we admire is self-governing commitment: the agent endorses morality\u2019s authority on reflective grounds and thereby adopts the de dicto motive as hers. That ownership secures the agent\u2019s freedom and explains why her success counts as an achievement rather than a happy coincidence or coercion.\n\n4.3 Putting the Conditions Together\n\nWhere both conditions hold, the de dicto motive functions as a higher-order regulator, analogous to a thermostat. It does not encode each right-making property but is calibrated to keep behavior within the morally acceptable range. Because it operates reliably (Tracking) and from self-authorization (Ownership), its operation expresses precisely the capacities\u2014responsiveness to reason and autonomous commitment\u2014that underwrite moral praise. \n\nOne may worry that this treats concrete empathy as optional. I deny that. The Tracking condition often requires cultivating emotional sensitivity; compassion and empathy are excellent epistemic detectors of others\u2019 welfare. What matters is that these sensitivities are recruited instrumentally by the higher-order de dicto policy, even if they are not always occurrently motivating.\n\n5. Responding to Objections\n\n5.1 The Emotional Deficit Objection\n\n\u201cBut Pete lacks the warm concern we find admirable.\u201d Two replies. First, praiseworthiness in the moral sphere is not identical to lovability. We can separate the virtue of benevolence from the virtue of principled justice. Second, nothing in the de dicto model forbids emotional engagement; it only declines to make such engagement criterial for moral worth. If Pete\u2019s abstract commitment reliably produces benevolent behavior, his emotional style may be less endearing but still morally admirable.\n\n5.2 The Wrong Reasons Objection\n\nSuppose Pete gives because he craves moral approval or heavenly reward. Such external incentives fail the Ownership test; they are not the agent\u2019s recognition of morality\u2019s authority but rather self-interested derivatives. My view predicts that such cases lack moral worth, thereby accommodating intuitive verdicts.\n\n5.3 The Motivational Fragility Objection\n\nCritics note that a de dicto desire seems informationally impoverished: \u201cDo the right thing\u201d specifies no actionable plan. Won\u2019t it collapse when the agent is uncertain what morality requires? This is where the Tracking condition is essential. A praiseworthy de dicto agent possesses the capacities\u2014deliberative, affective, imaginative\u2014to discover what duty demands and to revise her judgment under new evidence. She is resilient, not fragile, in the face of moral uncertainty.\n\n5.4 The Supererogation Worry\n\nCan a purely de dicto motive explain supererogatory sacrifice? Yes. Agents may accept an overriding de dicto norm like \u201cpromote the greatest moral good, even beyond strict duty.\u201d If they own that norm and reliably track the relevant reasons, their morally extraordinary acts flow from their de dicto stance.\n\n6. Examples That Do Real Work\n\nExample 1: The Lab Technician\n\nAda is a laboratory technician overseeing an experiment that releases mild irritants if safety protocols fail. She notices a parameter out of range. She is unmoved by the imagined discomfort of distant subjects (she finds such mental imagery hard to conjure) but acts instantly because \u201cthe moral thing is to shut the trial down.\u201d Her reliable practice emerged from years of training herself to treat moral requirements as decisive. Ada\u2019s intervention prevents harm. Despite lacking empathic resonance, her action is praiseworthy: she acted competently, tracked the harm-related reasons, and owned her policy.\n\nExample 2: The Conscientious Juror\n\nBrianna serves on a jury in a politically charged case. She wants above all \u201cto reach the morally right verdict.\u201d Her personal sympathies lie with the defendant, but the evidence convinces her of guilt. Over three days she reviews testimonies, studies jury instructions, and consults her sense of justice. She votes to convict, tears in her eyes. Her de dicto desire did not anesthetize empathy; it disciplined it. The moral worth of her vote flows precisely from her readiness to bracket first-order feelings when they conflict with what the best reasons require.\n\nThese cases show that the de dicto motive, properly functioning, secures moral reliability and expressive autonomy\u2014core bases of praise.\n\n7. Comparative Evaluation with De Re Motivation\n\nDoes my view discard the value of de re motives? Not at all. Often, being motivated by the right-making features is an excellent way to satisfy the Tracking condition, because concrete concern facilitates accurate perception of moral reasons. What I deny is necessity. The structure of moral worth is multiple-realizable: diverse motivational profiles can manifest the same competent responsiveness to moral reasons. Insisting on de re motives risks moral parochialism, for it privileges emotional temperaments over principled commitment and could rate a warm but erratic benefactor above a principled but affectively muted agent\u2014contrary to many judgments about reliability and responsibility.\n\n8. Distinguishing Two Kinds of Praise\n\nWe should also separate evaluative layers:\n\nAgent-neutral value: The goodness of the outcome.\n\nAgentive moral worth: The praiseworthiness of the agent\u2019s contribution.\n\nSomething similar occurs in aesthetics. One may admire a minimalist architect not for sensuous warmth but for disciplined elegance. Likewise, moral praise can attach to disciplined structure of will.\n\n9. Broader Implications\n\n9.1 Moral Education\n\nMoral pedagogy that inculcates a higher-order respect for moral reasons may better accommodate pluralistic societies. Children taught to ask \u201cWhat is the right thing?\u201d learn a portable deliberative skillset. Later they can fill in substance\u2014welfare, fairness, rights\u2014without having each possible right-making feature already emotionally loaded.\n\n9.2 Artificial Agents\n\nDebates about moral A.I. often assume that genuine moral worth is impossible without empathetic feelings. My account suggests a path: If an artificial system could own a de dicto norm under functional analogues of Tracking and Ownership, its actions would at least bear the structural marks of moral worth, whatever further metaphysical worries remain.\n\n10. Conclusion\n\nThe motive of duty, construed de dicto, need not be a cold fetish. When integrated into a reliable, self-endorsed guidance structure, it can underwrite actions that manifest the core virtues morality demands: sensitivity to reason and autonomous commitment. Therefore, acting solely from a desire to do what is morally right can indeed suffice for morally worthy conduct. Its praiseworthiness derives not from sentimental warmth but from reason\u2019s capacity to guide itself by moral norms\u2014a capacity as worthy of admiration as any tender feeling.", "output_tokens": 2676, "reasoning_tokens": 256}

Framing the Question  \n\nImagine two physicians rushing to treat a stranger who has collapsed on the pavement.  Dr. Grace is moved by vivid empathy: she can almost feel the victim\u2019s pain and is propelled by concern for his welfare.  Dr. Hale is moved instead by a single all\u2010purpose resolution: \u201cIt is morally right to help, and that is decisive.\u201d  She finds the patient\u2019s specific plight motivationally inert except as evidence that helping is required.  Is Hale\u2019s conduct\u2014motivated solely by a de dicto desire to do the morally right thing\u2014less worthy of praise than Grace\u2019s?  Many philosophers think so.  They accuse Hale of \u201cmoral fetishism\u201d (Stocker), \u201calienation\u201d (Williams), or an impoverished moral psychology (Wolf, Hursthouse).  According to this critique, praiseworthy agents must be fired by the very considerations that make the act right\u2014welfare, justice, promise\u2010keeping\u2014and not merely by an abstract wish to be morally up\u2010to\u2010date.\n\nI will argue that the critics have aimed at the wrong target.  A purely de dicto desire to do what is right can, under certain conditions, suffice for moral worth, and sometimes it is the best motive an agent could have.  What makes such action praiseworthy is not warm emotional resonance with the right\u2010making features, but the manifestation of two higher\u2010order capacities that are themselves morally valuable:  \n\nA. Rational responsiveness: the agent\u2019s de dicto desire is reliably regulated by her best judgment about which concrete reasons obtain.  \n\nB. Diachronic coordination: the desire furnishes an executive framework that integrates the agent\u2019s conduct across heterogeneous contexts, thereby expressing a stable commitment to treat persons according to the demands of morality, whatever they turn out to be.  \n\nWhen these conditions are met, the \u201cduty motive\u201d does not alienate the agent from morality\u2019s substantive point; rather, it efficiently channels her agency toward it.  The allegedly fetishistic appearance arises only in defective variants\u2014where the de dicto desire is insulated from reason or functions as a self\u2010regarding badge of moral status.  \n\nThe argument proceeds in four stages.  (\u00a72) I clarify what a de dicto moral desire is and distinguish two functional roles it can play.  (\u00a73) I diagnose the standard fetishism objection.  (\u00a74) I defend the positive proposal, supplying examples and replying to three leading counterarguments.  (\u00a75) I draw two upshots for debates about moral worth and moral psychology.\n\n2. What Is a De Dicto Moral Desire?  \n\nTo want, de dicto, \u201cto do what is morally right\u201d is to have a standing higher\u2010order disposition: whenever one believes that some act \u03c6 is morally required, that belief by itself motivates one to \u03c6.  The desire is content\u2010general; it points, not to any particular value (welfare, fairness, autonomy), but to whatever features make actions right, whatever they might be.  Still, the motive can function in two very different ways.\n\n2.1 The Regulative Role.  Here the desire operates as an executive summary of first\u2010order reasons.  The agent forms the belief that \u03c6 is morally required because \u03c6 will relieve suffering or honor a promise.  The de dicto desire gets her out of the chair; the concrete reasons selected the target.  Call this the transparent duty motive.\n\n2.2 The Insulated Role.  Alternatively, an agent may cherish an identity as \u201csomeone who always does the right thing\u201d while remaining motivationally indifferent to the right\u2010making facts.  She cares that \u03c6 is morally required, but not why.  Call this the opaque duty motive.\n\nThe critics\u2019 cases typically focus on opaque versions.  But nothing in the idea of a de dicto desire entails opacity; indeed Kant\u2019s own description of acting \u201cfrom duty\u201d presupposes transparency, since the good will must act \u201cfor the sake of the law\u201d as it applies to the particulars.  The question, then, is whether transparent duty can itself ground moral worth.\n\n3. Diagnosing the Fetishism Charge  \n\nThe charge has two strands.\n\nAlienation.  Acting from abstract duty allegedly fails to engage appropriately with the people or goods at stake.  This is thought to cheapen the moral value of the act, just as giving a gift solely to satisfy social convention seems less generous than giving out of friendship.\n\nPerverse Valuing.  A de dicto desire seems to prize moral rightness as an object, turning morality into a collectible rather than a relation to persons.  That, says the critic, is morally perverse.\n\nBoth worries trade on the same assumption: to *appreciate* a moral reason just is to be *motivated by* that very reason.  If the motive\u2019s content differs, appreciation is missing.  I reject that assumption.  Appreciative understanding can be registered in judgment, while motivation is supplied by a higher\u2010order desire to act as judged.  Plato\u2019s \u201cspirit,\u201d to use an older model, need not mirror the \u201creason\u201d that commands it; what matters is that spirit listens to reason faithfully.\n\n4. A Positive Case for Dutiful Motivation  \n\n4.1 The Coordination Argument  \n\nMorality\u2019s demands are numerous, heterogeneous, and occasionally in tension.  Agents need a unifying executive policy for how to respond to whatever conglomerate of grounds\u2014welfare here, fidelity there, fairness elsewhere\u2014turn out to be decisive in a given case.  A content\u2010general desire \u201cto do what is morally right\u201d performs that coordinating task elegantly.  It functions like a legal principle instructing courts to apply \u201cthe law\u201d\u2014without specifying in advance which statutes and precedents will matter in each suit.  By contrast, a portfolio of discrete benevolent sentiments, each keyed to a particular value, leaves motivational gaps where unfamiliar or conflicting values arise.  (History is replete with kind masters who nonetheless perpetuated injustice because their humane sympathy failed to register to their slaves\u2019 equal moral status.)  A duty motive that tracks our best moral judgment is more reliable across changing circumstances and hence a locus of praiseworthiness.\n\n4.2 The Respect Argument  \n\nSecond, to value rightness as such is to value persons *as* moral equals.  The content of moral rightness\u2014whatever ethical theory ultimately decides\u2014centrally concerns how we must treat others if we are to respect them.  A general commitment to rightness therefore embodies respect in a deep form: it is an acknowledgment that others\u2019 claims exert authority over one\u2019s will.  That relational stance can be present even when the agent is not moved by tender concern or sympathetic resonance.  Indeed, a judge who sentences a relative out of duty, suppressing partial affection, displays respect for the citizenry\u2019s equal status precisely through a de dicto moral motive.\n\n4.3 The Reliability Argument  \n\nPraiseworthiness is partly a matter of credit.  We praise agents, not for lucky conformity to morality, but for manifesting stable dispositions that *would* lead them to act rightly under a variety of counterfactual conditions.  A transparent de dicto desire that is sensitive to deliberative updates passes this modal test.  Empathic concern, by contrast, is notoriously context\u2010sensitive and subject to bias (Small, Loewenstein & Slovic 2007).  If Hale\u2019s general duty reliably counteracts her implicit partialities, she is more creditworthy than Grace, even if Grace happens on this occasion to act equally well.\n\n4.4 Objection 1: Emotional Impoverishment  \n\n\u201cBut,\u201d the critic replies, \u201cisn\u2019t something missing if the agent feels no compassion?\u201d  Two answers.  (i) Compassion may indeed enhance moral worth, but sufficiency is a weaker claim: Hale\u2019s act is *enough* for praise even if it is not maximally admirable.  (ii) In many cases emotional neutrality is positively appropriate: surgeons suppress empathy to avoid trembling hands; auditors avoid friendship to maintain impartiality.  What matters is fitness to role.\n\n4.5 Objection 2: Wrong Kind of Reason  \n\nSome maintain that appealing to moral rightness is the \u201cwrong kind of reason\u201d for action, akin to playing chess because the rules say so rather than to checkmate.  Yet in morality, the rules are not arbitrary constraints; they *express* the point\u2014respect for persons.  The chess analogy therefore misfires.  A better comparison is scientific inquiry: one may investigate a phenomenon simply because one wants the truth.  No scientist is accused of \u201ctruth fetishism.\u201d\n\n4.6 Objection 3: Empty Formalism  \n\nFinally, consider the worry that a de dicto desire is vacuous because *anything* could count as right if the agent\u2019s ethical beliefs are misguided.  Transparency again matters.  The desire must be *responsive to reasons*: the agent is disposed to revise her view when confronted with evidence, argument, or lived experience.  A racist who clings to bigotry \u201cout of duty\u201d lacks such responsiveness; hence her motive is not praiseworthy.  The sufficiency claim is conditional on the duty motive being properly connected to the normatively relevant facts.\n\n4.7 Illustrative Case: The Anonymous Donor  \n\nSuppose an epidemiologist donates 30% of her salary to effective global\u2010health charities.  She feels little emotive pull toward distant beneficiaries; instead, she adheres to a policy: \u201cWhenver a donation would do more good than any competing use of my resources, morality requires me to donate, and I therefore shall.\u201d  Critics might deem her cold.  Yet her policy channels resources to those in need more reliably, and with less bias, than the intermittent sympathy of most donors.  Her action structure demonstrates respect for the lives at stake; it displays rational responsiveness to evidence about cost\u2010effectiveness; and it bears diachronic stability.  That seems fully praiseworthy.\n\n5. Broader Implications  \n\nFirst, the analysis nuances Kantian moral worth.  The venerable slogan \u201conly actions done from duty have moral worth\u201d often strikes modern ears as implausibly austere.  Read through the lens of the transparent duty motive, Kant\u2019s claim is more plausible: he was emphasizing that what merits special esteem is an act that issues from the agent\u2019s commitment to *act on reasons as such*\u2014a commitment which, in a finite rational being, remains necessary even when sympathetic drives concur.\n\nSecond, the account illuminates moral education.  Early moral development cannot feasibly install a distinct sentiment for each value.  What teachers cultivate, at least initially, is a general resolution: \u201cDo what is right and take trouble to find out what that is.\u201d  Later, richer value\u2010specific emotions may blossom, but they are not indispensable to worth.\n\n6. Conclusion  \n\nActing from the motive of duty need not be a form of moral fetishism.  When the de dicto desire (i) tracks an agent\u2019s best, constantly revisable judgment about concrete moral reasons and (ii) coordinates her agency across contexts, it embodies precisely the capacities\u2014respect, rational governance, reliability\u2014that make moral conduct praiseworthy.  Warm feelings and direct concern for welfare are welcome supplements, often deepening the beauty of moral life, but they are not the essence of moral worth.  In many real\u2010world situations\u2014where partial sympathies, fatigue, or fear threaten to sway us\u2014a principled higher\u2010order commitment to \u201cdo what is right, whatever that turns out to be\u201d is not merely adequate; it is the most admirable motive we can have.", "output_tokens": 3158, "reasoning_tokens": 704}

A de dicto desire to \u201cdo what is morally right\u201d can on its own ground an action\u2019s moral worth, provided that (i) the desire is reason-responsive in the right way and (ii) its operation manifests the agent\u2019s distinctive form of regard for others that Kant called respect. Where those two conditions are met, acting solely \u201cfrom duty\u201d is neither fetishistic nor alienated; it is an elegant higher-order strategy for reliably tracking the very first-order considerations critics think it neglects.  \n\nI. Mapping the Terrain  \nContemporary critics\u2014A. Arpaly, S. Wolf, P. Railton, among others\u2014accept the following syllogism:  \n1. To have moral worth, an action must be motivated by the right-making considerations.  \n2. A purely de dicto wish \u201cto do the morally right thing\u201d is motivationally blind to those considerations.  \n\u2234 Therefore a purely de dicto wish cannot confer moral worth.  \n\nThe argument looks powerful because (1) enjoys wide support: what we praise is not bare conformity with duty but a quality of will that takes the relevant reasons to heart. The real work therefore occurs in premise (2). I shall argue that (2) equivocates between two very different kinds of de dicto orientation. \u201cMoral fetishism\u201d is a problem only for one of them.  \n\nII. Two De Dicto Desires: Deferential vs. Deliberative  \nCall a desire \u201cdeferentially de dicto\u201d when its content is simply \u201cDo whatever the moral law says,\u201d where that law is treated as an external oracle. Agents of this type outsource moral cognition; their pattern is: (i) find out moral verdict, (ii) obey. They would, as critics point out, obey the oracle even if the right-making features inexplicably changed. Such motivation is indeed disturbingly fetishistic: the oracle, not the underlying value, is doing the guiding.  \n\nContrast a \u201cdeliberatively de dicto\u201d desire: \u201cDo what is morally right, where \u2018morally right\u2019 is whatever is supported by the weightiest impartial reasons.\u201d The crucial difference is that the second desire incorporates a deliberative role for first-order considerations. It directs the agent to seek out, weigh, and respond to the very considerations that constitute rightness. The de dicto form functions like a higher-order filter that says: \u201cTrack whatever considerations turn out to matter.\u201d  \n\nOnce this distinction is in place, premise (2) loses its grip. Only deferential de dicto desire is motivation-blind. Deliberative de dicto desire is better understood as an *architecture* for being guided by the substance.  \n\nIII. A Working Example  \nSuppose Mira is hurrying to catch a train when she sees a stranger collapse. Two motivations stir: (a) empathic concern\u2014\u201cThat person must be terrified and in pain\u201d; (b) a deliberative de dicto concern\u2014\u201cIt would be wrong to leave her unaided.\u201d Critics say only (a) can ground moral worth. But imagine an alternate case: Mira\u2019s empathic capacities are temporarily numbed by shock. All she can register is that someone is in medical peril, a fact she recognizes as morally weighty though she feels no sympathy. Her de dicto desire to do what morality requires kicks in, producing swift, competent aid. Does she act with moral worth? Intuitions diverge less sharply than the literature suggests: we still want to praise her. What does the praising track? Not warm feelings, but a steadfast commitment to respond to objective need\u2014manifested here via the deliberative de dicto route.  \n\nIV. Respect as the Underlying Valuable Attitude  \nWhy does the deliberative de dicto motive deserve praise? Because it manifests *respect*. Kantian respect is neither emotion nor empathy but a recognition of persons (or sentient beings) as loci of value whose claims make legitimate demands on one\u2019s will. Respect is naturally expressed in a higher-order form: \u201cI shall do what these beings rightly require of me,\u201d even if I currently lack the sentimental dispositions that would make those requirements motivationally vivid. De dicto desire is precisely that form of respect, made operational.  \n\nV. The Quality-of-Will Criterion Revisited  \nMost contemporary theories of moral worth\u2014whether Kantian, contractualist, or Scanlonian\u2014cash it out in terms of quality of will. The question is not \u201cWhich psychological token directly energized the arm muscles?\u201d but \u201cWhat quality of will did the action express?\u201d If a de dicto desire is shaped by respect and is sensitive to the content of moral reasons, it expresses a high quality of will. The fact that it is a higher-order desire does not by itself diminish that quality; indeed, it can enhance reliability across contexts where first-order sentiments falter.  \n\nVI. Two Objections and Replies  \n\nObjection 1: Epistemic Alienation. A deliberative de dicto agent is still one step removed from concrete value; she cares about rightness, not people.  \nReply: The objection assumes that \u201ccaring about rightness\u201d is motivationally isolating. But deliberative de dicto desire includes a mandate to *recognize* and *respond to* people\u2019s needs as constitutive of rightness. It therefore integrates, rather than screens off, first-order value. It is analogous to caring about health by caring about whatever physiological states constitute health.  \n\nObjection 2: Motivational Overbreadth. Because the deliberative de dicto desire is content-neutral\u2014ready to act on *whatever* turns out right\u2014it lacks the selectivity that shows genuine attachment to moral features.  \nReply: Selectivity is not always a virtue. We prize generosity over parochial altruism precisely because the former is not tied to familiar faces. Similarly, the breadth of deliberative de dicto desire reveals humility and impartiality: the agent is committed to value wherever it lies, not just where her sentiments happen to gravitate.  \n\nVII. Three Necessary Conditions for Worthy De Dicto Action  \nTo forestall fetishism, dutiful action must satisfy three joint conditions:  \n\n1. Correctness: The agent\u2019s normative belief must in fact align with the right-making features. False moral beliefs vitiate worth even if sincerely acted upon.  \n2. Explanatory Role: The de dicto desire must non-accidentally explain the action. Mere causal accompaniment (e.g., \u201cI also happened to think it was right\u201d) is insufficient.  \n3. Reasons-Responsiveness: Were the underlying moral reasons absent or outweighed, the agent would withhold action. This counters the oracle-obedience model.  \n\nIf these are met, dutiful action earns full moral credit.  \n\nVIII. Why Preferring Concrete Motivations Can Mislead  \nTwo sociological facts cloud the debate. First, empathy comes cheaply in paradigm cases (saving a visible child), so we conflate its motivational vividness with moral worth. Second, many real-world duties\u2014paying wages on time, implementing fair algorithms, preventing climate harms\u2014are too abstract for empathic traction. Here a well-tuned de dicto disposition is indispensable. Our praise practices should not penalize agents whose moral ecology stresses complex duties.  \n\nIX. A Rejoinder to Aristotelian Virtue Ethics  \nVirtue theorists argue that fully developed virtue integrates reason and emotion, so an agent acting *solely* from duty exhibits an impoverished character. Two replies. (a) Diagnostic: the question concerns whether duty can *suffice*, not whether it is *ideal*. I grant that a richer motivational set is preferable; sufficiency is a lower bar. (b) Empirical: in pluralistic societies agents often face emotionally neutral quandaries (e.g., systemic injustices) where Aristotelian sentiment is silent. Duty-based motivation then preserves moral responsiveness. Sufficiency again kicks in.  \n\nX. Implications for Moral Education  \nIf the analysis is right, educators should cultivate both sympathetic and duty-based motivations. The latter acts as a moral \u201cbackstop\u201d when sentiment falters or conflicts. Training agents to reason about rightness\u2014and to care, de dicto, about tracking it\u2014is therefore pedagogically urgent. Far from producing moral robots, it produces resilient moral agents.  \n\nXI. A Final, Counter-Intuitive Benefit  \nBecause de dicto motivation operates at a higher level of abstraction, it is uniquely positioned to correct for biases embedded in our affective systems. Studies in social psychology show empathy vectors toward identifiable victims and in-group members. A commitment to do what is morally right\u2014even when my emotions are silent or counter-suggestive\u2014is a mechanism for justice across distance, anonymity, and time. That seems not fetishistic but laudably vigilant.  \n\nConclusion  \nActing \u201cfrom duty alone\u201d is praiseworthy when the agent\u2019s de dicto desire is deliberative, respect-based, and reasons-responsive. Such a desire is no mere fetish; it is a principled commitment to be guided by exactly the considerations that make actions right, deployed from a vantage point that secures impartiality and reliability. Where those features are in place, duty is not an alien force but a clear lens through which moral reality is seen and acted upon.", "output_tokens": 2364, "reasoning_tokens": 384}

Introduction and Thesis\n\nCritics from Stocker to Wolf have insisted that a merely de dicto desire \u201cto do the morally right thing\u201d cannot ground fully praiseworthy action. They argue that the agent whose sole motive is duty is either morally fetishistic\u2014treating morality itself as a talisman rather than caring about what morality is about\u2014or alienated from the concrete values (welfare, autonomy, justice) that make her action right. I shall defend the contrary view. Acting solely from a de dicto desire to do what is right can be morally worthy, provided that the desire is the right kind: a transparent, higher-order commitment that regulates deliberation by making the agent appropriately sensitive to the concrete right-making features of situations. Such an agent\u2019s praiseworthiness stems from two sources: (i) the epistemic and practical excellence manifested in navigating moral uncertainty through an abstract but content-sensitive principle, and (ii) the expression of respect for morality\u2019s authority, which itself is a morally valuable attitude. This account avoids fetishism and alienation because the de dicto desire governs the agent\u2019s responsiveness to the very concrete considerations critics champion; it does not displace them.\n\n2. Clarifying the Terrain\n\n2.1 De dicto vs. de re moral motivation  \nA de re moral motive is a desire for some specific feature that makes an act right\u2014e.g., the pedestrian\u2019s welfare. A de dicto moral motive is a desire directed at the property of being morally right, without specifying which concrete feature confers that status. An agent can, of course, possess both kinds of desire; the controversy arises when only the de dicto motive is present.\n\n2.2 Moral worth and praiseworthiness  \nFollowing Kant, an act is morally worthy when its motive makes the agent deserving of moral praise, where praise is the fitting response to the agent\u2019s exercise of moral virtue or excellence. Moral worth lies primarily in what the action expresses about the agent\u2019s character and rational capacities, not merely in its consequences.\n\n2.3 Two forms of de dicto desire  \nI propose distinguishing:\n\n\u2022 Opaque de dicto desire: \u201cI want to do whatever is right, full stop,\u201d with no further regulative structure.  \n\u2022 Transparent de dicto desire: \u201cI want my conduct to conform to the set of considerations that actually make actions right.\u201d The desire is higher-order and includes an instruction to discover, track, and be guided by those considerations.\n\nThe opaque form is prone to fetishism; I defend the transparent form.\n\n3. The Standard Anti-Fetishist Argument\n\nThe familiar complaint runs as follows:\n\nPremise 1. Morally worthy action must be motivated by the same substantive considerations that make the action right.  \nPremise 2. A purely de dicto motive is abstract and therefore not the right-making consideration.  \nConclusion. Purely de dicto motivation cannot ground moral worth.\n\nSupport is drawn from several perceived costs:\n\na) Alienation: The dutiful agent seems detached from values people ordinarily care about.  \nb) Coldness: The motive seems affectively thin, lacking compassion or solidarity.  \nc) Bad selectivity: The agent might latch onto any principle she thinks is right, leading to moral mistakes without culpability.\n\n4. A Positive Case for De Dicto Sufficiency\n\n4.1 The functional role of the transparent de dicto desire  \nSuch a desire does not compete with de re motives; it scaffolds them. By aiming to track whatever makes actions right, the higher-order desire organizes inquiry, corrects partiality, and mobilizes instrumental reasoning. It tells the agent: \u201cFind out which concrete considerations are relevant and let them move you.\u201d When this plan is executed competently, the causal pathway from the de dicto desire to action necessarily passes through sensitivity to the concrete right-makers. Hence Premise 1 in the anti-fetishist argument is satisfied: the agent\u2019s decision actually depends on those concrete considerations, albeit indirectly.\n\n4.2 Respect for morality\u2019s authority  \nMorality, if anything, claims authority over our conduct wherever its requirements apply. A stable disposition to treat rightness as action-determining\u2014the core of the de dicto motive\u2014therefore expresses respect for that authority. Respect is itself a morally significant attitude; an action that embodies it is pro tanto worthy of praise.\n\n4.3 Epistemic and practical excellence under uncertainty  \nAgents are often ignorant of the specific right-making features of situations. The transparent de dicto desire provides a regulative ideal that motivates moral inquiry, humility about one\u2019s own biases, and resolution in the face of normative complexity. These are virtues. An action that issues from them, even if affectively cool, can manifest a distinctive moral reliability\u2014the capacity to do the right thing across varying contexts\u2014which is intuitively praiseworthy.\n\n5. Illustrative Cases\n\nCase 1: Foggy Rescue  \nA hiker hears cries from dense fog. She cannot tell whether it is a human or an animal nor what help is required. She asks herself, \u201cWhat is the right thing here?\u201d Deciding that investigating is morally obligatory, she proceeds. Her motive is simply to do whatever is right; she lacks any concrete benevolent emotion toward whoever cries out. Yet her deliberation is praiseworthy: it acknowledges moral uncertainty, commits to resolving it, and drives her to undertake the rescue. The transparent de dicto desire did all the work.\n\nCase 2: The Exhausted Doctor  \nA triage physician at the end of a 48-hour shift feels numb. She no longer feels direct compassion toward the endless line of patients; what keeps her going is a single thought: \u201cThese people have a right to care and it is my duty to provide it.\u201d Her continuing to treat patients diligently is morally admirable, not fetishistic. The de dicto motive sustains moral performance when affective de re motives are drained.\n\nCase 3: The Mercenary-Turned-Kantian  \nA former soldier, habituated to obeying orders, adopts the maxim \u201cAct only according to that principle you can will as universal law.\u201d He now refuses lucrative assassination contracts even when the prospective target is vicious. He has little love for the victims. Praiseworthiness here derives from self-governance by an impartial moral principle that systematizes respect for persons.\n\nThese cases show that the de dicto motive (i) can recruit sensitivity to the morally relevant facts once they are discovered (Foggy Rescue), (ii) can sustain right action when ordinary affective motives fail (Exhausted Doctor), and (iii) can correct prior immoral habits (Mercenary). In each, the action is morally worthy even though concrete concern is absent or secondary.\n\n6. Replying to the Main Objections\n\n6.1 Fetishism  \nThe fetishism charge presumes the agent treats \u201crightness\u201d as a mysterious good independent of its grounds. That worry targets the opaque form of de dicto desire. But a transparent higher-order desire is conceptually structured to be mediated by right-making reasons; it therefore cannot be a fetish.\n\nAnalogy: a scientist\u2019s de dicto desire to \u201cbelieve what is true\u201d is not epistemic fetishism. It organizes her inquiry into de re truths. Similarly, wanting one\u2019s conduct to be \u201cmorally right\u201d is not moral fetishism if it organizes inquiry into justice, welfare, autonomy, etc.\n\n6.2 Alienation from value  \nAlienation is avoided because the agent\u2019s deliberative route inevitably includes acknowledging right-making considerations. She may not feel warmth, but affective empathy is only one way of being related to value; cognitive recognition and voluntary responsiveness suffice for respect.\n\nMoreover, ordinary moral life includes roles\u2014judges, auditors, safety inspectors\u2014where personal concern is inappropriate. Their detached but principle-governed motives are widely regarded as virtuous precisely because they prevent favoritism.\n\n6.3 Coldness and motivational richness  \nPraiseworthiness does not scale with emotional vividness. Over-reliance on sympathy can produce morally regrettable partiality. The de dicto motive delivers impartial coverage while being compatible with, though not dependent on, sympathetic feelings. A balanced moral psychology may contain both kinds of motives; my claim is only sufficiency, not exclusivity.\n\n6.4 Bad selectivity: \u201cBut the agent might pick the wrong morality\u201d  \nTrue, epistemic failure is possible. Yet the same is true for de re motives: compassion can be ill-informed or misdirected. What matters are the agent\u2019s deliberative virtues\u2014careful evidence gathering, openness to criticism\u2014not the mere type of motive. When the transparent de dicto desire is executed with those virtues, mistakes are culpability-mitigated in the familiar way.\n\n7. Comparative Dialectic: De Re Alone vs. De Dicto Alone\n\nSuppose we contrast two minimalist agents:\n\n\u2022 Warm Sam: moved solely by compassion for whomever he can vividly imagine.  \n\u2022 Duty Dana: moved solely by the transparent de dicto desire.\n\nSam performs praiseworthy acts in salient emergencies but ignores distant harms he cannot picture. Dana donates to effective charities after reading cost-effectiveness studies. Which is morally worthier? Not obviously Sam. The comparison suggests that a purely de re motive can fall short on universality and deliberative rectitude, whereas a purely de dicto motive can excel in those respects.\n\n8. A Hybrid Picture and Its Normative Edge\n\nThe debate often assumes a zero-sum competition: either concrete care or abstract duty. But empirical psychology indicates that human motivation is plural and context-sensitive. The transparent de dicto desire can function as a regulatory controller that triggers, coordinates, or substitutes for various de re motives. On this view:\n\n\u2022 When sympathy is available and reliable, the higher-order desire licenses acting from it.  \n\u2022 When sympathy conflicts with impartial moral reasons (e.g., nepotism), the de dicto desire overrides.  \n\u2022 When sympathy is absent (Exhausted Doctor), the desire itself motivates right action.\n\nRather than being redundant, the de dicto motive is the glue that integrates our motivational economy into a coherent moral agency. Its praiseworthiness lies in manifesting the virtue of practical wisdom\u2014phronesis\u2014under conditions of motivational heterogeneity.\n\n9. Wider Implications\n\n9.1 Moral education  \nTeaching children merely to \u201ccare about others\u201d risks partial compassion; teaching them also to \u201cdo what is right\u201d instills a regulative framework that scales with growing cognitive capacities.\n\n9.2 Moral testimony and deference  \nA transparent de dicto desire justifies moral deference to experts when one lacks direct understanding. Critics of moral deference worry about alienation; but my account treats testimony as a rational extension of the desire to align with rightness under epistemic limitation.\n\n9.3 Collective agents and institutions  \nInstitutions lack affect. Yet we want them to act rightly. What motivates them, metaphorically speaking, is a de dicto desire instantiated in rules and procedures responsive to right-making reasons (justice, efficiency, rights). Hence institutional morality vindicates the sufficiency claim.\n\n10. Novel Insight: De Dicto Desire as Second-Personal Commitment\n\nStephen Darwall argues that moral obligations are irreducibly second-personal: they arise from relations in which one can address claims to another. The transparent de dicto desire can be reframed as a standing second-personal commitment: I desire to do what any addressee could legitimately demand of me. That structure inherently encodes responsiveness to the concrete interests of moral fellows without requiring the motivational texture of empathy. This synthesis deflects both fetishism (because the desire is relational, not object-directed at a fetish) and alienation (because its content is precisely others\u2019 authority).\n\n11. Potential Limitations and Further Questions\n\nMy argument establishes sufficiency, not necessity. Some actions may lack moral worth if performed exclusively from duty\u2014e.g., spontaneous loving generosity arguably loses something when overtaken by sober obligation. Further work must articulate when de re motives confer incremental worth over the baseline provided by duty.\n\nAdditionally, cultural variance in how people conceive \u201cmorality\u201d may affect how the de dicto desire functions; in communities with distorted moral codes, the desire may misfire. Addressing this requires coupling the desire with virtues of critical reflection and openness to moral progress\u2014features I have tacitly assumed.\n\n12. Conclusion\n\nAn exclusive focus on concrete benevolent motives underestimates the moral value of higher-order, principle-governed agency. When an agent\u2019s sole motive is a transparent de dicto desire to do what is morally right, and when that desire operates through competent deliberation that tracks right-making reasons, her action is morally worthy. The praiseworthiness derives from respect for moral authority, from practical and epistemic virtues manifested under uncertainty, and from the agent\u2019s reliable sensitivity to the very values the anti-fetishist camp wishes to honor. Far from being a mere fallback or an alienating fetish, acting from duty can be an exemplary expression of mature moral agency.", "output_tokens": 3236, "reasoning_tokens": 448}

Introduction and Thesis  \n\nWhen we praise an agent for acting well, we usually want to say that she acted \u201cfor the right reasons.\u201d  But what exactly must figure in her motivational set?  One influential view\u2014going back to Aristotle and revived by contemporary sentimentalists and neo-Aristotelians\u2014holds that she must be moved by the very considerations that make her act right: the friend\u2019s need, the stranger\u2019s pain, the promisee\u2019s reliance.  A mere abstract desire to \u201cdo the morally right thing\u201d smells, to these critics, like moral fetishism: the agent\u2019s gaze is fixed on moral rectitude itself rather than on the concrete goods morality is supposed to protect.  \n\nI shall defend the contrary thesis: a purely de dicto desire to do what is morally right can by itself ground full moral worth, provided it is embedded in a certain kind of practical competence.  What makes such dutiful action praiseworthy is not the presence of warm moral sentiments, but the exercise of a self-regulating capacity to reliably track moral reasons across situations\u2014call it moral self-governance.  When that capacity is manifested, acting from duty is neither fetishistic nor alienating; rather, it is the distinctive way finite, fallible agents can respect the moral law while acknowledging the limits of their epistemic access to right-making features.  \n\nI proceed as follows.  \u00a72 clarifies the de dicto / de re distinction and the fetishism complaint.  \u00a73 argues that moral worth is primarily a matter of exercising self-governance, and that a de dicto motive can manifest this exercise.  \u00a74 develops two further, non-Kantian advantages of the de dicto motive\u2014epistemic humility and value-integrative robustness\u2014that the de re view undervalues.  \u00a75 replies to four standard objections (alienation, coldness, motivational weakness, and the \u201cdutiful robot\u201d).  \u00a76 synthesises these points into a competence account of praiseworthiness and illustrates it with a pair of cases.  \u00a77 concludes.\n\n2. Duty, De Dicto Motivation, and the Charge of Fetishism  \n\nLet us mark two contrasts.\n\na) De dicto vs. de re desire.  To want, de re, to help Sarah is to be motivationally keyed to Sarah herself.  To want, de dicto, to do \u201cwhatever is morally right in these circumstances\u201d is to be keyed to the rightness property, whatever token instantiates it.\n\nb) Right-making vs. motivating reasons.  The fact that Sarah is in pain may make helping her obligatory.  Whether that fact also operates as the agent\u2019s motivating reason is a further question.\n\nThe fetishism objection (Smith 1994; Railton 2006; Arpaly 2003) alleges the following:\n\n1. Morality is about concrete values (welfare, autonomy, etc.).\n2. The de dicto motive ignores those values and focuses on rightness itself.\n3. Therefore it is fetishistic\u2014like loving someone solely because she is \u201cthe legally recognised spouse,\u201d not because of her own qualities.\n4. Because of this mismatch, dutiful action lacks full moral worth.\n\nProponents of the fetishism charge often invoke everyday phenomenology.  The Good Samaritan, they say, rushes to aid not because \u201chelping is required,\u201d but because the wounded man bleeds.\n\n3. Moral Worth, Self-Governance, and the De Dicto Motive  \n\nKant famously claims that nothing is unconditionally good except a good will\u2014one that acts \u201cfrom duty.\u201d  Critics counter that Kant mistakes a secondary motive (respect for law) for the primary motive (concern for persons).  We can grant that respect for persons supplies the content of the moral law yet still ask: what kind of psychological state constitutes acting \u201cfor the sake of that law\u201d?  \n\nMy proposal: moral worth consists in the agent\u2019s successful exercise of moral self-governance, where this is a disposition\n\n(i) to take the set of moral reasons as providing decisive practical guidance,  \n(ii) to identify correctly what those reasons require, and  \n(iii) to conform action to that requirement because it so requires.\n\nAll three elements matter.  (i) supplies the de dicto end: do what morality requires.  (ii) introduces a cognitive component: the requirement must be tracked correctly (fallible but non-accidentally).  (iii) ensures motivational efficacy.  When these conditions are satisfied, the action is praiseworthy\u2014even if no de re sentiment toward the beneficiary plays a motivating role\u2014because the agent\u2019s will is governed by the authority of moral reasons themselves.  \n\nWhy should that count as praiseworthy?  Two considerations:\n\nA. Autonomy of reason.  To treat moral considerations as decisive just because they are moral is to acknowledge them as reasons that apply to one\u2019s will irrespective of inclination.  Exercising that capacity realises a form of autonomy that is central to our most basic moral practices of praise and blame.  Blame condemns failures of governance; praise recognises its successful exercise.\n\nB. Reliability across contexts.  The de dicto disposition is portable.  A lover of animals may reliably refrain from cruelty to dogs but forget fish; someone committed to moral rightness per se will generalise across cases, provided her deliberative competence is intact.\n\n4. Two Further Virtues of the De Dicto Motive  \n\n4.1 Epistemic Humility  \n\nAgents are often ignorant of the actual right-making features of their situations.  Consider Sophie, a doctor in triage.  She can neither fully probe each patient\u2019s prospects nor fully weigh their social roles.  What she can do is resolve: \u201cI shall do what justice in allocation requires.\u201d  This second-order commitment is not a substitute for trying to discern first-order facts; it is the practical stance that keeps her deliberation anchored to whatever those facts turn out to be.  The de dicto motive thus honours epistemic humility: when you do not know precisely what makes an act right, the best you can do is aim at rightness itself.  By contrast, a purely de re sentimental motive risks misfiring: affectionate concern may privilege the wrong patient if the true right-maker is, say, prognosis or prior claim.\n\n4.2 Value-Integrative Robustness  \n\nMoral life is pluralistic.  Altruistic concern, respect for autonomy, fairness, special obligations, and so on push in different directions.  A de re motive locks on to whichever of these considerations happens to grip the agent most immediately.  Over time, that can produce a patchwork of inconsistent responsiveness.  By contrast, the de dicto stance functions as an integrator: it instructs the agent to adjudicate among competing first-order values according to their moral weight, not according to their affective salience.\n\nHence the supposed deficit of abstraction is in fact a resource: it prevents any single first-order concern from hijacking the deliberation, thereby promoting a balanced response to the full structure of moral reasons.\n\n5. Four Objections Revisited  \n\nObjection 1: Alienation.  Acting from duty estranges the agent from the concrete value of, say, her child\u2019s well-being.\n\nReply: Nothing in the competence account forbids the agent to feel love.  It claims only that love is not required for moral worth.  Indeed, in contexts where love conflicts with impartial duties (e.g., favouring one\u2019s child over many strangers in life-boat cases), the de dicto motive prevents wrongful partiality.  Far from alienating, it secures the agent\u2019s allegiance to the morally significant features in their proper proportion.\n\nObjection 2: Coldness.  Praiseworthy action should display warmth; the dutiful agent seems icy.\n\nReply: Warmth is aesthetically pleasing, but moral worth tracks normative governance, not interpersonal temperature.  We admire the steady, principled judge more than the mercurial empath who sways with feelings.  Moreover, motivational warmth can be reconstructed as evidence of reliable governance in many ordinary cases; it is not constitutive of it.\n\nObjection 3: Motivational weakness.  A mere abstract desire to do right is too etiolated to overcome strong counter-incentives.\n\nReply: This is an empirical prediction, not a conceptual point.  The historical record (e.g., whistle-blowers who sacrifice careers) shows that principled commitment can exhibit extraordinary motivational strength.  Besides, sentimental motives can also be weak: sympathy evaporates under stress.  Strength depends on how deeply the motive is integrated into the agent\u2019s identity, not on whether it is de re or de dicto.\n\nObjection 4: The Dutiful Robot.  Imagine a perfectly programmed android whose only desire is de dicto rightness and who unfailingly computes it.  Do we praise the robot?  If not, de dicto desire seems insufficient.\n\nReply: What is missing in the robot is not the de re affect but the capacity for autonomous self-governance under the moral law\u2014i.e., the very exercise of practical rationality that grounds responsibility.  The competence account can therefore say: the android lacks moral worth because it lacks the rational agency conditions that make praise apt, not because its motive is too abstract.\n\n6. Toward a Competence Account of Praiseworthiness  \n\nWe can now articulate the positive proposal:\n\nAn action has moral worth iff  \n(1) the agent is guided by a de dicto practical commitment to comply with moral requirements;  \n(2) she exercises sufficient deliberative competence to form a non-accidental, correct judgement about what morality requires in the circumstances; and  \n(3) she succeeds in acting on that judgement.\n\nCondition (2) avoids deviant causal chains and lucky guesses; it makes moral worth responsive to the agent\u2019s epistemic situation.  It also answers the \u201cfetishism\u201d concern: because the agent\u2019s judgement must accurately track the right-making reasons, she is not indifferent to them; they figure in her appreciation even if not as separate first-order motives.\n\nTwo contrasting cases illustrate.\n\nCase A: Junction John.  Driving in a storm, John sees a stranger\u2019s car skid.  He thinks, \u201cHelping is the morally right thing; therefore I must.\u201d  He pulls over, his deliberation sound.  Though he feels no sympathy (he is emotionally exhausted), he scores high on the three conditions.  We rightly praise him.\n\nCase B: Reactive Ren.  Ren is flooded with empathy for the skidding driver and stops.  Unbeknownst to him, stopping blocks the only path for an ambulance.  Because Ren never weighed competing duties, his act is wrong.  His warm motive does not spare him from blame.\n\nThe comparison reveals that moral worth tracks reliable responsiveness to moral reasons, not their affective colouration.\n\n7. Conclusion  \n\nThe fetishism charge relies on a too-narrow picture of what motivation must look like to manifest moral concern.  By focusing on first-order sentimental alignment, it overlooks the second-order structure of our normative agency: finite creatures must often act under uncertainty and value conflict.  A de dicto commitment to do whatever morality requires, when coupled with competent deliberation, is the mechanism that allows us to steer through these obstacles.  Far from being a cold, alien abstraction, it is the practical expression of respect for the authority of moral reasons in their entirety.  When that self-governing capacity is exercised, action is fully praiseworthy\u2014even if no single right-making feature supplied the agent with a de re motivational push.  Acting from duty, then, need not be morally second-best; properly understood, it is the paradigm of moral worth.", "output_tokens": 2934, "reasoning_tokens": 448}

On the account I shall defend, what makes such dutiful action praiseworthy is not the presence of some further benevolent, sympathetic, or otherwise \u201csubstantive\u201d motive, but the way a de dicto orientation toward \u201cthe right\u201d manifests a distinctive value: second-personal respect for persons as such. When an agent reliably does what morality requires because it is required\u2014and does so in a manner that is reasons-responsive and epistemically conscientious\u2014her conduct embodies the very point of the moral enterprise rather than being alienated from it.  \n\nMy argument proceeds in six steps. (1) I clarify the target: what it is to act \u201csolely from duty\u201d and why that motive is thought objectionable. (2) I expose a conceptual conflation in the standard critique between the content of a motivating desire and the considerations that justify acting on it. (3) I develop a \u201crespect-first\u201d account on which a de dicto moral motive suffices for moral worth because it realizes the core moral attitude of honoring others\u2019 authority over how one may act toward them. (4) I answer three leading objections: the fetishism objection (Smith), the alienation objection (Stocker, Wolf), and the \u201cwrong-reason\u201d objection (e.g., Arpaly). (5) I illustrate the view with two cases that disentangle duty from sympathy and from self-interest. (6) I conclude with some implications for moral education and moral psychology.\n\n1. Why Duty Looks Suspicious  \n\nKantians famously claim that only actions done \u201cfrom duty\u201d possess moral worth, yet a host of critics insist that the duty motive is too abstract to ground praise. The intuitive idea is easy to state. Compare:\n\nAltruistic Nurse: Sophia donates her Saturday to vaccinate children because she cares about their welfare.  \nScrupulous Nurse: Adrian donates the same Saturday solely because he believes doing so is morally required.\n\nMany judge Sophia the more admirable. They worry that Adrian\u2019s attitude is one of moral fetishism (Smith): he attaches intrinsic value to a property\u2014being morally permissible\u2014that is valuable only derivatively; or of alienation (Stocker): he fails to be \u201cfor\u201d the very values morality is about (health, flourishing, etc.). The underlying assumption is that moral worth requires motivational continuity with the concrete reasons that make an action right, not with an abstract de dicto desire.\n\nYet the assumption rests on two questionable premises:\n\nP1. A de dicto desire to do what is right cannot embody concern for the values that make actions right.  \nP2. Moral worth consists in being moved directly by those values.\n\nI shall reject P1 and qualify P2.\n\n2. Clearing a Conceptual Tangle  \n\nThe debate trades on an ambiguity between the justificatory and the motivational roles of reasons. To be motivated by a consideration C is not the same as recognizing C as the justification for one\u2019s act. The shopkeeper in Kant\u2019s famous example sells at fair prices because it is good for business; he is motivated by self-interest, but he may still believe\u2014and even accurately state\u2014that fairness is what justifies fair pricing. Conversely, one can be motivated by duty\u2014even \u201csolely\u201d by it\u2014while transparently acknowledging that others\u2019 welfare is why duty requires what it does. The de dicto desire functions as a practical directive: \u201cDo whatever morality demands.\u201d To execute that directive, the agent must track the right-making features in situ; otherwise she will not know what morality demands. Hence a competent duty-motive is necessarily world-sensitive.\n\nCritics often depict the duty-bound agent as heedless of the concrete. But that depiction conflates motivational priority with informational input. My desire \u201cto keep promises\u201d directs me to ask which acts count as promise-keeping; answering that question forces attention to promissory practices, the expectations of promisees, and so on. Likewise, a general desire \u201cto do what is right\u201d does not bypass, but rather mobilizes, engagement with the very values that make particular acts right. The upshot is that P1 is false: a de dicto motive can embed a concern for underlying values through its deliberative implementation.\n\n3. A Respect-First Account of Moral Worth  \n\nWe can now frame a positive proposal. The duty motive, when properly structured, is valuable because it realizes a distinctive moral attitude: respect. As Stephen Darwall argues, morality is fundamentally second-personal; it is about what persons can reasonably demand of one another. To act from duty is to acknowledge those demands\u2019 authority over one\u2019s will. What earns praise is not mainly that the agent benefits others, but that she acknowledges their standing as equal co-legislators of norms. Call this the Respect Principle:\n\nRP: An action possesses moral worth if and only if it issues from a reliable, reasons-responsive disposition to comply with valid moral requirements out of recognition of their authoritative status, where that recognition expresses respect for the persons whose claims constitute the requirements.\n\nRP renders a de dicto motive sufficient because \u201crecognition of authoritative status\u201d just is the desire-cum-commitment to do what is morally required. Sympathy may deepen the psychological ease of moral action, but it is neither necessary nor sufficient for respect. (One can help from pity that demeans; one can refuse wrongdoing though emotionally indifferent.)\n\nWhy, then, prefer RP to the \u201cvalue-first\u201d view that motives should track concrete goods like welfare? Because welfare, fairness, autonomy, etc. enter moral deliberation under the guise of what persons may rightly expect of one another. Acting \u201cfor the sake of those values\u201d without acknowledging their claim on one\u2019s will does not yet relate to others in the normative register morality governs. Respect is thus the constitutive moral attitude.\n\n4. Answering the Objections  \n\n4.1 The Fetishism Objection  \n\nMichael Smith likens the duty motive to a fetish: an abnormal fixation on a property valued only because it predicts deeper goods. Yet respect is not an abnormal fixation; it is the appropriate stance toward beings with authority to address claims to us. To call it \u201cfetishistic\u201d is to treat persons\u2019 normative authority as dispensable. But once we see morality as an interpersonal practice of accountability, the fixation flips from pathological to fitting. The purported fetish is more like fidelity to a promise: attachment to the norm precisely at the point where its content binds us.\n\n4.2 The Alienation Objection  \n\nStocker worries that a duty-bound agent is alienated from friends, lovers, or patients, because she helps them \u201cfor the sake of duty\u201d rather than out of love. But RP does not forbid additional motives; it only requires that, if other motives fade, the agent\u2019s respect-based commitment remains. Imagine a fatigued physician who no longer feels fresh compassion yet continues to treat patients conscientiously because it is her duty to them as persons. Far from alienated, she honors them by refusing to let fluctuating emotion dictate their care. Alienation arises only when the duty motive crowds out all other attachments. That is a psychological hazard, not a conceptual necessity.\n\n4.3 The Wrong-Reason Objection  \n\nNomy Arpaly and others note that one can do the right thing \u201cfrom duty\u201d while being epistemically negligent or dogmatic\u2014for example, the over-scrupulous vegetarian who refuses animal products not because she understands animal suffering but because \u201cthe moral law demands it,\u201d parroting authorities. Such cases have low moral worth. RP explains why: moral worth requires a reasons-responsive disposition. Dogmatism short-circuits responsiveness; therefore it fails the sufficiency condition. Once reasons-responsiveness is built in, the objection dissolves.\n\n5. Two Cases That Test the View  \n\nCase 1: The Tempted Whistle-blower  \n\nDana discovers that her employer is dumping toxins. She feels no personal sympathy for the distant villagers affected; indeed exposing the wrongdoing will cost her friends and job security. Nevertheless, she reports the crime because \u201cit is the morally right thing to do.\u201d She conscientiously reviews the evidence to ensure accuracy, anticipates counterarguments, and acts. According to RP her act has full moral worth: Dana defers to the villagers\u2019 claim not to be poisoned, a claim that overrides her convenience. Her de dicto motive does not belittle their welfare; it treats that welfare as normatively authoritative over her.\n\nCase 2: The Warm-hearted Racist  \n\nBen volunteers at a homeless shelter because he feels strong compassion. Unfortunately, he refuses to serve immigrant families, believing they \u201ctake welfare from real citizens.\u201d His sympathy is selective. When challenged, he answers, \u201cI help the truly deserving because I care about them.\u201d Ben\u2019s actions that do help some homeless people are good, but they lack the moral worth of Dana\u2019s whistle-blowing. His benevolence is not guided by a respect-based commitment to equal moral claims; it is contingent on partial feelings. The cases illustrate that duty can ground praise where sympathy cannot, and that concrete motives ungoverned by the moral law can undermine worth.\n\n6. Implications and Conclusion  \n\nIf the respect-first account is right, three consequences follow:\n\na) Moral education should cultivate, alongside empathy, a capacity for principled responsiveness: the habit of asking \u201cWhat is the morally permissible course?\u201d and acting on the answer even when emotion falters.\n\nb) The traditional Kantian verdict that only dutiful action has moral worth is defensible once \u201cduty\u201d is read as respect for persons, not as focus on an abstract property detached from their claims.\n\nc) The debate about moral fetishism hinges on a mischaracterization. The de dicto duty motive is not a fetish but the structural core of moral agency; it secures allegiance to whatever concrete values are, in fact, morally authoritative.\n\nIn sum: Acting solely from the desire to do what is morally right suffices for moral worth whenever that desire is instantiated as a reasons-responsive commitment that expresses respect for persons\u2019 normative authority. Such action is praiseworthy because it epitomizes the moral point: acknowledging others as ends in themselves. Far from betraying a fetishistic or alienated stance, the dutiful agent stands in the very relation of accountability that gives morality its distinctive significance.", "output_tokens": 2786, "reasoning_tokens": 576}

Setting the Stage  \n\nA century of moral psychology has made one thing vivid: people can do the right thing for very different reasons. I check on my elderly neighbour because I enjoy her company; you do so because you pity her; a third person does so because Kant taught that helping those in need is a perfect duty. The present debate asks whether that last person can earn full moral credit if the only motive in play is a de dicto desire\u2014\u201cto do what is morally right, whatever that is.\u201d  Many philosophers (from Slote to Smith to Arpaly) object that such an agent is a \u201cmoral fetishist,\u201d someone whose eyes never leave the austere abstraction \u201crightness,\u201d and who therefore fails to respond to what morality is really about\u2014people\u2019s concrete needs, suffering, and flourishing.  \n\nMy thesis is that acting solely from the motive of duty can indeed suffice for moral worth, provided the motive is understood correctly.  A de dicto moral desire is not a motivational black hole; it is a higher-order practical commitment that (i) is necessarily rooted in responsiveness to the very right-making features that critics fear it neglects, and (ii) manifests a valuable second-order stance toward one\u2019s own agency\u2014namely, a principled readiness to let moral reasons govern.  When those two conditions are met, dutiful action is praiseworthy even if no independent de re concern (e.g. sympathy) is present.  The hostile label \u201cfetishism\u201d gains its bite only from an empirically implausible and conceptually confused picture of what de dicto motivation must be.  \n\nThe argument unfolds as follows.  \u00a72 clarifies the distinction between de dicto and de re moral motivation and diagnoses why the fetishism worry seems tempting.  \u00a73 shows that any minimally reflective de dicto desire is unavoidably tethered to an appreciation of right-making considerations, defeating the charge of concrete blindness.  \u00a74 explains why the higher-order structure of duty-motivation adds moral worth by expressing the agent\u2019s practical autonomy and equal respect for all persons.  \u00a75 rebuts three leading objections: the \u201cempathy deficit,\u201d the \u201ccold-hearted benefactor,\u201d and the \u201caccidental rightness\u201d challenges.  \u00a76 closes by articulating a new dispositional criterion that reconciles duty-based moral worth with the intuitive importance of substantive moral emotions.\n\n2. De dicto vs. De re: A Distinction Too Quickly Drawn  \n\nThe de dicto/de re distinction comes from philosophy of mind and language.  To want de dicto to do what is right is to desire an act under the description \u201cright,\u201d with no further specification.  To want de re to relieve Ms. Nguyen\u2019s loneliness is to be motivated by that concrete aspect of the situation.  Critics claim that only the latter kind of desire \u201chooks onto\u201d the true reasons for action.  But two premature conclusions often slide in unnoticed:\n\nA. The Over-Formalization Thesis:  A purely de dicto desire is content-thin; therefore, it cannot discriminate between right-making and wrong-making features.  It is like a heat-seeking missile that locks onto whichever target its guidance system labels \u201chot,\u201d indifferent to what the heat really is.\n\nB. The Alienation Thesis:  Because the desire is fixed on a moral abstraction, the agent is detached from what morality is about\u2014namely, the well-being of creatures who can suffer.  Her beneficence is thus cold or inauthentic.\n\nBoth theses assume that a de dicto motive operates in isolation from any grasp of the moral landscape.  Yet this is psychologically unlikely and, more important, conceptually unnecessary.  Nothing about the formal description \u201cdoing what is right\u201d rules out knowing what makes things right; indeed, as we shall see, some such knowledge is required to form an all-things-considered judgment that an act is right.  The critic therefore owes us an argument for why de dicto motivation must be blind or alienating rather than seamlessly integrated with a grasp of concrete moral grounds.\n\n3. Why De dicto Duty Necessarily Tracks Concrete Moral Reasons  \n\nConsider how practical deliberation actually proceeds in the head of a conscientious agent:\n\nStep 1: She surveys the non-moral facts\u2014Ms. Nguyen is isolated, visits alleviate loneliness, doing so costs little.  \nStep 2: She consults her moral standards (principles, intuitions, role-conceptions) and arrives at a verdict: visiting is morally required.  \nStep 3: The higher-order desire \u201cto do the right thing\u201d couples with that verdict to produce action.\n\nNotice two features.  First, the verdict in Step 2 depends on weighing exactly the concrete facts the critic says are ignored.  Having the de dicto desire is useless until one figures out what is right, and figuring that out requires sensitivity to others\u2019 welfare, autonomy, desert, and so on.  The motivational structure therefore guarantees\u2014not incidentally but constitutively\u2014that the right-making considerations are cognitively consulted.  \n\nSecond, the agent\u2019s motivational affection can run entirely through the de dicto desire without erasing this cognitive sensitivity.  She need not also feel warmth or empathy toward Ms. Nguyen; what moves her bodily to walk next door is the thought \u201cthis is morally required.\u201d  Still, had the welfare facts been different\u2014say the visit would exacerbate Ms. Nguyen\u2019s trauma\u2014her moral verdict would switch, and so would her action.  The \u201cguidance system\u201d therefore locks onto welfare differences in the way that matters: it performs the right-making tracking function.\n\nThe fetishism charge confuses direct motivational content with evidential uptake.  An epistemically conscientious scientist values truth de dicto\u2014she wants true beliefs, whatever they are\u2014but that desire forces her to attend to concrete evidence, not ignore it.  Analogously, the conscientious moral agent\u2019s de dicto desire forces her to attend to concrete moral evidence.  Moral fetishism, if it exists, would require someone who both (i) desires to do what\u2019s right and (ii) refuses to look at what makes things right; but (i) and (ii) are in tension.  Once we see this, the over-formalization thesis collapses.\n\n4. The Higher-Order Value of Dutiful Agency  \n\nIf a de dicto motive already involves due sensitivity to concrete moral reasons, what extra contribution could it make to moral worth?  My answer: it confers a distinctive kind of practical self-governance.  Two ideas are crucial.\n\n4.1  Moral Obedience as Second-Order Endorsement  \nThe de dicto desire is best understood as a second-order commitment: \u201cI will allow whatever turns out to be morally required to override other projects.\u201d  This stance expresses recognition of morality\u2019s authority over the self, a form of respect sometimes called \u201cacknowledgement respect.\u201d  Acting from duty therefore showcases a valuable meta-attitude: a willingness to treat all persons (oneself included) as objects of impartial moral consideration.  That willingness is praiseworthy because it constitutes the agent as a moral equal among equals, rather than as someone who helps only when it pleases her sympathies or aligns with her projects.\n\n4.2  Reliability Across Variation  \nBecause the de dicto motive plugs directly into moral verdicts, it promises a robustness ordinary sympathy lacks.  The beneficent sentimentalist may help Ms. Nguyen but not Mr. Ogun in the next apartment if she dislikes his gruff demeanor.  The dutiful agent helps both, provided the moral reasons are identical.  This counterfactual reliability is what Kant had in mind when he spoke of actions \u201cfrom duty\u201d having a special moral worth.\n\nA quick illustration:  A climate-controlled space station loses power.  The sentimentalist happily helps ventilate the habitat where her friends live but not the one where strangers live; her empathy is weaker there.  The dutiful agent, hearing that all habitats face lethal temperatures, methodically apportions aid according to need.  The de dicto motive\u2019s impartial structure is what underwrites that even-handed response.\n\n5. Objections and Replies  \n\n5.1  The Empathy Deficit Objection  \n\u201cSurely,\u201d says the critic, \u201can agent who saves a child without feeling any concern for her suffering is less praiseworthy than one moved by compassion.\u201d  I grant the comparative claim but deny the sufficiency inference.  Moral worth is not a zero-sum race for first prize; multiple motivational structures can each reach the threshold of praiseworthiness.  Compassion may add an extra layer of value\u2014call it the expressive virtue of fellow feeling\u2014but the absence of that layer does not evaporate the worth already secured by dutiful self-governance.\n\nAnalogy: a mathematician who proves a theorem for its own sake is admirable.  One who also feels aesthetic rapture at the proof is even more so.  Yet the first mathematician\u2019s achievement remains praiseworthy.\n\n5.2  The Cold-Hearted Benefactor Objection  \nSuppose an agent helps others only reluctantly, complaining \u201cI wish morality demanded less of me.\u201d  Is that action truly worthy?  Here we must distinguish motivational source from accompanying attitude.  The presence of grouchiness may reduce moral worth because it signals grudging compliance, but not because the underlying motive is de dicto.  A grouchy empath is also less admirable than a joyful empath.  The right conclusion is that ancillary attitudes modulate moral worth; they do not make duty-motive per se defective.\n\n5.3  The Accidental Rightness Objection  \n\u201cCouldn\u2019t an agent fetishising \u2018rightness\u2019 latch onto a mistaken moral belief and do terrible things, all the while acting from duty?\u201d  Two points.  First, moral worth tracks the reasons the agent actually possesses, not the objective facts she fails to know.  A carefully deliberating but misinformed agent may still be praiseworthy if her error is excusable.  Second, the same problem arises for de re sympathy: one might help someone in ways that are secretly harmful.  Fallibility is a universal human condition, not a special flaw of duty-motivation.\n\n6. A New Dispositional Criterion: Principled Sensitivity  \n\nThe above defenses may still leave a residual unease: empathy seems to manifest direct concern for people, whereas de dicto duty feels mediated, almost bureaucratic.  To capture what is right in that intuition without abandoning the sufficiency of duty, I propose a dispositional criterion for praiseworthy duty:  \n\nPrincipled Sensitivity:  A de dicto-motivated agent is morally worthy only if she is disposed to (i) seek out the right-making facts, (ii) revise her moral verdicts in light of new evidence, and (iii) cultivate cognitive and affective capacities that improve such responsiveness.  \n\nThis criterion does two things.  First, it rules out the caricatured fetishist who worships \u201crightness\u201d while studiously avoiding contact with human need.  Such an agent fails condition (i).  Second, it explains why many de dicto agents naturally develop a repertoire of emotions\u2014sympathy, guilt, indignation\u2014not as competing motives but as epistemic tools that help satisfy (i)-(iii).  On this view, empathy\u2019s value is partially instrumental: it sharpens our perception of others\u2019 welfare.  A duty-bound agent lacking all affect may be praiseworthy in principle, but in our actual cognitive ecology she will rarely meet the sensitivity requirement.\n\nCompare morality with chess.  To value \u201cmaking the right move\u201d de dicto is compatible with (indeed, conducive to) studying openings, memorizing endgames, and cultivating an aesthetic sense for elegant combinations.  Similarly, valuing right action motivates a wise agent to enrich her motivational palette, not impoverish it.  The fetishist worry arises only if we imagine an agent who paradoxically refuses the very tools that would help her track moral reasons.\n\n7. Reconciling Anti-Alienation Intuitions  \n\nFinally, does dutiful action alienate us from what morality is \u201creally about\u201d?  Here is a conciliatory diagnosis.  What anti-fetishists rightly sense is that morality has a point: promoting the flourishing of sentient beings.  They fear that the abstraction \u201crightness\u201d can float free of that point, becoming an idol.  My dispositional account shows why the idol image is misleading: a genuine commitment to rightness cannot float free because its deliberative content is anchored in flourishing; to judge that something is right is already to see it as serving persons\u2019 autonomy, welfare, or dignity.  The agent who seeks rightness therefore reaffirms, rather than obscures, morality\u2019s point.  \n\nIf you worry that the language of \u201cduty\u201d sounds cold, imagine resituating it in second-person discourse: \u201cI owe you this.\u201d  To act from duty is precisely to let that normative fact, owed to another, govern one\u2019s will.  Far from alienating, it is the form of agency that takes the other\u2019s claim most seriously.\n\n8. Conclusion  \n\nActing solely from the motive of duty can suffice for moral worth because:\n\n1. Cognitive tracking: One cannot act from a de dicto desire without engaging the right-making features.  The alleged blindness is a mirage.  \n2. Higher-order respect: The motive expresses a second-order readiness to let moral reasons rule, displaying impartial self-governance.  \n3. Reliability: It delivers counterfactual consistency across cases where sentiment may flag.  \n4. Dispositional enrichment: Properly understood, duty-motivation carries a built-in disposition to cultivate those very sensibilities\u2014sympathy, imagination, humility\u2014that critics prize.\n\nWhat makes such action praiseworthy is not an ascetic focus on an empty abstraction but the union of principled governance and concrete responsiveness\u2014a union captured in the Kantian image of a good will.  Those who worry about \u201cmoral fetishism\u201d are right to prize engagement with others\u2019 welfare, but wrong to think that dutiful agency cannot deliver it.  The fetishist spectre evaporates once we see that the desire to do what is right, if sincere and reflective, is already the desire to let the concrete moral facts speak with full authority in one\u2019s practical life.", "output_tokens": 3708, "reasoning_tokens": 640}

Setting the Stage  \n\nSuppose a nurse named Jordan dislikes her patient\u2014a verbally abusive man who reminds her of a childhood bully. When the man presses the call button, Jordan\u2019s spontaneous feelings incline her to delay. Instead she tells herself, \u201cHe has a right to adequate care; that makes it morally required,\u201d and she administers the pain medication at once. Nothing else figures in her conscious motivation\u2014no surge of sympathy, no warm concern for the patient\u2019s welfare. Was Jordan\u2019s act morally worthy, or merely correct?  \n\nCritics of \u201cmoral fetishism\u201d say Jordan\u2019s motivation is defective. She cares, they say, about the property of being-right rather than about the concrete value that makes relieving pain worth doing. On this view moral worth requires the agent to be moved by those very considerations\u2014here, the patient\u2019s suffering\u2014not by an abstract concern for morality.  \n\nI will argue that the critics are mistaken. Acting solely from a de dicto desire to do what is morally right can, under the right internal architecture, suffice for full moral worth. What makes such action praiseworthy is that the de dicto desire manifests the agent\u2019s practical identity as a self-legislating moral subject: it is a second-order commitment that reliably regulates first-order conduct by responding to the balance of moral reasons, while remaining poised to incorporate those reasons more concretely when circumstances permit. The objection of fetishism stems from conflating (a) what the agent explicitly attends to during deliberation with (b) what her governing commitment represents and tracks. Once we keep these apart, the worry dissolves.  \n\nThe argument proceeds as follows. Section 2 clarifies the distinction between de dicto and de re moral motivation and situates the debate. Section 3 outlines three reasons to regard pure dutiful motivation as sufficient for moral worth: reliability, reflexive self-governance, and developmental plasticity. Section 4 answers four leading objections\u2014fetishism, alienation, motivational fragility, and moral misunderstanding. Section 5 states a set of conditions under which duty-only action is praiseworthy, illustrated by new examples. Section 6 briefly situates the view within Kantian and contemporary virtue-ethical landscapes and concludes.\n\n2. De dicto versus De re Moral Motivation  \n\nA de re desire for \u03c6 is aimed at \u03c6 under a particular description expressive of the value that makes \u03c6 worth pursuing: \u201crelieve this person\u2019s suffering.\u201d A de dicto desire to do what is right is aimed at whatever action falls under the description \u201cmorally required,\u201d whatever its specific content. When this de dicto attitude is the agent\u2019s sole occurrent motive, we have the hard case: she acts because it is right, all things considered, while remaining motivationally silent about the first-order values that ground the rightness.  \n\nSidgwick, Kant, and Ross each give the duty motive a central place, but recent philosophers\u2014Stocker, Railton, Wolf, Smith\u2014suggest it is, at best, an emergency back-up. The nurse who saves you \u201cbecause it is required\u201d rather than \u201cbecause you are in pain\u201d seems chilly, perhaps even disrespectful. The intuitive tug of that reaction fuels the fetishism charge. Yet intuitiveness is not argument; we need to test the reaction against a more precise account of moral worth.\n\n3. Three Grounds for Praiseworthiness  \n\n3.1 Reliability under Moral Uncertainty  \n\nFirst, a purely dutiful motive is often the most reliable regulator of action across fluctuating motivational environments. Empathic concern is sensitive to vividness, proximity, and personal affinities; a de dicto commitment to do what morality requires abstracts from those morally irrelevant variables. That is why we build duties into professional oaths\u2014doctors pledge to treat all patients, not only those they find likable. Reliability is not everything, but it is a core dimension of moral worth: a disposition to act rightly because it is right respects the universality of persons\u2019 claims.  \n\n3.2 Reflexive Self-Governance  \n\nSecond, duty-only motivation exemplifies a distinctive form of rational self-governance. The agent takes up a second-order stance toward her first-order proclivities, endorsing or vetoing them on grounds of rightness. This is not mere heteronomous rule-following; it expresses a practical identity as a law-giver to oneself. When Jordan overrides her irritation and acts from duty, she enacts the same capacity that makes praise, blame, and moral dialogue intelligible. Such reflexivity is itself a value\u2014call it \u201crespect for the authority of reason\u201d\u2014and actions manifesting it possess moral worth even if companion emotions are absent.  \n\n3.3 Developmental Plasticity: The \u201cTraining-Wheels\u201d Model  \n\nThird, a de dicto motive is cognitively portable: it can guide action in unfamiliar circumstances before the agent has acquired the nuanced emotional repertoire that virtue theories prize. Children, moral novices, and even sophisticated adults confronting novel moral terrain can rely on the maxim \u201cDo what is right\u201d as a heuristic that triggers inquiry into what rightness requires here. Seen this way, duty is like training wheels: initially load-bearing, gradually internalized, and never entirely discarded because it continues to steady us when other motives wobble. The capacity to act rightly while purely duty-driven is therefore an important developmental achievement rather than a moral deficiency.\n\n4. Answering Four Objections  \n\n4.1 The Fetishism Charge  \n\nRailton\u2019s original formulation: to care about an action \u201cbecause it is right\u201d is to fetishize a \u201cmysterious moral property\u201d detached from the worldly facts that make rightness right. This misunderstands the representational content of the de dicto attitude. \u201cBecause it is right\u201d is a placeholder for the best available justification. The agent may not rehearse the concrete grounds in consciousness, but her motivational state is still counterfactually dependent on them: if she learned that administering the medication was not, after all, required (say the dosage is contraindicated), her duty motive would cancel. That dependency shows that the so-called fetish tracks precisely the concrete reasons the critic wants highlighted. A fetish that dissolves once the value conferring property disappears is not a fetish.  \n\nAnalogy: A scientist who seeks \u201cthe truth\u201d may not recite every evidential reason at each step, yet her de dicto love of truth is not epistemic fetishism. It is a higher-order regulative ideal that contains an implicit commitment to the concrete considerations constituting truth in each domain.  \n\n4.2 Alienation from Value  \n\nSusan Wolf worries that the dutiful agent is alienated from the goods that give life meaning; she values them \u201cat a distance.\u201d Here the distinction between occurrent focus and dispositional endorsement again matters. The nurse\u2019s attention is on obligation because she needs to override contrary affect. But nothing prevents her from appreciating, during reflective moments, the patient\u2019s intrinsic worth or the value of alleviating pain. Occurrent motivational silence does not imply dispositional indifference. Indeed, agents often compartmentalize focus for functional reasons. A surgeon concentrates on procedural checklists rather than the concrete value of saving life so as to minimize error; she is not thereby alienated from the value of life.  \n\n4.3 Motivational Fragility  \n\nCritics worry that purely dutiful agents will falter once the concept of duty loses salience. Empirical work on \u201cmoral abstraction fatigue\u201d shows some support. Yet a second-order commitment can be motivationally resilient when routinized. Professional norms, military codes, and religious vows exhibit such durability. Moreover, the alternative\u2014relying on shifting sympathetic affects\u2014has its own fragilities. The better response is pluralistic: cultivate both direct concern and duty, letting each shore up the other. The present claim is only that duty alone can suffice, not that it is always preferable.\n\n4.4 Moral Misunderstanding  \n\nA final objection: if rightness is misapprehended, de dicto motivation could lead to wrongdoing excused by ignorance but not praiseworthy action. True, but the same is so for de re sympathy: acting from misplaced compassion (e.g., giving heroin to an addict) is not praiseworthy. The relevant comparison, then, is action that is in fact right and believed right under conditions of normal epistemic responsibility; within that set, dutiful action can possess full worth.\n\n5. Conditions for Dutiful Praiseworthiness  \n\nWe can now articulate more precisely what must obtain for a duty-only action to be morally worthy:\n\nC1. Rightness Awareness: The agent accurately judges that the action is morally required (or permissible and most supported).  \n\nC2. De dicto Motivation: The primary occurrent motive is the desire to do what is right, not fear of sanctions or self-interest.  \n\nC3. Counterfactual Sensitivity: Had the balance of right-making reasons shifted, the agent\u2019s motivation would have changed accordingly.  \n\nC4. Reflective Integration: The duty motive is anchored in the agent\u2019s endorsed practical identity; she sees herself as accountable to moral reasons and would, under reflective equilibrium, affirm the substantive values those reasons embody.  \n\nC5. Competent Execution: The action is performed competently and without negligence; the motive successfully guides implementation.  \n\nWhen these conditions hold, duty-only action deserves the same praise we accord action grounded in direct concern.  \n\nIllustration 1: Impartial Juror. A juror votes to acquit because he believes the prosecution has not met the burden of proof. He feels no particular warmth toward the defendant. His de dicto desire \u201cto do what justice requires\u201d suffices for worth because it manifests respect for the rule of law (C4) and is counterfactually sensitive to the evidence (C3).  \n\nIllustration 2: Triage Physician. Exhausted and emotionally numb, a physician places patients on ventilators according to a utilitarian triage protocol because \u201cit is the fairest system.\u201d Her numbed state precludes vivid compassion, but her duty motive reliably coordinates scarce resources. Meeting C1\u2013C5, her action is clearly laudable.  \n\nIllustration 3: Early-Career Environmental Inspector. Unsure why a small wetland matters ecologically, an inspector nevertheless fines a developer because regulations require protection of such areas. The de dicto motive buys time until she learns the ecosystem science; meanwhile, the wetland survives. The moral worth of the fine rests not on ecological comprehension but on responsible deference to moral authority under uncertainty.\n\n6. Duty and Virtue: Convergence, Not Rivalry  \n\nVirtue ethicists emphasize acting \u201cfor the right reasons in the right way.\u201d Are we, then, conceding that duty-only agents lack full virtue? Not necessarily. The loyalty-of-duty is itself a virtue\u2014call it moral conscientiousness. Aristotle acknowledged that a just person can be motivated by the noble (to kalon) without explicit affective sympathy; what matters is the agent\u2019s stable orientation to the good. Kantian respect and Aristotelian nobility may differ in flavor, but both describe a posture of will directed at the moral point of view. Accordingly, duty-only action may fall short of the richest kind of virtue that harmonizes emotion and reason, yet it need not fall below the threshold of moral worth.  \n\nIndeed, a mature moral psychology typically layers motives: sympathy, solidarity, respect, aesthetic appreciation of the good, and the regulative idea of rightness co-function. The virtue theorist should cheer the presence of conscientious duty because it supports virtuous reliability; the Kantian should welcome sympathetic concern because it eases compliance and enriches human life. The present thesis therefore reconciles, rather than opposes, de dicto duty with concrete value-oriented motivation.\n\n7. Conclusion  \n\nActing solely from a desire to do what is morally right can suffice\u2014sometimes magnificently\u2014for moral worth. The key is to understand the de dicto duty motive not as a fetishistic fixation on an abstract property but as a higher-order commitment that tracks and defers to the very considerations critics champion. When that commitment is epistemically responsible, reflectively integrated, counterfactually sensitive, and effectively executed, the resulting action merits full moral praise.  \n\nJordan the nurse, then, is no moral minimalist. In overriding resentment to honor her patient\u2019s right, she manifests respect for persons, steadiness in the face of partiality, and allegiance to the moral point of view. If later she also cultivates warm concern, so much the better. But she need not wait for such feelings to emerge before her conduct counts as morally worthy. Moral life would be perilous indeed if worth depended on affective states that suffering, fatigue, or mere temperament can withhold. Conscience, in its abstract simplicity, remains enough.", "output_tokens": 3324, "reasoning_tokens": 640}

Introduction and Thesis\n\nA long tradition, from Aristotle through contemporary sentimentalists, holds that morally worthy action must be animated by \u201cthe right sorts\u201d of concrete concerns\u2014love of friends, fellow\u2010feeling, sympathy for the suffering. By contrast, a merely formal desire \u201cto do the morally right thing\u201d seems bloodless. It treats morality like an austere hobby rather than a human practice grounded in the value of persons and their flourishing. I argue, contra this tradition, that a de dicto motive of duty can by itself suffice for moral worth. When an agent\u2019s governing practical commitment is precisely that her conduct answer correctly to the total balance of moral reasons, that commitment can constitute a laudable form of respect for persons and for the shared standpoint of morality. The praiseworthiness of such action lies not in affective warmth but in three interlocking features of the duty\u2010motive: (i) its second\u2010personal recognition of others as holding claims against the agent, (ii) its distinctive form of rational self\u2010government, and (iii) its reliability\u2010enhancing impartiality. Properly understood, none of these features requires concurrent motivation by the concrete right\u2010making considerations themselves. Hence the \u201cmoral fetishism\u201d objection misconstrues both the structure and the value of dutiful agency.\n\n2. Mapping the Target: De Dicto vs. De Re Desires\n\nFollowing Michael Smith, let us distinguish:\n\nA. De re moral desire: wanting, of some particular consideration C (e.g., your friend\u2019s welfare), that C obtain.\n\nB. De dicto moral desire: wanting, of the property right, that one\u2019s action instantiate it\u2014roughly, \u201cto do the right thing, whatever that is.\u201d\n\nCritics grant that both kinds of desire often cooperate in actual psychology. Their complaint is about sufficiency: an agent who would perform the very same right act solely because she believes it is morally required allegedly falls short of full virtue. This agent, we are told, is motivationally mis\u2010attuned: she helps the drowning child out of dutiful obedience rather than out of compassion, and that looks askew.\n\n3. Why \u201cMoral Fetishism\u201d Looks Worrying\n\nThe label \u201cfetishism\u201d (Stocker 1976) suggests three perceived defects.\n\n(a) Content defect: By focusing on the abstract property right rather than on the child\u2019s danger, the agent misses what is valuable.\n\n(b) Emotional defect: Absence of the warm reactive attitudes that normally accompany proper valuing indicates alienation.\n\n(c) Epistemic defect: A purely de dicto disposition is too content\u2010poor; it cannot tell us what is right without independent sensitivity to concrete reasons.\n\nI grant that many duty\u2010motivated agents do exhibit these defects, but I deny that they are inevitable or constitutive of the duty motive. To show this, we need a more nuanced picture of how a de dicto desire can be embedded in the rational psychology of a competent moral agent.\n\n4. The Duty Motive as Second-Personal Recognition\n\nStephen Darwall has argued that morality is fundamentally second\u2010personal: it issues from the authority persons have to address claims to one another. Seen in this light, the abstract desire \u201cto do what is morally required\u201d is not empty formalism but an orientation to those very claims. To govern oneself by the categorical imperative is to acknowledge others\u2019 standing to demand compliance.\n\nConsider the following case.\n\nLifeboat Discipline: You captain an overcrowded lifeboat after a shipwreck. Exhausted, you feel no sympathy left for anyone. Yet you maintain scrupulous order because you judge that morality requires you to respect each survivor\u2019s equal claim to a seat. Your steadfastness keeps panic at bay and saves lives.\n\nWhat motivates you is strictly de dicto: you desire, of whatever conduct is morally required, that you perform it. But this is simultaneously an acknowledgment of each person as a normative equal. The life\u2010saving effect flows precisely from this abstract commitment. Far from fetishistic, your motive is keyed to what is most ethically salient in the situation\u2014the claim each person has not to be shoved overboard for another\u2019s convenience.\n\n5. Rational Self-Government: Autonomy Rather Than Sentiment\n\nKantian traditions stress that moral worth attaches to actions done from duty because they manifest autonomy: the agent acts from a principle she can will as law, rather than from heteronomous inclination. Critics reply that Kantian motives are emotionally impoverished. The deeper issue, however, is not sentiment but self\u2010constitution. When an agent deliberates under the maxim \u201cact only on right\u2010grounded reasons,\u201d she makes herself answerable to reasons as such, thereby exercising the specifically human capacity to guide herself by cognition of the normative. \n\nAutonomy, understood as self\u2010legislation in the space of reasons, is intrinsically valuable. Even if one rescued the drowning child merely because compassion flooded one\u2019s psychology, the act would lack this distinct value of rational self\u2010government. Hence the duty motive can add worth that affective motives, on their own, may not deliver.\n\n6. Reliability and Impartiality\n\nA third virtue of the de dicto motive is its epistemic generality. Concrete sentiments are often parochial: sympathy tracks vividness, proximity, or personal likeness. A standing commitment to \u201cdo what is right\u201d operates through belief rather than feeling and so can correct for these biases. Think of the physician who, late at night, would prefer to go home but stays to treat an anonymous patient because she has formed the resolve never to shirk professional duty. Her impartial resolve secures reliable responsiveness precisely where warm feeling runs out.\n\nThe reliability point rebuts the epistemic\u2010defect charge. A duty motive is not blind; it is guided by the best moral judgment the agent can muster. While that judgment relies on background understanding of concrete values, occurrent motivation need not simultaneously include an affective pull toward each of those values. A scientist need not burn with fascination for every datum she enters; she need only care that her records be accurate. Analogously, a morally conscientious agent needs to care that her acts be right, and the content of \u201cright\u201d will be supplied by her deliberative capacities.\n\n7. Addressing Three Core Objections\n\nObjection 1: The Content Worry\n\n\u201cRight\u201d is too thin to grip the concrete moral landscape. We respond by distinguishing between thin and thick contents of the same desire. The surface content is \u201cto do right,\u201d but its satisfaction conditions include whatever makes actions right in the agent\u2019s evaluative scheme. So the de dicto desire is not semantically vacuous; it functions as a higher\u2010order coordination device linking action to the entire network of right\u2010making features without having to foreground any single one.\n\nObjection 2: The Emotional Worry\n\nSuppose the lifeboat captain feels nothing. Is she missing something important? Yes\u2014sympathy is valuable. But moral worth is multi\u2010dimensional. An act can be worthy along the axis of respect though lacking in warmth. Compare aesthetic distinctness: a minimalist black\u2010and\u2010white photograph can be beautiful without the color saturation of a Monet. It does something different well. Likewise, duty\u2010based worth is not a surrogate for sentimental worth; it is a different good.\n\nObjection 3: The Motivational Sufficiency Worry\n\nIf one wants only to do the right thing, how does one figure out what that is? Practical reasoning supplies content. The de dicto desire sets the normative aim; instrumental reasoning plus background moral knowledge identify the means. There is no lacuna unless we suppose, falsely, that the only way to be sensitive to reasons is to be motivated by them in a first\u2010order, affectional way.\n\n8. The Transparency Condition on Praiseworthy Duty\n\nAlthough a de dicto desire can suffice, it is not automatically praiseworthy. I propose:\n\nTransparency Condition: A duty\u2010motivated action has moral worth only if the agent\u2019s desire to do right is formed and sustained under epistemic responsibility to the underlying reasons.\n\nAn agent who fetishizes the concept \u201cduty\u201d while remaining indifferent to whether her judgment tracks real reasons fails transparency and forfeits worth. But when the agent\u2019s de dicto motive is accompanied by critical vigilance\u2014an openness to evidence, argumentative revision, and empathetic perspective\u2010taking\u2014she meets the condition. The motive\u2019s abstractness then becomes an advantage: it keeps her deliberation answerable to any and all moral considerations that emerge.\n\n9. Two Clarifying Analogies\n\nLegal Integrity Analogy: A judge\u2019s oath is \u201cto uphold the law.\u201d That de dicto commitment suffices for judicial virtue provided the judge interprets the law with care. We do not insist she be moved, in every case, by love for the defendant or outrage at victims\u2019 suffering, though such emotions are welcome. Her worth as a judge lies in fidelity to the normative structure of the legal system.\n\nEpistemic Integrity Analogy: A scientist\u2019s central desire is \u201cto believe what is true.\u201d This abstract aim is laudable and productive; it orients her across disparate domains, from particle physics to ecology. She need not harbor a peculiar affection for quarks; what matters is her steadfastness in proportioning belief to evidence. The moral agent\u2019s de dicto desire plays an analogous role.\n\n10. Reconciling Duty with Concrete Concern\n\nDefenders of sentiment correctly emphasize that in much ordinary life dutiful and affectionate motives intertwine. One may rescue one\u2019s child both out of love and because it is right. My claim is not that de re desire is unnecessary in humanly rich moral life, but only that it is not a necessary condition for moral worth. The landscape is pluralistic: there are multiple independent \u201cvirtue axes.\u201d Compassion, integrity, justice, and respect each ground distinct kinds of praise. An act can score high on one axis while modest on another.\n\n11. Implications for Moral Education\n\nIf the argument succeeds, moral educators should cultivate in students an explicit, principled commitment to do what is right\u2014even when they feel no spontaneous sympathy. Sentimental education is important, but so is the formation of reflectively endorsed maxims that can guide conduct in sympathy\u2019s absence. This dual strategy acknowledges the contingent limits of emotion and the normative centrality of responsible agency.\n\n12. Conclusion\n\nActing solely from the desire to do what is morally right can indeed suffice for morally worthy conduct when the agent\u2019s de dicto commitment embodies (i) second\u2010personal respect, (ii) rational autonomy, and (iii) impartial reliability, and when it satisfies the Transparency Condition of critical responsiveness to real reasons. The widely voiced \u201cfetishism\u201d worry confuses the contents of motivation with its functional role in agency. Far from alienating us from the substantive point of morality, the duty motive integrates us into the shared standpoint from which moral reasons speak. Even if love and sympathy add further hues to the moral portrait, the monochrome of pure duty can itself be a canvas worthy of our praise.", "output_tokens": 2682, "reasoning_tokens": 384}

Opening orientation and thesis\u2028\n\nSuppose I notice that it would be wrong to lie in court, and the only thing that moves me to testify honestly is the abstract thought, \u201cI must do what is morally right.\u201d  Many philosophers\u2014from Butler and Hume through contemporary writers such as Michael Smith, Nomy Arpaly, and Sarah Buss\u2014suspect there is something morally second\u2010rate about my motivation.  It is said to reveal \u201cmoral fetishism,\u201d a cast of mind that treats morality like a porcelain idol rather than as a living concern for people and their interests.  I shall argue that this line of thought is mistaken.  A purely de dicto motive to do what is right can suffice for full moral worth provided (i) the agent\u2019s abstract concern is integrated into a reliable competence to track right-making considerations, and (ii) the concern is anchored in a distinct form of valuing I call recognition-respect.  When those two conditions obtain, dutiful action is not fetishistic but an expression of the agent\u2019s commitment to the equal authority of moral reasons; that commitment itself is a substantive moral value and can ground praiseworthiness.\n\n2. Mapping the dialectic: de dicto versus de re\u2028\n\nLet us mark three useful distinctions.\n\na. Content of the motivating desire.  \n   \u2022 De re: \u201cBecause this keeps my promise to Anne.\u201d  \n   \u2022 De dicto: \u201cBecause it is the morally right thing to do, whatever that turns out to be.\u201d\n\nb. Level of motivation.  \n   \u2022 First-order: directly launches the action.  \n   \u2022 Higher-order: governs which first-order motives are allowed to move one.\n\nc. Mode of valuing.  \n   \u2022 Attachment-based (caring for people, projects).  \n   \u2022 Recognition-respect (acknowledging the authoritative status of another\u2019s claims or of a rule).\n\nStandard critiques assume that praiseworthy motivation must be de re, first-order, and attachment-based.  I deny all three assumptions.  The motive of duty can be higher-order, de dicto, and grounded in recognition-respect, yet morally admirable.\n\n3. Why many philosophers demote the motive of duty\u2028\n\nCriticism usually comes in two versions.\n\nFetishism Argument (Smith).  \nP1  Genuinely moral agents care about what morality is about: the interests, rights, or suffering of others.  \nP2  A merely de dicto desire cares only about the abstract property of \u201crightness.\u201d  \nC   A de dicto-motivated agent fails to care about what matters; her concern is fetishistic.\n\nAlienation Argument (Arpaly).  \nP1  Praiseworthiness requires sensitivity to the right-making features themselves.  \nP2  De dicto motivation is insensitive, because it would move the agent even if those features were absent so long as she believed the act right.  \nC   De dicto motivation alienates the agent from morality\u2019s grounds.\n\nBoth arguments build on an empirical picture: the dutiful agent is thought to be a one-note rule follower whose eyes glaze over the minute actual people arrive.  That is a psychological caricature; more important, it ignores the possibility that abstract duty can be tied non-accidentally to the right-making factors.  To see how, we need a different conception of moral competence and a richer account of the value expressed by respect for duty.\n\n4. Competence, not content, as the locus of moral worth\u2028\n\nBegin with the idea\u2014familiar from virtue epistemology\u2014that what matters is not the surface motive but the competence it manifests.  A good thermometer is not one that \u201cdesires to indicate the right temperature for the right reasons\u201d; it is one that reliably tracks temperature via its proper mechanism.  Analogously, a good moral agent is one whose practical reasoning reliably tracks moral reasons.  Tracking need not occur by desiring welfare or justice on each occasion; it is enough that the agent\u2019s motivational system, when functioning normally, yields actions that are right for the right reasons.\n\nThe de dicto motive of duty can be the regulative centerpiece of such a system.  Consider:\n\nCase 1: The Scrupulous Judge  \nJulia has cultivated a professional habit: whenever she notices a morally relevant situation, she asks, \u201cWhat must I do to respect the rights of the parties before me?\u201d  She consults statutes, precedents, and moral argument, sometimes revising her personal sympathies.  Once she is satisfied which option is morally required, an abstract desire to comply with that requirement supplies the motivational oomph.  She feels no special warmth toward the litigants, yet her judgments consistently reflect their legitimate interests.\n\nJulia\u2019s first-order motive is \u201cdo the right thing,\u201d but it is embedded in a practice of moral deliberation that tracks the concrete right-making facts.  The agent\u2019s competence, not the surface content of her motive, licenses praise.\n\n5. Recognition-respect as a substantive moral value\u2028\n\nWhy, though, is a standing desire to comply with morality praiseworthy at all?  My answer borrows from Stephen Darwall\u2019s notion of recognition-respect.  To respect someone (or a moral requirement) is not primarily to promote their welfare; it is to acknowledge their legitimate authority over one\u2019s will.  That acknowledgment itself is a way of valuing persons: it treats them as beings whose claims are not to be subordinated to contingent preferences.  Acting from the motive of duty just is acting from recognition-respect for the totality of moral claims.  Far from being empty formalism, it affirms the equal standing of everyone affected by one\u2019s action.\n\nThis point undercuts the fetishism charge.  The de dicto property \u201cbeing morally right\u201d is not an occult aura; it is the property of conforming to the set of claims that any person, as such, can press on any other.  Valuing that property is valuing people under the aspect in which they are moral equals.  If I keep my promise to Anne because promises are morally binding, my motive is not uncaring toward Anne; it registers her status as a promisee who holds a legitimate claim over me.\n\n6. Two advantages of duty-first motivation\u2028\n\nEven if de dicto motivation can be respectable, why say it can suffice?  Because in some contexts it outperforms attachment-based motives.\n\nImpartiality.  Attachment is selective; respect for duty is general.  I may feel concern for my friends\u2019 welfare but none for faraway strangers.  A standing desire to do what is right activates impartial principles that shield me from favoritism.\n\nStability under moral uncertainty.  Empirical evidence shows that sympathy is fickle; it dissipates under cognitive load or group pressure.  The abstract commitment to morality can motivate in precisely those hard cases\u2014Whistleblower Moments\u2014where emotional concern is weakest.  The sufficiency claim is not that duty is always better, merely that in the range of ordinary cases it can provide adequate, sometimes superior, grounds for praise.\n\n7. Reply to Objection 1: The Misanthrope revisited\u2028\n\nKant\u2019s famous \u201cmisanthrope\u201d performs beneficent acts solely from reverence for the moral law.  Critics say this is a cold excellence at best.  Yet moral worth, unlike full virtue, is assessed relative to the strengths a person actually possesses.  What makes the misanthrope praiseworthy is that he overcomes his antipathy by subjecting it to the equal authority of others\u2019 claims.  The action manifests self-legislation of a kind central to moral agency.  Would it be better were he also moved by sympathy?  Certainly.  But the absence of a further good does not negate the worth of the good already present.\n\n8. Reply to Objection 2: Moral deference and epistemic surrogacy\u2028\n\nAnother worry: if the motive of duty suffices, moral deference to experts might be equally praiseworthy; yet many writers (Hills, Enoch) insist that purely deferential morality is defective.  The worry rests on conflating motivational and epistemic roles.  A competent agent may rely on experts for information so long as she would retract her reliance upon learning that the right-making reasons do not support the advice.  Deference that obliterates independent responsiveness would indeed be unworthy, because it fails the competence condition.  But principled deference guided by the aim \u201cdo what morality requires\u201d can be entirely respectable\u2014just as deferring to translators is compatible with valuing the meaning of foreign texts.\n\n9. The hierarchical model: duty as higher-order governance\u2028\n\nWe can now articulate a positive account:\n\nHierarchical Competence Model  \nLevel 1: First-order inclinations\u2014sympathy, aversion, prudence.  \nLevel 2: Higher-order commitment\u2014desire that one\u2019s first-order inclinations conform to moral requirements.  \nMechanism: The agent monitors proposed actions; if she judges them wrong, the higher-order commitment vetoes them and supplies sufficient motivation to do otherwise.\n\nMoral worth attaches when an action issues from the proper functioning of that mechanism in tracking right-making reasons.  Whether the motivational spark at Level 1 is attachment or respect makes no difference so long as the higher-order commitment ensures responsiveness to moral reasons.  Therefore acting \u201csolely\u201d from the desire to do what is right\u2014meaning that, at the decisive moment, only the higher-order motive supplies motivation\u2014can suffice for praise.\n\n10. A concrete illustration: emergency triage\u2028\n\nImagine a battlefield medic confronted with three wounded soldiers.  She must allocate scarce plasma quickly.  Exhausted, she cannot summon individualized concern; what props her upright is the thought, \u201cThis protocol is what fairness requires.\u201d  She follows the impartial triage algorithm.  Her action perfectly tracks the relevant moral considerations\u2014urgency, prognosis, fairness\u2014despite being propelled by an abstract desire to comply with duty.  To call this \u201cfetishism\u201d is tone-deaf to moral reality; her respect for the soldiers as equal claimants is precisely what the situation morally demands.\n\n11. Relation to alternative accounts\u2028\n\nMy view shares ground with Markovits\u2019s \u201cMoral Reason\u2010Centred Account\u201d but departs in two ways.  First, Markovits holds that motivation must take the form \u201cbecause it is morally right,\u201d but she is neutral about whether the agent must competently track right-making facts.  I make competence a non-negotiable condition.  Second, I emphasize recognition-respect as the value expressed, thereby explaining why the abstract motive matters independently of outcome reliability.\n\nThe proposal also speaks to Arpaly\u2019s praise of \u201cinadvertent virtue.\u201d  Arpaly correctly observes that agents moved by, say, spontaneous compassion can outshine dutiful agents when the latter misjudge.  The hierarchical model agrees: when the competence requirement is unsatisfied (because the agent\u2019s moral beliefs are off track), duty motivation fails to ground moral worth.  The point is conditional: when the beliefs are true and the mechanism works, duty suffices.\n\n12. Potential empirical support\u2028\n\nRecent moral psychology provides indirect corroboration.  Studies on \u201cidentity-based motivation\u201d (Aquino & Reed) show that seeing oneself as a \u201cmoral person\u201d predicts resilient ethical action under pressure, controlling for empathic concern.  In these cases the self-conception functions de dicto\u2014it refers to being \u201ca moral person\u201d rather than to caring about any particular good.  Yet it stably generates right action.  The data suggest that abstract duty motives can indeed power morally commendable behavior.\n\n13. Limits and residual hybridity\u2028\n\nI have not claimed that duty is the sole or even the best motive.  Human moral excellence is richer when sympathy, friendship, and love co-operate with duty.  My thesis is the sufficiency thesis: in the presence of competence and recognition-respect, no further motive is needed for an action\u2019s moral worth.  That leaves room for hybrid views on which mixed motivations have incremental value.  Admitting sufficiency does not entail exclusivity.\n\n14. Closing synthesis\u2028\n\nActing from the motive of duty stands accused of fetishism and alienation.  The accusation looks plausible only if we equate moral worth with emotional warmth or with first-order attraction to benefits.  A deeper picture of agency locates moral worth in the exercise of a reliable capacity to heed moral reasons, and it recognizes that respect for the moral law is itself a way of valuing persons\u2014namely, as equal authors of the normative order.  When an agent\u2019s de dicto commitment is integrated into such competence, her dutiful actions deserve our praise.  Morality is not a fetish but a public practice of reciprocal authority.  To act solely from duty is to honor that practice and, in doing so, to honor everyone subject to it.", "output_tokens": 3363, "reasoning_tokens": 640}

Introduction and Thesis  \n\nEpistemic basing is the relation that must obtain between a subject\u2019s reason and her doxastic attitude if the attitude is to inherit the reason\u2019s justificatory force.  Some philosophers\u2014call them \u201cTransparencists\u201d\u2014contend that basing requires occurrent, first-person consciousness of the relevant reason.  No luminous awareness, no genuine basing, hence no epistemic status.  If Transparencism is correct, the deliverances of modular, automatic, or otherwise subconscious cognitive systems\u2014perceptual object recognition, grammatical parsing, heuristic judgment\u2014would be epistemically blind: we would \u201csee\u201d or \u201cjust believe,\u201d but never believe *for* a reason.\n\nI will argue that Transparencism is false.  Conscious awareness of one\u2019s reasons is neither necessary nor sufficient for epistemic basing.  What is necessary is that (i) the subject\u2019s cognitive system be causally sensitive to factive or evidential states that would constitute good reasons if represented at the personal level, and (ii) the subject possess a *standing capacity* to upgrade those subpersonal representations into conscious, personal-level reasons through reflection or query.  Call this the Hybrid Capacity Account (HCA).  \n\nHCA allows genuinely epistemic basing in modular, automatic cognition while preserving the deontic intuitions that motivate awareness requirements: the agent remains answerable, because she *could*, with minimal reflection, surface the operative reasons.  I defend HCA in four steps:  \n\n(1) Clarify the notions of \u201creason,\u201d \u201cawareness,\u201d and \u201cbasing\u201d at stake.  \n(2) Present empirical and phenomenological cases where justification seems present despite absent awareness.  \n(3) Diagnose why the Transparencist intuition nevertheless tempts us, and show why it overstates what responsibility requires.  \n(4) Offer a positive account of basing that vindicates subpersonal reasons yet leaves room for epistemic evaluation of agents qua agents.\n\n2. Preliminaries: Disentangling Three Conflations  \n\nConflation 1: Evidence vs. Reason.  A *reason* is an informational state that *figures in* the etiology or sustaining of a mental attitude in a way that, in a good case, makes that attitude epistemically appropriate.  It need not itself be consciously tokened; it need only stand in the right kind of causal-explanatory and normative relation.  \n\nConflation 2: Awareness vs. Access.  \u201cBeing aware of R\u201d may mean (a) currently attending to R, (b) having a higher-order representation of R, or (c) being able to bring R to consciousness upon reflective demand.  Transparencists typically oscillate between (a) and (b), but justificatory practice in science and everyday life tracks (c).  We often defend a belief by *recovering* reasons we were not attending to when the belief formed.  \n\nConflation 3: Personal vs. Subpersonal Levels.  Reasons are often discussed as personal-level states (beliefs, experiences).  Yet cognitive science teaches that personal-level attitudes depend on layered subpersonal machinery.  If a subpersonal representation carries individuating content that would count as a reason were it \u201cpromoted\u201d to the personal level, why deny that it can confer justification in situ?\n\n3. Cases of Unconscious Yet Apparently Justified Belief  \n\na. Perceptual Discrimination.  Expert radiologists spot a microcalcification \u201cat a glance.\u201d  Asked why, they may initially shrug: \u201cIt just popped out.\u201d  Subsequent verbalization reveals implicit sensitivity to textural and contrast cues.  The belief was *because of* those cues even before the expert articulated them.\n\nb. Implicit Statistical Reasoning.  Children learning a language respect subtle probabilistic constraints (e.g., auxiliary inversion) long before they can formulate grammatical rules.  Their acceptances of well-formed sentences are justified by environmental frequencies, not by articulable syntax trees.\n\nc. Blindsight Type-2.  Some blindsight subjects report \u201ca mere guess\u201d about arrow direction yet reliably succeed at better-than-chance rates.  When the visual subsystem guides the forced-choice response, the guess is epistemically based on visual information the subject is not aware of.\n\nd. Everyday Memory.  I recall that the meeting is at 3 p.m. without recalling the calendar entry that encoded it.  On reflection I can track the source, but the memory\u2019s justification did not await that act.\n\nAll these judgments are answerable to reasons\u2014visual, statistical, memorial\u2014without occurrent awareness of them.  To deny their justificatory status would render much of human (and animal) cognition non-epistemic, a reductio of Transparencism.\n\n4. Why the Transparency Intuition Feels Compelling  \n\nTwo motivations animate Transparencism:\n\nDeontic Motivation.  Justification is a normative status; one ought not believe arbitrarily.  If reasons are unconscious, how can the believer be *responsible*?  Responsibility seems to require *recognizability* of one\u2019s reasons.\n\nPhenomenological Motivation.  When prompted \u201cWhy do you think p?\u201d, successful defenders typically *become* conscious of reasons.  This post-hoc correlation seduces us into thinking the awareness was already there.\n\nBoth motivations confuse the *possibility* of conscious access with its *actuality*.  Responsibility demands that the agent could, given normal functioning, surface her reasons\u2014 not that she already has.  Analogously, moral responsibility requires the capacity to notice wrongdoing, not constant occurrent recognition of moral rules.\n\n5. The Hybrid Capacity Account  \n\nHCA:  \nA belief B held by subject S at t is epistemically justified iff  \n(i) There exists a factive or evidential state R within S\u2019s cognitive system such that R causally sustains B in a way that is modally stable (were R absent, B would not be held);  \n(ii) S possesses at t the cognitive capacity to render R available to conscious reflection with minimal non-epistemically-driven effort (e.g., by attending, recalling, or being asked \u201cwhy?\u201d).\n\nClause (i) secures the *objective* link between truth-conducive information and the doxastic attitude.  Clause (ii) secures *subjective* answerability.  Together they vindicate familiar internalist intuitions without incarcerating justification inside the phenomenology of the moment.\n\n6. Objections and Replies  \n\nObjection 1: The Access Internalist.  \u201cCapacity\u201d is too cheap; even the dog has a latent capacity it cannot exercise.  Reply: capacity is indexed to the agent\u2019s actual cognitive architecture and situational constraints.  A normal adult can rehearse perceptual evidence upon request; a thermostat cannot.  The capacity must be reliable, contextually manifestable, and integrated with deliberative faculties.\n\nObjection 2: The Credit Theorist.  Epistemic credit belongs only to performances issuing from *reflective* agency.  Automatic basing deprives the subject of intellectual virtue.  Reply: virtues are stable dispositions to achieve epistemic goods; they need not execute through conscious control at every tokening.  An archer\u2019s unreflective muscle memory is creditable precisely because it is the culminating fruit of her trained agency.  Likewise, the radiologist\u2019s split-second perception expresses cultivated perceptual virtues.\n\nObjection 3: The Transparency of Reasons Principle (TP): To believe for a reason is to regard that reason as supporting the belief.  Since regarding is conscious, basing demands consciousness.  Reply: TP confuses *manifest endorsement* with *functional endorsement*.  A subsystem can \u201ctreat\u201d R as a reason in computations that respect R\u2019s evidential weight without the whole subject regarding anything.  Functional endorsement is enough for epistemic grounding; personal-level endorsement is needed only for higher-order evaluation.\n\nObjection 4: The No-Defeater Problem.  If reasons are unconscious, how can the subject monitor defeaters?  Reply: defeater-detection is itself often automatic (e.g., noticing conflicting visual cues).  When it fails, subjects are criticizable\u2014but so are conscious reasoners who overlook defeaters despite awareness.  The relevant norm is vigilance, not omniscience.\n\n7. Distinguishing Operative from Registering Reasons  \n\nA contribution of HCA is the operative/registering distinction:\n\nOperative Reason: any representational state that functionally bears the counterfactual weight in producing or sustaining a belief.  \n\nRegistering Reason: an operative reason that the subject is currently conscious of.  \n\nBasing requires the presence of an operative reason; reflective justification demands the potential transformation of operatives into registering reasons.  The distinction reframes debates about \u201cinternalism\u201d: what must be \u201cinside\u201d is not the phenomenology, but the *operativity* plus the capacity for registration.\n\n8. The Diachronic Dimension  \n\nJustification is often assessed synchronically: do you *now* have good reasons?  Yet deliberative practices are diachronic.  We form beliefs automatically, notice later whether each is suspect, and either sustain, suspend, or revise.  HCA fits this temporality.  A belief may be justified at t\u2081 because of subpersonal operatives; at t\u2082, after defeater evidence emerges, the same belief becomes unjustified if the agent negligently fails to consult or integrate that evidence.  The capacity condition enforces ongoing epistemic responsibility.\n\n9. Empirical Plausibility and Philosophical Payoff  \n\nCognitive science increasingly models consciousness as a capacity-limited broadcast system layered atop specialist modules.  If epistemic justification required the scarce resource of consciousness, rational life would grind to a halt.  We would need to attend to every micro-cue underwriting each perceptual judgment.  HCA aligns epistemic normativity with realistic cognitive economics: let automatic systems do first-pass filtering; invoke consciousness for problem-cases or explanation-contexts.\n\nPhilosophically, HCA dissolves a false dichotomy between externalist reliabilism (which threatens to de-personalize justification) and internalist accessibilism (which threatens to over-intellectualize it).  The capacity requirement is internalist enough to ground deontic appraisal; the operative-reason requirement is externalist enough to secure truth-connection.\n\n10. Comparison with Rival Theories  \n\n10.1 Pure Causal Theories (Alston, Goldman 1979).  These drop any access condition.  Worries: zombie-believers could be justified; criticizability evaporates.  HCA retains causal sensitivity but repairs accountability.\n\n10.2 Phenomenal Conception (Conee & Feldman 2001).  Evidence is what is \u201cbefore the mind.\u201d  Strains credulity about perceptual expertise, memory retrieval, and infant cognition.  HCA respects these data.\n\n10.3 Higher-Order Thought Accounts (Smithies 2019).  Justification equals the availability of non-inferential awareness.  Closer to HCA but still ties availability too tightly to present phenomenology; fails cases where awareness would require re-consulting the environment (e.g., reading the calendar again).  HCA\u2019s capacity clause is broader.\n\n11. Two Anticipated Advancements  \n\nFirst, the operative/registering distinction may illuminate epistemic defeat: defeaters are threats that disable the capacity to register original reasons as justificatory, not necessarily threats that erase the operatives.  \n\nSecond, HCA suggests a research program in cognitive epistemology: map which subpersonal formats can constitute operatives for personal-level justification.  Doing so could refine normative models of machine learning explanations and AI transparency.\n\n12. Conclusion  \n\nLack of conscious awareness at the time of belief formation does not preclude a mental state from being epistemically based on reasons.  What matters is that the belief be produced and sustained by cognitive processes responsive to evidential states\u2014operative reasons\u2014and that the agent retain the *capacity* to surface those reasons when reflection, challenge, or error-correction demands.  Transparencism mistakes a useful epistemic *option* (the ability to articulate reasons) for a standing *requirement*, and thereby underestimates the epistemic potency of our automatic, modular minds.\n\nThe Hybrid Capacity Account preserves epistemic responsibility while accommodating the empirical realities of cognition.  It invites us to reconceive justification not as a spotlight shone continuously on reasons, but as stewardship: the agent must keep her cognitive house in order, ready to illuminate reasons when needed, even if they ordinarily work in the semi-darkness of the mind.", "output_tokens": 3149, "reasoning_tokens": 448}

I will argue that it does not. Occurrent consciousness is neither necessary nor sufficient for epistemic basing. What matters is that (i) the subject\u2019s cognitive system token the right sorts of representations in the right explanatory role and (ii) those representations be available\u2014though not necessarily already accessed\u2014for rational scrutiny and control at the personal level. I call this view the \u201ctranslucent basing\u201d model. It rejects the crude equation \u201cunconscious = merely causal,\u201d yet preserves the thought that reasons must, in principle, be \u2018transparent\u2019 to the agent\u2019s rational agency. Roughly, epistemic basing is translucent rather than fully transparent. \n\nThe argument proceeds as follows. Section 1 clarifies key notions: motivating versus normative reasons, occurrent versus standing awareness, and the basing relation. Section 2 reconstructs three prominent arguments for the Awareness Requirement (AR) and shows why each is incomplete. Section 3 develops the translucent basing model, drawing on empirical work on perception, implicit statistical learning, and ordinary expertise. Section 4 addresses four objections. Section 5 sketches some wider implications for theories of epistemic responsibility and the ethics of belief. Section 6 concludes.\n\n1. Clarifying the terrain\n\n1.1 Motivating and normative reasons  \nA normative reason is a fact that counts in favor of believing p. A motivating reason is the consideration in light of which the subject actually believes p. Basing theories typically require that the belief be motivated by the reason (not merely supported by it). Our question concerns motivating reasons: can they operate when the subject is unaware of them?\n\n1.2 Occurrent awareness, standing awareness, and accessibility  \n\u201cI am aware of R\u201d can mean: (a) I am currently attending to R; (b) I can, without gathering new evidence, retrieve R by reflection; or (c) R is stored in some sub-personal module that I could not, even on reflection, articulate. The Awareness Requirement, interpreted strongly, insists on (a); moderate versions allow (b); externalist competitors permit even (c).\n\n1.3 The basing relation  \nVirtually everyone agrees that a mere causal connection is insufficient; deviant causal chains\u2014taking a pill that causes the belief via hallucination\u2014do not confer justification. But conscious \u201ctaking-as-a-reason\u201d might be too demanding. We need an account that is stronger than naked causation yet weaker than phenomenological endorsement.\n\n2. Why think awareness is required?\n\n2.1 The agency argument  \nBecause believing is something for which we are answerable, epistemic basing must be under our rational control; and rational control, the argument goes, presupposes conscious access. Donald Davidson and John McDowell hint at this: we can be held to the reasons we can give.  \n\nReply. Holding responsible need not rely on simultaneous consciousness. Consider driving home: I obey traffic signals without consciously representing traffic rules. If challenged, I can articulate them. The accountability condition is thus dispositional, not occurrent. \n\n2.2 The phenomenological guidance argument  \nMany report a phenomenology of \u201cseeing that p because q.\u201d Without it, the worry is that the process is blind.  \n\nReply. The inference perception analogy shows the flaw: visual shape constancy relies on unconscious calculations of retinal cues. We would not deny that those cues are reasons for the perceptual judgment. Phenomenology, at best, is evidence for but not constitutive of basing.\n\n2.3 The normativity-tracking argument  \nTo be justified, one must be in a position to appreciate that one\u2019s reasons are good. Otherwise, differences between the cognitively virtuous and the accidentally correct collapse.  \n\nReply. The criticism overgeneralizes. Sub-personal mechanisms can track normativity by embodying proper functions or reliability. A chess engine \u201cappreciates\u201d positional advantages sub-personally; the grandmaster may not consciously rehearse evaluation functions but still bases her move on them. Personal-level appreciation is not required for epistemic standing, only for a certain kind of reflective ideal.\n\nNone of the above arguments show that occurrent awareness is indispensable. They motivate the milder claim that some accessibility to reasons is essential. The translucent model honors that.\n\n3. The translucent basing model\n\n3.1 Core idea  \nA mental state M is epistemically based on reason-representation R iff:  \n(i) R figures in the causal etiology of M via a process that is of the right sub-type (non-deviant, truth-oriented);  \n(ii) The cognitive architecture affords the subject counterfactual control: if R were recognized to be defeated, the subject would be disposed, through the same architecture, to revise M;  \n(iii) R is, upon normal reflection, at least partly articulable by the subject.  \n\nClause (i) blocks deviant causation; (ii) ensures normative sensitivity; (iii) \u2013 the translucence clause \u2013 preserves the link to rational agency while allowing that at the time of belief formation R can be unconscious.\n\n3.2 Empirical grounding  \na. Perceptual constancies. Helmholtz\u2019s \u201cunconscious inferences\u201d involve cue integration\u2014e.g., inferring size from retinal size, distance, and context. People normally cannot cite the specific cues, yet when those cues are manipulated (Ames room), judgments shift predictably. The system\u2019s disposition to update satisfies (ii), and basic verbal reports such as \u201cit looks larger because it\u2019s closer\u201d satisfy minimal (iii).  \n\nb. Implicit statistical learning. Ordinary language users can judge that a sentence is grammatical after exposure to an artificial grammar. If probed, they articulate high-level regularities (\u201cno word repeats\u201d); they are mistaken about the specific cues but are not utterly in the dark. Translucence: partial, defeasible articulation.  \n\nc. Expert perception. The seasoned radiologist spots a tumor \u201cat a glance.\u201d Subsequent questioning elicits features\u2014irregular border, asymmetric shading\u2014though the noticing was immediate. The expertise module provides R, but reflective unpacking provides (iii).\n\n3.3 Why translucence is sufficient  \nThe justificatory locus is the reliable, truth-aimed structure (i). Its outputs are under the subject\u2019s rational jurisdiction because defeating considerations can percolate through the same system (ii). And when social or reflective demands arise, the subject can render at least coarse-grained R-statements (iii). Conscious awareness at t1 is thus dispensable.\n\n4. Four objections answered\n\n4.1 The purely causal worry  \nObjection: your view collapses basing into reliable causation; normativity drops out.  \nReply: clause (ii) imports sensitivity to defeating reasons, ruling out pathways that are merely reliable yet cognitively impenetrable (e.g., clairvoyance \u00e0 la BonJour). The process must be such that when presented with rebutting evidence, the same mechanism would revise. That is a normatively loaded counterfactual, not sheer causation.\n\n4.2 The opacity worry  \nObjection: many sub-personal computations (Bayesian updates, deep-learning heuristics) are so intractable that condition (iii) fails. Then most of our beliefs lack justification.  \nReply: The translucence threshold is deliberately low\u2014\u201cpartly articulable.\u201d You need not cite the exact likelihood ratio; indicating the salient data point suffices. Even intractable modules output usable cues (\u201cBecause the prior image shows rapid growth\u201d). Where articulation collapses entirely, justification may indeed be limited; that is a virtue, not a vice, of the account.\n\n4.3 The bad defeat case  \nSuppose I unconsciously rely on racial bias in hiring but sincerely cite merit-based reasons when reflecting. According to translucent basing, am I justified?  \nReply: No, because (i) fails\u2014the actual explanatory route includes a structurally defective process (racial bias is not epistemically truth-aimed). Moreover, (ii) fails: discovering the bias would not automatically trigger revision, as the mechanism itself is the culprit. The model diagnoses the deficit without appealing to occurrent awareness.\n\n4.4 The regress worry  \nMust the reflective articulation itself be based on reasons, leading to infinite regress? No. Clause (iii) demands only the capacity to articulate; exercising it terminates the chain in occurrent consciousness, satisfying AR-intuitions. The regress stops when the subject consciously endorses a terminal premise treated as prima facie given (percept, memory, or self-evident proposition).\n\n5. Consequences for epistemic responsibility\n\n5.1 Two tiers of justification  \nThe model supports a dual notion: basal justification (stemming from translucent basing) and reflective justification (requiring occurrent awareness). We often hold novices to the latter in pedagogical contexts, but basal justification is adequate for everyday cognitive life.\n\n5.2 Gradable responsibility  \nBecause defeat-sensitivity comes in degrees, so does responsibility. A subject with limited cognitive control\u2014infants, certain non-human animals\u2014can satisfy (i) and (ii) weakly, granting them proto-justification without full reflective agency.\n\n5.3 The ethics of belief  \nPragmatist traditions urge that we \u201cmind our reasons.\u201d On my view, the normative pressure is to maintain architectures that keep reasons translucent: to cultivate habits of reflection, to debug biases, to improve articulability. This yields substantive guidance\u2014distinct from both strict evidentialism and laissez-faire reliabilism.\n\n6. Conclusion\n\nOccurrent consciousness is not the litmus test of epistemic basing. Sub-personal, modular, and automatic processes can ground justified belief provided that they embody truth-conducive reasoning, remain defeasible by contrary considerations, and allow, at least in principle, some reflective articulation. The translucent basing model preserves the internalist intuition that reasons must be answerable to the agent while acknowledging the cognitive-scientific reality that much of our best reasoning is fast, frugal, and unconscious. Far from undermining epistemic normativity, recognizing the legitimacy of unconscious basing refines our understanding of what it is to be a rational believer in an evolved, information-saturated mind.", "output_tokens": 2831, "reasoning_tokens": 704}

Introduction and Thesis\n\nIs consciousness a necessary ingredient of epistemic basing? A venerable strand of internalism says Yes: unless the subject can, at least in principle, bring to consciousness the considerations that make her belief rational, the belief is not properly based on reasons and therefore lacks the standing needed for justification. But this claim sits uneasily with a rapidly growing body of cognitive-scientific work on automatic yet reliably truth-conducive processes\u2014perceptual inferences, statistical pattern extraction, and the like\u2014that routinely generate beliefs outside the subject\u2019s conscious view. My thesis is that conscious awareness of one\u2019s reasons is not necessary for epistemic basing, though it can enhance the kind of justification enjoyed. Proper basing requires (i) the right subpersonal explanatory connection between reasons and belief, and (ii) the availability of those reasons to consciousness under suitable reflection. Conscious access at the moment of belief-formation is optional; what matters is what I call diachronic availability: the reasons reside in cognitive structures that can, if prompted, be surfaced to guide further reasoning. \n\nThe argument proceeds in five steps. (1) I distinguish three conceptions of the basing relation and show that only one bears the internalist burden. (2) I build a positive account on which automatic modules can furnish genuine epistemic reasons. (3) I introduce diachronic availability and explain how it underwrites epistemic responsibility. (4) I defend the view against four powerful objections, showing that each either misconstrues basing or misidentifies the locus of responsibility. (5) I conclude by sketching some implications for epistemic evaluation in cognitive science and moral psychology.\n\n2. Three Conceptions of Basing\n\nTo see what is at stake, we need conceptual clarity. We can distinguish:\n\nA. Etiological basing: a belief B is based on reason R when R causally contributes in the right way to the formation or maintenance of B. This is a purely psychological relation.\n\nB. Deliberative basing: B is based on R when the subject consciously takes R as her reason\u2014roughly, when R figures in her deliberation.\n\nC. Normative basing: B is based on R when R makes B epistemically permissible or justified.\n\nInternalists often collapse B and C: only deliberatively based beliefs can be normatively based, because only conscious endorsement puts the agent in a position to take epistemic responsibility. Externalists focus on A: if the causal chain is epistemically reliable, that suffices for justification regardless of the subject\u2019s point of view.\n\nBoth collapses are too quick. Etiological basing without further constraints leads to deviant causal chains: the fact that the barometer drops can cause me to believe there will be a storm via sheer superstition, yet the barometer reading is not my reason. Conversely, deliberative basing is unnecessarily stringent: toddlers justifiably believe that the toy is behind the sofa though they cannot articulate their perceptual grounds. What we need is an account combining A\u2019s sensitivity to actual psychology with B\u2019s link to agency, all in service of C\u2019s normative goal.\n\n3. Subpersonal Reasons and Automatic Inference\n\nCognitive science now offers a rich picture of domain-specific systems that transform incoming data into representations poised for belief fixation. Consider chess grandmasters who \u201csee\u201d that a knight fork is possible after milliseconds of board exposure. Or professional chicken-sexers who reliably classify chicks\u2019 sexes without knowing how they do it. In these cases the subject lacks conscious access to the micro-patterns noticed; nevertheless the beliefs formed are counterfactually sensitive to those patterns and track truth remarkably well. Such processes instantiate what Susanna Siegel calls \u201cepistemically upgrading perception\u201d: the output inherits justificatory force from the accuracy of the subpersonal inference linking stimulus to representation.\n\nTo capture that force we need not posit explicit premises in the agent\u2019s working memory. Instead, we can treat the informational states operative in the module\u2014edge detec\u00adtions, statistical cues, or stored exemplars\u2014as subpersonal reasons. They are reasons in virtue of two features: (a) they stand in contentful relations to the belief (they represent the chick\u2019s tail-feather spacing), and (b) they figure in the counterfactual causal network that would dispose the subject to revise the belief were the cues different (if the spacing differed, the classifier would switch verdicts). Put differently, the module implements a tacit inference schema whose premises, though not consciously accessed, are bona fide epistemic grounds.\n\n4. Diachronic Availability and Epistemic Responsibility\n\nInternalists object: even if subpersonal states have content, the agent cannot cite them; thus she cannot take responsibility for the belief, and epistemic status cannot be conferred. Here is where diachronic availability enters. A reason is diachronically available when, upon suitable prompting\u2014extended reflection, training, or third-person feedback\u2014the agent can bring to consciousness a representation sufficiently similar in content to the subpersonal ground and can allow that representation to regulate further belief revision. Notice that availability is a modal condition: it need not be realized at t1, the moment of belief-formation; what matters is that the cognitive architecture connects the subpersonal reason to conscious, personal-level reasoning channels.\n\nWhy is this enough for responsibility? Because epistemic responsibility is a dispositional notion. I am blameworthy for prejudice if, when presented with contrary evidence, I remain unmoved; I am praiseworthy for a belief if I would retract it upon learning of defeaters. Diachronic availability ensures that the subject is in principle open to such rational pressure. The chicken-sexer can attend to exemplary chicks, retrain, and improve; the grandmaster can explain her lines retrospectively; the toddler will learn to verbalize her perceptual grounds as linguistic competence grows. No sceptical barrier prevents these agents from integrating the reasons into conscious deliberation over time.\n\nDiachronic availability therefore reconciles etiological basing with normative assessment: the same subpersonal link that produced the belief also sustains the counterfactual that, under reflection, the agent would form, endorse, or revise the belief for (roughly) the same reason. The upshot is a two-tier picture: instant justification arises from well-functioning modules supplying epistemic grounds, while reflective justification accrues when the agent endorses or revises the belief upon later scrutiny. Absence of initial awareness does not block the first layer, though it may limit the second.\n\n5. Objections and Replies\n\nObjection 1: The Transparency Argument. A core datum of first-personal phenomenology is that when one asks \u201cWhy do I believe p?\u201d the answer is usually transparent: I see that p, I remember that p, or I infer that p from q. Without such transparency, the belief seems arbitrary; hence lack of awareness undermines justification.\n\nReply. Transparency is indeed a mark of deliberative basing, but its absence is diagnostic only when it indicates no diachronically available grounds. When I glance at a red surface and believe \u201cthe cup is red,\u201d I cannot cite low-level computations of L-cone activation. Yet the belief is anything but arbitrary: the visual system has delivered the relevant information. The seeming arbitrariness stems from introspective omission, not from epistemic vacuum. Once we learn about color vision, we appreciate that ample grounds exist subpersonally, preserved for future conscious endorsement if needed. \n\nObjection 2: The New Evil Demon. Suppose an envatted counterpart shares your internal states but lacks any environmental link. Both of you lack conscious awareness of your low-level reasons. On my account, the envatted subject\u2019s beliefs would also be justified, which seems absurd because her beliefs are massively false.\n\nReply. The intuition conflates truth with justification. Even independent of my proposal, many epistemologists accept that internal duplicates share justification versions of their beliefs, demon or not. My view is compatible with that verdict: the subpersonal information is equally present in both agents, so prima facie justification is equal. If one rejects such internalist parity, diachronic availability can still draw a distinction: the non-demon subject\u2019s subpersonal states correlate with external feedback, allowing eventual conscious corroboration, whereas the demon\u2019s do not. The latter therefore lacks full reflective justification and is epistemically worse off: once prompted, she cannot vindicate her belief.\n\nObjection 3: Epistemic Luck. Automatic processes may deliver true beliefs by accident. Without conscious monitoring, how do we screen off lucky correlations?\n\nReply. Screening is achieved by focusing on type-level reliability of the subpersonal mechanism and on its integration in the agent\u2019s cognitive system. A one-off lucky guess lacks such integration and fails the diachronic availability test: the subject would not reproduce or justify the belief under varied conditions. By contrast, perceptual modules are robust, functionally entrenched, and support counterfactual sensitivity.\n\nObjection 4: Deviant Causal Chains. Suppose a brain lesion causes both a perceptual cue and the belief; the cue is not the explanatory ground. My etiological criterion seems satisfied yet basing fails.\n\nReply. Deviance arises when causation bypasses the normal inference path. The remedy is to add a structural constraint: R must figure in a normal-function causal pathway subserving accurate belief formation as designed by natural selection or learning. The lesion case fails this constraint; hence basing is blocked. Awareness plays no role here.\n\n6. Implications and Further Directions\n\nThe view defended shifts the debate in three ways.\n\nFirst, it locates epistemic status at a hybrid level: neither purely first-personal nor purely subpersonal but across time and architecture. This reframing dissolves the stale internalism\u2013externalism dichotomy by assigning each camp a piece of the truth: externalists are right that unconscious processes can justify; internalists are right that accessibility matters\u2014but accessibility is modal, not occurrent.\n\nSecond, the account offers guidance for empirical epistemology. When evaluating AI systems or predictive-coding models for epistemic propriety, we should ask: (a) Do their sub-systems encode content that functions as reasons? (b) Is there an interface enabling higher-level modules to inspect or modulate those reasons? These questions align with work on explainable AI, suggesting a convergence of epistemology and engineering.\n\nThird, diachronic availability bears on moral responsibility. Many implicit biases are automatic; whether an agent is blameworthy for biased judgment hinges on whether she can, through reflection and feedback, surface and correct the subpersonal grounds. Our framework yields a principled, non-behaviorist test for responsibility.\n\n7. Conclusion\n\nLack of conscious awareness at the moment of belief formation does not preclude a mental state from being epistemically based on reasons. What matters is that the reasons\u2014understood as content-bearing states in the cognitive system\u2014stand in the right functional relation to the belief and are diachronically available for conscious endorsement or revision. This two-tier model honors the cognitive-scientific reality of modular inference while preserving the normative core of epistemic responsibility. Conscious awareness matters, but chiefly as a capacity to take up and refine the reasons our minds often supply in silence.", "output_tokens": 2633, "reasoning_tokens": 320}

Orientation and Thesis  \n\nIt is hard to deny that much of our cognitive life runs on automatic pilot. I see a cup, and without effort I take it to be three\u2013dimensional; I hear a familiar voice in the next room and immediately believe my friend has arrived.  Ordinarily we treat those perceptual beliefs as paradigmatically justified.  Yet I am not consciously aware of the \u201creasons\u201d that figure in the sub-personal computations transforming retinal stimulation or air-pressure patterns into judgments about cups and friends.  If\u2014 as some philosophers contend\u2014 a subject must be consciously aware of her reasons for a belief in order for that belief to be epistemically based on those reasons, then the vast majority of our everyday justified beliefs would turn out to be unjustified after all.  \n\nI shall defend the contrary view: lack of occurrent conscious awareness of one\u2019s reasons does not preclude a mental state from being epistemically based on those reasons.  What matters is (i) that the belief be produced and sustained by a cognitive mechanism that is appropriately responsive to those reasons, and (ii) that the reasons be available to the subject for conscious uptake given minimal reflection or prompting.  Call this the \u201cavailability model.\u201d  Availability, not occurrent awareness, secures the bridge between sub-personal processing and personal-level epistemic responsibility.  I aim to show that the availability model captures the intuitions that motivate the awareness requirement while avoiding its implausible sceptical fallout, and that it sits better with cognitive-scientific evidence than a strict awareness condition.  \n\n2. Two Faces of the Basing Relation  \n\nTalk of a belief\u2019s being \u201cbased\u201d on reasons hides an important ambiguity.  On the one hand, there is explanatory basing: the sub-personal causal story in virtue of which perceptual information, memories, or testimony give rise to a belief.  On the other, there is agential basing: the sense in which the subject, as a rational agent, treats certain considerations as her reasons.  The awareness theorist assumes that the two coincide: unless I consciously treat p as my reason for believing q, p cannot be the factor that justifies q.  But explanatory basing obviously outstrips conscious agential basing; I rarely\u2014if ever\u2014treat the pattern of light on my retina as my reason for believing there is a cup.  Any plausible theory of justification must, therefore, articulate how the two levels interact without collapsing one into the other.  The availability model does so by positing that explanatory basing delivers prima facie justification provided the resulting belief is situated in a cognitive system that would, under normal reflection, allow the subject to vindicate it in agential terms.  \n\n3. Why Some Want Conscious Awareness  \n\nThe awareness requirement is typically defended on three interlocking grounds.  \n\na. Deontological responsibility.  If justification is the basis of epistemic praise and blame, then it must track what the subject can control; only consciously accessible reasons seem to lie within the scope of control.  \n\nb. Guidance and revision.  A reason, the thought goes, can guide belief revision only if the believer knows what it is; unconscious reasons cannot be cited when challenges arise.  \n\nc. The space of reasons.  Following Sellars, many hold that justification essentially involves positioning a belief within a network of inferential commitments.  To occupy that space is to be able, in principle, to vindicate one\u2019s claim; conscious articulation is taken as the mark of membership.  \n\nThese are serious pressures.  Any account that jettisons the awareness condition must show that we can preserve responsibility, guidance, and inferential articulation without requiring the agent always already to have her reasons in view.  \n\n4. Everyday Cognition: A Sceptical Cost of the Awareness Condition  \n\nConsider normal visual perception.  I look out the window and judge that the sky is overcast.  If someone asks why, I can cite the appearance of grey clouds.  But at the moment of forming the belief I was not explicitly aware of the appearance as a \u201creason\u201d; I simply saw the sky.  Or take memory: when I recall that Canberra is Australia\u2019s capital, I rarely recall the geography lesson that implanted this fact.  More strikingly, implicit-learning cases\u2014 the expert chicken-sexer or radiologist who cannot articulate how she knows\u2014 show that subjects can track reliable environmental cues that elude introspective access altogether.  \n\nIf the awareness condition were correct, perceptual and mnemonic beliefs formed in the ordinary way, along with expert intuitive judgments, would lack justification.  That conclusion is not a reductio only if we are willing to embrace a radical internal scepticism.  Most awareness theorists do not intend such scepticism; hence they need a principled distinction between the suspect automatic cases and everyday perception.  No such distinction has been forthcoming.  The availability model, by contrast, straightforwardly counts normal vision, memory, and even much expert intuition as justified, while still allowing pathological cases\u2014say, a brain tumor inducing a paranoid belief\u2014 to fall outside the scope of justification because the belief would not survive minimal critical reflection.  \n\n5. The Availability Model Explained  \n\nAvailability has two components:  \n\n(i) Systemic reason-responsiveness: The belief-forming mechanism must respond to factors that are in fact good reasons.  A visual system that tracks surface layout under normal lighting conditions is such a mechanism; a wish-projection faculty is not.  \n\n(ii) Access upon reflection: Were the subject to attend, she could\u2014perhaps after a brief search\u2014 cite considerations that suffice to justify the belief.  Importantly, we need not require that she articulate sub-personal algorithms; saying \u201cbecause I can see it\u201d or \u201cthe book says so\u201d is usually enough.  \n\nThese two components together vindicate epistemic agency.  The reasons that justify my belief about the cup are the very perceptual cues my visual system tracks; agentially, I can cite what I see.  Responsibility is preserved because, had I noticed that the lighting was misleading or that the cup was a hologram, the same mechanism would have delivered corrective input, and I would be criticisable for ignoring those defeaters.  And because minimal reflection can make the supporting considerations explicit, the belief can play its role in the space of reasons when challenges arise.  \n\n6. Blindsight vs. Normal Vision: A Test Case  \n\nBlindsighters exhibit reliable discrimination of stimuli in their blind fields while sincerely denying visual awareness.  Empirically, their guesses track the stimuli; explanatorily, visual-processing areas below V1 do the heavy lifting.  Yet most philosophers hesitate to attribute perceptual justification to blindsight judgments.  On the availability model that hesitation is explained: although the mechanism is reason-responsive, the subject lacks the capacity to bring the relevant reasons into consciousness even under optimal prompting.  The blindsighter cannot say \u201cI see a vertical grating\u201d because nothing is phenomenally available.  Thus the second condition\u2014 access upon reflection\u2014fails, and the belief remains unjustified.  Normal vision passes both tests.  The awareness theorist, in contrast, delivers the same verdict on both cases: neither involves occurrent awareness, hence neither is justified.  Our discriminatory verdict thus speaks in favor of availability over awareness.  \n\n7. Addressing the Deontological Objection  \n\nDoes availability suffice for epistemic responsibility?  Imagine a driver whose well-tuned but unconscious perceptual skills detect a pedestrian in peripheral vision, prompting an automatic swerve.  If the driver later claims he \u201cjust did it,\u201d we still praise his attentive driving; conversely, if the same automatic faculties were impaired by alcohol, we blame him.  Responsibility tracks the reliability of the sub-personal process plus the agent\u2019s standing capacity to monitor and correct it when given reason.  That is precisely what availability captures.  Conscious awareness at the moment of judgment is neither necessary nor, as habitual biases show, sufficient for responsible belief.  \n\n8. Objection: Can Unconscious Reasons Guide Revisions?  \n\nSuppose a friend objects, \u201cYour belief that the sky is overcast is wrong; that\u2019s a painted backdrop.\u201d  Can the perceptual reasons that initially produced my belief guide a revision if they were never conscious?  Yes.  I attend, notice incongruent features (the \u2018clouds\u2019 do not move), and update\u2014 all without recourse to esoteric retinal arrays.  Guidance is mediated by the same mechanism: newly available cues defeat the old ones, and because they are available to me on reflection, I can cite them if needed.  Again, availability, not occurrent awareness, is doing the normative work.  \n\n9. A Worry from the Sellarsian Space of Reasons  \n\nOne might object that unless the subject is positioned to endorse an explicit inference, the belief remains outside the normative space altogether.  But this is too intellectualist.  Infants and non-linguistic animals engage in perception-based learning that is normatively assessable\u2014 think of a chick pecking only red grains after a punishing experience with green ones.  What they lack is sophisticated inferential articulation, but they possess a primitive form of reasons-responsiveness.  Human adults enjoy a richer version of that same responsiveness, and reflection makes their commitments explicit when required.  The availability model thus preserves the insight of the Sellarsian picture\u2014beliefs must be answerable to reasons\u2014without collapsing justification into actual self-conscious inference.  \n\n10. A Novel Distinction: Manifest vs. Latent Reasons  \n\nThe discussion so far has relied on a pragmatic notion of availability.  Let me sharpen it with a distinction that, I submit, sheds new light on the debate.  A reason is manifest for a subject when it is occurrently represented in personal-level cognition (attention, working memory).  A reason is latent when it is represented only sub-personally but is poised to become manifest given the right cue (a question, a challenge, focused attention).  The availability model claims that latent reasons can justify.  What makes them reasons, rather than mere causes, is that they stand in a functional role that licenses their promotion to manifest status in the regulation of belief.  This \u201cpoise\u201d criterion draws a principled boundary between tumor-induced delusions (whose causes lack the requisite poise) and perceptual beliefs (whose sub-personal representations are always ready for conscious citation).  The manifest/latent distinction, I suggest, reframes the problem: the real issue is not awareness versus non-awareness, but whether the sub-personal basis is integrated into the cognitive economy in a way that makes rational uptake possible.  \n\n11. Application to Expert Intuition and Implicit Bias  \n\nExpert chicken-sexers can reliably tell male from female chicks within a second yet cannot articulate how they know.  Are their beliefs justified?  On my account, yes\u2014provided that (a) their discriminatory ability is trained on the right environmental features (reason-responsive) and (b) they could, given time and scientific investigation, articulate the features (subtle feather patterns, odors) that their perceptual system tracks.  That those features are currently latent does not undermine justification.  Contrast implicit racial bias: a hiring committee member may feel an indefinable \u201cbad fit\u201d and vote against a candidate.  Here the causal basis is not reason-responsive to genuine job-relevant features, and attempts at reflection typically expose stereotype-driven distortions.  Latency alone is not enough; reason-responsiveness remains crucial.  \n\n12. Relation to Existing Theories  \n\nThe availability model can be viewed as a rapprochement between internalist evidentialism (Conee & Feldman) and externalist reliabilism (Goldman).  Like reliabilism, it privileges sub-personal reliability; like evidentialism, it requires that epistemic reasons be in principle accessible to the thinker.  But it departs from both by foregrounding the manifest/latent distinction and by tying accessibility to the functional architecture of cognition rather than to introspective acuity.  This hybrid strikes me as a fruitful way forward, one that empirical work on metacognition, error monitoring, and predictive coding is well-placed to refine.  \n\n13. Summing Up  \n\nWe began with a challenge: if justification requires conscious awareness of reasons, automatic and modular processes seem epistemically suspect.  I have argued that the challenge dissolves once we replace the awareness condition with the availability model.  A belief is justified when (1) it is produced by a mechanism that is appropriately reason-responsive, and (2) the considerations to which that mechanism is sensitive are latent reasons\u2014poised to become manifest under minimal reflection.  This account secures epistemic agency, guards against pathological causes, and aligns with cognitive science.  Unconscious reasons can indeed be genuine reasons, provided they are the right kind of unconscious reasons.  The space of reasons, it turns out, extends deeper into the mind than consciousness alone.", "output_tokens": 3343, "reasoning_tokens": 576}

This is the \u201cbasing requirement.\u201d The dispute at hand concerns what *having* one\u2019s belief \u201cbased on\u201d a reason amounts to. Does it require that the believer consciously entertain, represent, or know the reason as a reason? Some internalists say yes: unless the subject can cite the reason on reflection, the belief is not genuinely *based* on it and thus is not justified. If that view is correct, much of our ordinary cognitive life\u2014including perceptual belief, rapid probabilistic judgment, and rule-governed linguistic comprehension\u2014would be epistemically suspect, for the operative processes in those domains are typically swift, automatic, and sub-personal. I will resist the consciousness requirement. Lack of conscious awareness does not, by itself, preclude a mental state from being epistemically based on the reasons that in fact support it. To make that case, I proceed as follows.\n\n1. I distinguish four senses in which a subject might be \u201caware\u201d of a reason and explain why only one matters to the consciousness theorist.  \n2. I reconstruct the best arguments *for* the consciousness requirement, extracting three independent rationales: (a) a deontic responsibility rationale, (b) a transparency or phenomenological rationale, and (c) an agency or guidance rationale.  \n3. I argue that each rationale overstates what justificatory practice demands. We can vindicate the core insights behind those rationales without demanding occurrent awareness.  \n4. I offer a positive \u201cdual-level\u201d account of epistemic basing that accommodates modular, automatic cognition while preserving epistemic normativity. The key is the notion of *subpersonal uptake* and a *potential awareness condition*: justification requires not that one presently entertains one\u2019s reasons, but that one\u2019s cognitive system is suitably disposed to make those reasons available under reflection.  \n5. I close by reflecting on two lingering worries\u2014deviant causal chains and epistemic responsibility\u2014and show how the dual-level model handles them.\n\nI. Four grades of awareness  \n\nLet\u2019s mark four increasingly demanding grades on which a subject S might be \u201caware\u201d of a reason R for believing proposition p.\n\nGrade 0: *Subpersonal registration*. R is encoded somewhere in S\u2019s cognitive system and plays a causal role in producing belief-state B, but S has no personal-level access to that encoding.\n\nGrade 1: *Dispositional availability*. While S is not currently conscious of R, she could, through ordinary reflection, become aware of it without acquiring new information. Audi (2001) calls this \u201cpotential cognizance.\u201d\n\nGrade 2: *Occurrent nonreflective representation*. R is consciously present as part of the phenomenology of S\u2019s doxastic episode\u2014e.g., I *see* a red cup and promptly believe there is a red cup.\n\nGrade 3: *Occurrent reflective endorsement*. S not only entertains R but takes it *as* a reason, endorses the inference, and stands ready to cite it in answer to \u201cWhy believe p?\u201d\n\nAdvocates of the consciousness requirement typically have Grades 2 or 3 in mind. By contrast, the cognitive-science data that seem to threaten justification tend to describe cases that involve only Grades 0 and 1. So before adducing arguments, we should note that much of the debate hinges on which grade we take to be necessary.\n\nII. Three rationales for a consciousness requirement  \n\nA. Deontic responsibility. Many argue that justification is a kind of epistemic permissibility. One can be evaluated as blameworthy or praiseworthy *only* for states over which one exercises voluntary control, and that presupposes awareness of the relevant reasons. If a belief is formed \u201cbehind one\u2019s back,\u201d so to speak, it might be excusable but not justified.\n\nB. Phenomenological transparency. It seems natural to think that when we inspect why we believe, the explanatory factors become manifest in consciousness. I look at the cup, form a belief that it is chipped, and it *appears* to me that my perception is what licenses the belief. If justification is normally transparent, then any putative justification that is *in principle* opaque to consciousness is suspect.\n\nC. Agency and guidance. On one line of thought tracing back to Kant, to count as an *agent\u2019s* reason the factor must be able to guide her reasoning in real time. Guidance requires that the factor be something the subject can take up and, if needed, re-deploy in novel contexts. Subpersonal causes lack this agential role and therefore cannot be epistemic reasons.\n\nIII. Diagnosing the rationales  \n\nA. Deontic responsibility reassessed. The awareness theorist moves too quickly from \u201ccontrol requires awareness\u201d to \u201cjustification requires awareness.\u201d First, justification concerns what *epistemically ought* to be believed, not directly what one is blameworthy for believing. One can be justified yet irresponsible (the lucky novice meteorologist whose gut feelings track the weather) and responsible yet unjustified (the overconfident forecaster who dutifully follows a broken barometer). Second, awareness is not the only route to control. Automatic skills\u2014think of linguistic competence\u2014are under the subject\u2019s rational control in the sense that they are *sensitive* to higher-order interventions: if I suspect the interlocutor is joking, I reinterpret his words. Thus deontic considerations yield, at most, a derivative *accessibility* requirement: the believer must be able to *take responsibility* for the belief upon reflective challenge, not be aware from the outset.\n\nB. Transparency under scrutiny. Phenomenological transparency is an unreliable guide to cognitive structure. Psychological evidence on confabulation (Nisbett & Wilson, 1977) shows that subjects routinely *confuse* post-hoc rationalizations with authentic basing relations. Conversely, perceptual beliefs remain justified even where phenomenology misleads: in inattentional blindness experiments, subjects are justified in believing that nothing odd occurred, though the relevant visual scene never reached phenomenal awareness. Transparency thus fails as a necessary condition. At best, it supports the claim that *sometimes* justification is apparent to consciousness, not that it must always be.\n\nC. Agency and guidance revisited. Agency need not be tied to the occurrent uptake of reasons. Consider skilled chess play: grandmasters instantly \u201csee\u201d that a certain move is forced, without consciously going through the combinatorics that warrant the conclusion. Yet they can, if pressed, reconstruct a rationale. What guides their play is the *reliably operating inferential module* that encodes chess-specific regularities. The role of the subject is to *vouch for* that module\u2019s outputs. Guidance, therefore, can be mediated through dispositions to reflectively endorse rather than occurrent awareness.\n\nIV. A dual-level basing model  \n\nThe preceding diagnoses point toward an alternative picture that preserves the normative bite of reasons while liberated from a stringent consciousness requirement.\n\nCore claim: A belief B is *epistemically based* on reason R for subject S iff\n\n(1) Subpersonal uptake: R is causally efficacious in producing B by a process \u03c0 that is of the appropriate epistemic type (reliable, truth-conducive, knowledge-yielding, pick your preferred condition).  \n(2) Reflective potential: S retains the standing capacity, given mild reflection and without the importation of new information, to avow R as a reason\u2014i.e., to upgrade from Grade 0 to at least Grade 1 awareness.  \n(3) No defeaters: There is no undefeated higher-order evidence that \u03c0 is malfunctioning in the context.\n\nClause (1) captures the cognitive-science insight: perception, language modules, Bayesian heuristics, and the like can do genuine epistemic work. Clause (2) honors the internalist intuition that justification must not be entirely alien to the subject\u2019s rational capacities. Clause (3) secures the usual safeguard against deviant causal chains.\n\nWhy is \u201creflective potential\u201d rather than occurrent consciousness sufficient? Because epistemic appraisal is typically a *diachronic* project. We first form beliefs by trusting perception, testimony, memory, and inference; we then evaluate, improve, or discard those beliefs on demand. The basing relation must therefore be stable across temporal phases: it is the underlying cognitive architecture\u2014liable to rational scrutiny if called upon\u2014that confers justification, not the spotlight of immediate consciousness.\n\nConsider three emblematic cases.\n\nBlindsight. A patient with cortical damage reports no visual phenomenology in the blind field yet guesses object locations above chance. Is her belief that an object is at x justified? On the proposed model, normally no: Clause (2) fails because she lacks the capacity to *upgrade* her registration of the stimulus to personal-level avowal. She treats the guesses as random and so cannot take responsibility for them. Notice that what disqualifies justification is not lack of consciousness *per se*, but lack of *availability*.\n\nImplicit probabilistic reasoning. People are surprisingly good at certain statistical predictions (e.g., which of two sequences is more likely under a simple grammar) without knowing the rules. Provided the cognitive process is reliable (Clause 1) and the subject would, upon reflection, accept considerations like \u201cthe longer run with fewer runs of the same symbol is more typical\u201d (Clause 2), the beliefs are justified.\n\nPerceptual belief. Ordinary perceptual beliefs satisfy Clause (1) by being generated via the visual system and Clause (2) because we can typically cite the perceptual appearance if questioned. No further requirement of occurrent reflection is needed.\n\nV. Distinguishing reasons from mere causes  \n\nA remaining worry is that the dual-level model reduces reasons to mere reliable causes, undermining the normative dimension. The worry is misplaced. Clause (2) ensures that the believer is positioned to *ratify* the subpersonal cause as a reason; Clause (3) blocks \u201cdeviant causal chains\u201d in which the cause, though reliable in general, misfires in the specific instance. Suppose an evil neuroscientist implants a radio in my brain that reliably produces true beliefs about tomorrow\u2019s weather. Until I have some handle\u2014however defeasible\u2014on that source, I cannot avow it, and my resulting beliefs are not justified even though the process is (ex hypothesi) reliable. Awareness in the *potential* sense thus safeguards normativity.\n\nVI. Addressing two residual objections  \n\nObjection 1: The account still lets in too much. A subject might be disposed to cite spurious reasons post-hoc (\u201cBecause it felt right\u201d) even though the actual subpersonal process was non-truth-conducive. Reply: the subject\u2019s capacity must be *veridical*\u2014she must stand ready to provide a correct outline of the epistemic link. Empirical data suggest humans often confabulate, but once their confabulations are exposed, the justificatory status collapses. The model predicts exactly that: failure of Clause (2) on reflection removes justification retroactively.\n\nObjection 2: The model collapses into orthodox externalism. Reply: Unlike pure externalism, the dual-level view embeds an internalist accessibility condition. Two agents could be word-for-word process clones; if one is sealed off from ever accessing the operative reasons (because of, say, semantic deference she cannot grasp), her beliefs are not justified, whereas the other\u2019s are. The position is best described as *moderate evidentialism*: reasons do the justificatory work, but one need not *occurrently* grasp them.\n\nConclusion  \n\nConscious awareness of one\u2019s reasons is neither necessary nor sufficient for epistemic basing. It is not necessary, because subpersonal uptake married to potential awareness can ground justification for the full range of automatic cognitive processes that empirical psychology reveals. It is not sufficient, because one can consciously adopt a reason in a deviant causal chain and thereby form an unjustified belief. What matters is a dual-level relation: the cognitive system must register the reason in a way that is counterfactually sensitive to its evidential status, and the subject must stand ready, upon minimal reflection, to make that registration manifest in conscious reasoning. This framework preserves the integrity of modular cognition while safeguarding the normative concept of basing that underwrites epistemic responsibility. The upshot is a reconciliation, not a capitulation: consciousness retains an important regulative role, but justification begins before the lights of introspection are turned on.", "output_tokens": 3426, "reasoning_tokens": 768}

Stage-setting and Thesis  \n\nCan a belief, judgment, or perceptual seeming be epistemically based on reasons of which the thinker is altogether unaware? I shall defend a qualified Yes: conscious awareness of one\u2019s reasons is neither necessary nor sufficient for epistemic basing. What matters is that (i) the relevant content actually figures in the belief-forming etiology in a way that (ii) manifests the subject\u2019s epistemic competence\u2014a competence that need not issue in occurrent awareness, though (iii) it must remain, in principle, accessible to the person for the purposes of critical assessment and defeat-handling. Automatic, modular processes can therefore generate epistemically grounded states, provided that the reasons they exploit are available to the subject under conditions of reflection; the perspectival space between subpersonal processing and personal-level scrutiny is bridged not by continuous consciousness, but by a standing capacity for uptake.\n\nI proceed in six steps: (1) clarifying \u201cbasing,\u201d (2) rehearsing the consciousness requirement and its motivations, (3) developing three counter-arguments, (4) offering a positive competence-accessibility model, (5) answering two residual worries, and (6) drawing broader morals for epistemology of cognition.\n\n2. What It Is To Base A Mental State On Reasons  \n\n\u201cB is based on R\u201d can be read in at least three ways:\n\na. Mere Causation: R causally occasions B, irrespective of epistemic propriety.  \nb. Manifest Rational Etiology: R not only causes B but does so because of its indicative content, in a way that would sustain justification.  \nc. Personal-Level Avowal: the thinker endorses R as her reason.\n\nOnly (b) is at stake in the present debate. (a) is too weak (thermometers \u201cbase\u201d their readings on mercury expansion), while (c) bakes in consciousness by definition. The salient question is whether (b) can be satisfied without contemporaneous awareness.\n\n3. The Consciousness Requirement: Why Some Find It Compelling  \n\nTwo main lines of thought lie behind the requirement.\n\nArgument from Agency. Epistemic evaluation is evaluation of the person as a rational agent. If the agent is literally oblivious to the considerations that move her, she seems more like a puppet than a reasoner. Hence, no credit, no justification.\n\nArgument from Intuitions of Access. When we confront a subject who cannot, even in principle, say why she believes p, we are reluctant to deem her justified. This intuitive link between being able to cite reasons and being justified tempts one to think that conscious access is essential.\n\n4. Three Counter-Arguments  \n\n4.1 The Silent Expert  \n\nA seasoned radiologist glances at a lung scan and judges malignancy in under a second. She cannot articulate the specific pixel patterns that led her to this conclusion, but her judgment is robustly reliable and causally sensitive to relevant radiographic features. The judgment is justified; what mediates it is a tacit encoding of diagnostic reasons, not mere clairvoyance. If the consciousness requirement were right, we would have to say either (i) she is unjustified (implausible) or (ii) her judgment is not based on reasons but on \u201cblind\u201d reliability (also implausible, for the features are evidential). The better diagnosis: reasons are encoded subpersonally; occurrent awareness is dispensable.\n\n4.2 The Linguistic Comprehender  \n\nYou effortlessly understand this sentence, yet cannot list the syntactic rules applied. Your occurrent state of comprehension is nonetheless based on linguistic reasons\u2014the semantic contributions of its parts. Language modules perform the inference; your later reflection could make that structure explicit, but need not do so synchronically.\n\n4.3 The Evolutionary Regress  \n\nIf every stage of reasoning had to be conscious, one would need a further bit of consciousness to recognize the first, leading either to infinite regress or to a gratuitous stopping point. Postulating unconscious but content-respecting transitions halts the regress and mirrors neuroscientific reality.\n\nThese cases reveal that the agency and access arguments target something real\u2014a demand that the agent not be epistemically alienated\u2014but mistakenly infer a requirement of ongoing consciousness.\n\n5. A Positive Proposal: Competence Plus Critical Accessibility  \n\nTake Ernest Sosa\u2019s virtue reliabilism as point of departure: a belief is apt iff it is the product of our epistemic competence. I refine this with two ideas.\n\nCompetence Condition. The process must be a skill of the subject, integrated into her cognitive agency. A modular system qualifies when it is functionally owned by the person: it is under her executive jurisdiction (she can suspend, double-check, or outsource it).\n\nCritical Accessibility Condition. While occurrent awareness is not demanded, the deliverances must be, in principle, surveyable on reflection. The radiologist can, upon inquiry, slow down, trace diagnostic cues, or defer to statistical evidence. The linguistic comprehender can consult grammar. If no such possibility exists\u2014as with clairvoyance or a deviant causal chain\u2014the state fails to be epistemically grounded.\n\nThe picture respects both subpersonal scientific realism and personal-level normativity: automatic inference counts as basing when nested in a competence that the agent could bring to the court of reasons.\n\n6. Residual Worries and Replies  \n\n6.1 Over-Intellectualization? One might complain that \u201cin principle accessibility\u201d smuggles consciousness back in. Reply: the accessibility may remain counterfactual; what matters is the modal profile, not the subject\u2019s actual occurrent states. We avoid the regress without banishing reflection.\n\n6.2 Defeat and Error. If the subject is unaware, how can she notice counter-evidence? Answer: the competence itself involves defeat-sensitivity. When contrary signs appear, the same modular subsystem raises an \u201canomaly flag,\u201d making the conflict personally available. Thus, lack of initial awareness does not immunize the belief against revision.\n\n7. Broader Implications and Conclusion  \n\nInsisting on conscious awareness as a standing gatekeeper of epistemic basing mistakes the phenomenology of cognition and hampers epistemology from integrating with cognitive science. Our best explanatory framework treats the mind as a layered architecture: subpersonal modules generate candidate conclusions; personal-level agency governs endorsement, revision, and communication. Reason-based basing occurs wherever (i) evidential content steers formation and (ii) the resulting state lies within the owner\u2019s rational jurisdiction. Conscious awareness is valuable\u2014for teaching, deliberation, and social accountability\u2014but it is not the sine qua non of epistemic grounding.\n\nHence we should reject the consciousness requirement. Automatic, modular processes can, and often do, confer genuine epistemic justification, provided they operate as integrated competences whose outputs remain critically accessible. Such a view reconciles internalist intuitions about ownership with externalist insights about subpersonal information processing, marking a path forward for a naturalized yet normatively robust epistemology.", "output_tokens": 1836, "reasoning_tokens": 384}

A mental state S held by subject A can be epistemically based on reason R even if A is not consciously aware of R, provided that (i) R functions as an operative reason in the formation or sustenance of S, (ii) A is in principle answerable for S in light of R\u2014i.e., if circumstances made R salient, A could take it up as a conscious consideration without having to repudiate S\u2014and (iii) the cognitive system that makes R operative is appropriately truth-tracking.  Conscious awareness is sufficient for basing but not necessary; the normative role usually attributed to awareness is played instead by an \u201canswerability condition\u201d that can be met by modulary, automatic processes.\n\nThe dialectical landscape.  The pro-awareness camp is motivated by a widely shared intuition:\n\n     (1) Basing is an epistemic relation.  \n     (2) Epistemic relations are those for which the subject can be held rationally\n         responsible.  \n     (3) Rational responsibility presupposes conscious accessibility.  \n     Therefore, basing presupposes conscious accessibility.\n\nAnti-awareness theorists concede (1) but typically attack either (2) or (3).  Pure reliabilists dispute (2): they deny that responsibility is essential to epistemic status.  \u201cDark-basing\u201d theorists such as Goldman, Alston, and Williamson retain responsibility but reject (3): they argue that subpersonal processes can ground responsibility even in the absence of occurrent consciousness.  \n\nI side with the latter camp yet think they have not articulated a fully satisfying replacement for (3).  My proposal is that what we really need is not occurrent awareness but a more modest, dispositional capacity to take reasons up if the cognitive ecology makes them salient.  I develop that suggestion in four steps:\n\nI.  Clarifying the basing relation  \nII. Critique of the awareness requirement  \nIII.  The answerability model  \nIV. Objections and replies  \n\nA caution about terminology  \n\n\u201cConscious awareness\u201d can mean several things.  In what follows, \u201cconscious\u201d = \u201cphenomenally conscious,\u201d the sort of awareness that is introspectively available to the subject at the time of reasoning.  \u201cReflective access\u201d means the ability, perhaps after some thought, to cite a consideration as one\u2019s reason.  A state may fail the first test yet pass the second (e.g. stored memories retrieved on demand), and vice versa (transparent perception that one cannot articulate).  Pro-awareness theorists usually demand the first or stronger.  \n\nI.  The basing relation  \n\nA belief that p is justified by reason R only if R is not merely available but operative in explaining why the subject believes p.  Mere causation is too weak (the ringing phone causes me to believe my wife is home, but that\u2019s hardly evidence), whereas mere logical support is too strong (I lack infinite background information).  What we need is *epistemically relevant causation*\u2014roughly, R belongs to the causal history of S in a way that properly subserves the goal of forming true beliefs.\n\nTwo influential models try to capture this:\n\n1.  The *Causal\u2013Doxastic* model (Goldman, Conee/ Feldman).  R must causally lead to S via some epistemically respectable process (perception, memory, inference).\n\n2.  The *Dispositional* model (Korcz, Turri).  What matters is that the subject would cite R under suitable prompting; actual causation is optional.\n\nBoth models are compatible with unconscious basing.  On the causal view, the causation can be subpersonal.  On the dispositional view, citation capacity can exist without previous occurrent awareness.  So why does the awareness requirement remain attractive?\n\nII.  Why awareness seems necessary (and why it isn\u2019t)\n\nConsider three paradigms often cited by awareness theorists:\n\na.  The *Chess Grandmaster.*  She instantly intuits that 23\u2026Qh4 is the best reply.  When asked why, she cites \u201cking-side pressure,\u201d \u201cmaterial balance,\u201d etc.  The awareness theorist insists those articulated reasons must have been consciously operative, else the move would be mere guesswork.  \n\nb.  The *Chicken-Sexer.*  The expert sorts chicks male from female in a flash but cannot articulate the basis.  Because she lacks awareness, the sorting seems at best lucky.  \n\nc.  *Implicit Bias.*  A hiring manager feels uneasy about an applicant\u2019s accent without recognizing the stereotype at work.  Lack of awareness allows the bias to count as an epistemic defect.\n\nThe inference often drawn: conscious availability distinguishes epistemic achievement from lucky correlation.\n\nThat inference, however, conflates *awareness* with two other factors:\n\n(\u03b1) Truth-connectedness.  The process must be reliable.  Awareness is only one way (certainly not foolproof) of ensuring reliability.\n\n(\u03b2) Accountability.  The subject must be able to take ownership of the cognitive upshot.  But ownership can be dispositional rather than occurrent.\n\nAnalysis of a-c supports this:\n\na.  The grandmaster\u2019s intuition is produced by a highly reliable, well-trained pattern recognizer.  If pressed, she can reconstruct tactical lines; though those lines were not occurrently before her mind, she is answerable for them.  So she meets (\u03b2) and, by skill, (\u03b1).  Consciousness optional.\n\nb.  The chicken-sexer initially lacks (\u03b2); she cannot reconstruct the subpersonal features she tracks.  Yet research shows that with guided reflection experts eventually articulate cues (shape of vent, spacing of feathers).  She possesses a latent capacity that emerges upon training\u2014precisely our answerability criterion.  Until such capacity develops, her judgments are epistemically fragile, not because they are unconscious but because she fails (\u03b2).\n\nc.  Implicit bias is epistemically defective because the underlying heuristic is unreliable (fails \u03b1) and, upon reflection, the agent typically repudiates it (fails \u03b2).  Its faultiness has nothing to do with its being unconscious per se; conscious prejudice would be no less defective.\n\nHence, the evidential work accomplished by awareness in the classical argument can be discharged by a duo of conditions: reliability plus answerability.  Occurrent consciousness is one way, not the only way, to secure them.\n\nIII.  The answerability model\n\nLet us formalize:\n\nAnswerability Condition (AC).  A subject S is epistemically responsible for believing p on the basis of R if and only if S is disposed, under normal conditions of reflection, to (i) recognize R as supporting p, and (ii) maintain or revise p in ways appropriately sensitive to further information bearing on R.\n\nWhy AC suffices.\n\n1.  Normative Grip.  Responsibility requires that agents can be asked for their reasons.  AC guarantees this: when reflection is prompted, S can take up R and defend or alter p.  \u201cTaking up\u201d need not be synchronous with belief acquisition, only possible without self-alienation.\n\n2.  Regress Avoidance.  The awareness requirement threatens an infinite regress: if holding p requires conscious awareness of R, does that awareness itself require further awareness of why R is good?  AC blocks the regress.  What matters is stable dispositions, not an endless stack of occurrent states.\n\n3.  Cognitive Science.  Contemporary work on dual-process cognition (Evans, Stanovich, Kahneman) shows that System-1 processes often supply hypotheses rapidly; System-2 can vet them.  AC mirrors this architecture.  System-1 does the basing, System-2 ensures answerability.  No violation of epistemic norms arises provided System-2 is available for corrective oversight.\n\nIV.  Objections and replies\n\nObjection 1: The transparency of reasons.  If basing can be unconscious, how do we distinguish genuine epistemic reasons from mere causes?  Suppose you cross your fingers every time you judge probabilities; unbeknownst to you, the proprioceptive cue causally triggers a reliable Bayesian module.  Is finger-crossing now a reason?\n\nReply.  AC filters such cases.  When reflection draws your attention to finger-crossing, you will not endorse it as evidence.  The disposition will be to treat the gesture as irrelevant.  Therefore, despite reliability, finger-crossing fails (\u03b2).  It is a mere cause, not an operative reason.\n\nObjection 2: Deontic intuition.  We blame agents for racist beliefs even if those beliefs arise from unconscious bias.  Doesn\u2019t this show consciousness is irrelevant to responsibility?\n\nReply.  We *do* blame unconscious bias, but notice the mechanism: we demand that agents monitor and correct such tendencies once alerted.  The blame attaches because subjects are answerable under AC; they can, and should, re-evaluate upon reflection.  Consciousness at t\u2080 is not required; the capacity for revision suffices.\n\nObjection 3: Williamson\u2019s luminosity worry.  If answerability depends on potential reflection, are we presupposing that subjects can *know* which dispositions they have?  Yet knowledge is not luminous; there will be margins for error.\n\nReply.  AC does not require certain knowledge of dispositions, only that the dispositions in fact obtain.  A defective self-representation may excuse blame but does not alter the epistemic status of the original belief; the basing relation is between belief and operative reason, not between belief and meta-belief.\n\nObjection 4: Sceptical scenario.  Imagine an envatted cognition system whose unconscious modules are wildly unreliable though subjectively compelling.  The agent meets AC\u2014she would endorse the misleading reasons\u2014but the process fails reliability.  Isn\u2019t that still a problem?\n\nReply.  Exactly; that\u2019s why reliability is a separate necessary condition.  AC handles responsibility; reliability handles truth-connectedness.  Both jointly ground justified belief.  Lack of either defeats justification.\n\nNovel implication.  AC yields an interesting prediction: agents with degraded answerability (young children, certain neurological patients) can possess *animal justification*\u2014warrant sufficient for knowledge-without-reflectivity\u2014yet lack *doxastic justification* in the sense relevant to epistemic appraisal.  This dovetails with empirical findings on metacognition and suggests that epistemic evaluation should be two-tiered.  That theoretical fruit, I submit, is a payoff unavailable on the awareness or pure reliabilist views.\n\nConcrete case study: Morphological computation in cuttlefish camouflage.  \n\nCuttlefish adjust skin patterns in about 250 ms to match surroundings.  There is no cortical representation of spatial frequencies; the skin itself implements a distributed algorithm tracking luminance edges.  Suppose, science-fictionally, that cuttlefish evolved higher-order belief: one could ask a cuttlefish, \u201cWhy do you believe there\u2019s a checkerboard behind you?\u201d  It could not produce an answer; yet the belief arises from truth-tracking processes.  Under AC, the cuttlefish enjoys animal justification; if endowed with minimal metacognitive modules (analogous to octopus problem-solving), it might even satisfy answerability.  The lesson: epistemic basing is compatible with radically embodied, partially unconscious computation\u2014as long as the organism can, in principle, situate its beliefs within the web of reasons when challenged.\n\nV.  Comparative advantages over rival views\n\n1.  Over awareness accounts: avoids regress and vindicates intuitive cases (expert intuition, correctly functioning perception).\n\n2.  Over pure reliabilism: preserves normative notion of responsibility; explains why we still blame implicit bias.\n\n3.  Over dispositional citationism: links citation dispositions to reliability, preventing gaming by rationalization.\n\n4.  Empirical friendliness: maps onto dual-process theory and metacognitive studies.\n\nVI.  What remains conscious?\n\nOne might worry we have rendered consciousness epiphenomenal.  Not so.  Conscious reflection plays at least two crucial epistemic roles:\n\ni.  Error correction and evidence integration across modular outputs (cross-checking perception against testimony, etc.).  \nii.  Public justification\u2014communicative contexts require articulable reasons.\n\nThus, while not strictly necessary for the basing of every belief, consciousness is indispensably valuable for the regulation and social transmission of belief.  The view is *expansive* about epistemic basing but *non-eliminativist* about consciousness.\n\nConclusion.\n\nLack of conscious awareness does not itself preclude a mental state from being epistemically based on reasons.  What matters is (1) the truth-tracking character of the subpersonal process that makes the reason operative and (2) the subject\u2019s dispositional answerability: the capacity to own, revise, and articulate the reason upon suitable reflective prompting.  Conscious awareness is one robust path to satisfying these conditions, but it is not the only path.  Automatic modular cognition, far from being epistemically \u201cblind,\u201d can carry genuine reasons\u2014provided the agent\u2019s cognitive architecture integrates them into a larger space of potential reflection and critical scrutiny.", "output_tokens": 3167, "reasoning_tokens": 384}

Introduction and Thesis\n\nWhen I reach for an umbrella because the sky looks leaden, the visual appearance is (in ordinary cases) my reason for thinking it will rain. Yet the cognitive route from retinal stimulation to my belief about impending drizzle is executed by visual modules and inference engines to which I have no first\u2010person access. Does that hidden processing disqualify the resulting belief from being epistemically based on the appearance of clouds? Some philosophers say \u201cyes\u201d: to count as epistemically grounded, a mental state must be linked to reasons the subject consciously appreciates. I will argue that this Consciousness Requirement is too strict. Occurrent awareness is neither conceptually necessary for the basing relation nor psychologically required for epistemic responsibility. What is necessary is that the reasons be available for uptake in reflection and that they occupy the right causal\u2010normative role in the formation and maintenance of the belief. I defend a dual-level account: subpersonal representations can be genuine epistemic reasons so long as (i) they figure non\u2010deviantly in the etiology of the mental state and (ii) the subject could, by minimal reflection, articulate an appropriate personal-level reason. Conscious access thus matters, but only dispositionally.\n\n2. Clarifying the Terrain\n\n2.1 Epistemic reasons vs. mere causes  \nEpistemic reasons are considerations that (when things go well) make a belief likely to be true and thereby confer justification. They differ from merely causal influences\u2014tiredness, wishful thinking\u2014whose connection to truth is accidental.\n\n2.2 The basing relation  \nA belief B is based on reason R when (i) R plays the right kind of explanatory role in producing or sustaining B and (ii) that explanatory link is epistemically appropriate\u2014roughly, it would justify B if R is true and non-defective.\n\n2.3 Three grades of \u201cawareness\u201d  \n(a) Occurrent awareness: R is in the subject\u2019s current conscious contents.  \n(b) Dispositional awareness: the subject can bring R to consciousness with ordinary effort.  \n(c) Subpersonal representation: R is encoded only in lower-level systems, not readily available to consciousness.\n\nThe debate concerns whether (a) is required for basing, or whether (b) is sufficient, or even (c).\n\n3. The Case for the Consciousness Requirement (CR)\n\nAdvocates of CR typically advance three arguments.\n\n3.1 The Phenomenological Argument  \nDeliberation paradigmatically proceeds by rehearsing considerations. If a putative reason never figures in that phenomenology, it seems dubious to call it \u201cmy reason.\u201d\n\n3.2 The Responsibility Argument  \nJustification is a normative status we can be asked to defend. If I was never even disposed to notice the grounds of my belief, how could I be epistemically responsible for it?\n\n3.3 The No-Ghost Argument  \nWithout the transparency of consciousness, the basing relation dissolves into a murky causal chain; \u201creasons\u201d threaten to become merely occult intermediaries.\n\nThese worries are serious, but each rests on an overly demanding conception of what epistemic agency requires.\n\n4. Three Families of Counterexamples\n\n4.1 Fast but rational perceptual beliefs  \nYou flip the light switch and instantly believe the room is illuminated. The belief is obviously based on perceptual reasons\u2014luminous experience\u2014yet you rarely advert to them before the belief forms.\n\n4.2 Expert automaticity: chicken-sexers and chess grandmasters  \nChicken-sexers can sort chicks by sex with 98 % accuracy after long practice, yet when asked how, they shrug. Similarly, a grandmaster \u201cjust sees\u201d that 19\u2026Qb6 is forced. Their reliability springs from sophisticated pattern recognition, not conscious inference, but the resulting judgments are epistemically creditable.\n\n4.3 Everyday driving  \nWhile talking to a passenger, you slow for a red light. Only if asked do you notice that the light was red. Your belief that braking is prudent is nonetheless based on color perception.\n\nCR must either deny that these beliefs are justified (implausible) or concede that occurrent awareness is not necessary.\n\n5. Dispositionalism about Awareness\n\nThe intuitive pull of CR is captured once we shift from occurrent to dispositional awareness. What matters is not that the subject is presently attending to R, but that R is cognitively available to her upon reflection. Two features support this weaker requirement.\n\n5.1 Epistemic answerability  \nWhen challenged (\u201cWhy brake?\u201d) the driver can immediately cite the red light. That capacity suffices for epistemic responsibility. The chicken-sexer cannot cite a consciously accessible pattern, but she can appeal to the visible appearance of the chick\u2014a genuine, albeit holistic, dispositional reason.\n\n5.2 Diachronic agency  \nMost beliefs are stored without ongoing conscious endorsement. We remain responsible for them precisely because, if the issue becomes salient, we can reactivate and assess their grounds.\n\n6. A Dual-Level Account of Basing\n\nI propose the following conditions for R\u2019s being the reason for which S believes p:\n\nC1. Representational Condition  \nR is tokened in S\u2019s cognitive system with content q that probabilistically supports p.\n\nC2. Proper-Function Condition  \nR is processed by a cognitive subsystem functioning in accordance with its epistemic design plan (biological or learned).\n\nC3. Counterfactual Sensitivity  \nWere R absent or substantially different, S would not (or would likely not) believe p.\n\nC4. Reflective Accessibility  \nS is disposed, under normal circumstances, to cite or acknowledge R as justificatory when prompted.\n\nC1\u2013C3 secure that R is not a deviant cause; C4 secures epistemic responsibility without requiring constant conscious attendance. Conditions C1\u2013C4 jointly accommodate unconscious basing while preserving the normative core of CR.\n\n7. Objections and Replies\n\n7.1 The Responsibility Objection Revisited  \n\u201cDispositional awareness is too cheap; implicit biases satisfy C1\u2013C3 yet remain unjustified.\u201d  \nReply: Implicit biases often violate C2. Their etiology exploits heuristics maladapted to current epistemic environments. They do not track truth in the relevant domain, so they fail as epistemic reasons.\n\n7.2 The Alien Etiology Worry  \nSuppose a neurosurgeon implants in me a disposition to believe p whenever she presses a button that activates a hidden module encoding R. I satisfy C1, C3, and arguably C4. Is the belief justified?  \nReply: Proper-Function (C2) is violated; the implanted mechanism is not aimed at truth in the relevant way. Without that teleological anchor, causal mediation by R does not amount to epistemic basing.\n\n7.3 The Transparency Demand  \n\u201cA reason you can cite only after the fact is not the reason that produced the belief.\u201d  \nReply: The demand confuses epistemic with psychological priority. Rational reconstruction often proceeds from effect to cause (Jakob Hohwy calls this \u2018epistemic engineering\u2019). What matters is not temporal order in consciousness but whether the cited R corresponds to the subpersonal representation that actually shaped the belief.\n\n8. Precision in Distinctions\n\n8.1 Reasons-why vs. reasons-that  \nA subject can cite a proposition (\u201cthe light is red\u201d) that condenses a complex gestalt pattern processed subpersonally. The conscious reason-that need not mirror the subpersonal reason-why; it only needs to be a faithful pr\u00e9cis.\n\n8.2 Personal vs. Subpersonal Levels  \nPersonal-level reasons are the ones apt for social exchange and deliberation; subpersonal reasons are information-bearing states in cognition. The basing relation spans both levels provided the bridging conditions (C1\u2013C4) obtain.\n\n8.3 Justification vs. Excuse  \nConfusing these is why implicit-bias cases look problematic. Biases furnish an explanatory excuse for belief but not an epistemic justification.\n\n9. Comparative Advantages of the Dual-Level View\n\n9.1 Captures scientific reality  \nCognitive science reveals that most inferential heavy-lifting occurs beneath awareness. Any epistemology blind to that fact will systematically misdescribe ordinary justification.\n\n9.2 Preserves internalist intuitions  \nReflective Accessibility ensures that reasons remain \u201cwithin reach\u201d of the subject\u2019s capacities, satisfying the internalist\u2019s insistence on subjective justification conditions.\n\n9.3 Avoids externalist laxity  \nProper-Function plus Counterfactual Sensitivity prevents mere reliable causation from counting as basing; luck and deviant causal chains are excluded.\n\n10. Future Directions\n\n10.1 Degrees of basing  \nThe account predicts gradations: the quicker and more fragile the disposition to cite R, the thinner one\u2019s responsibility. A research program could formalize this in virtue-theoretic terms.\n\n10.2 Pathologies of basing  \nClinical cases\u2014blindsight, anosognosia\u2014test the limits of Reflective Accessibility.

Introduction and Thesis  \n\nI argue that conscious awareness of one\u2019s reasons is not necessary for a mental state to be epistemically based on those reasons, though reflection-level access remains normatively significant. Epistemic basing is fundamentally a matter of the right sort of explanatory relation\u2014call it rational sensitivity\u2014between a cognitive attitude and the considerations that make that attitude correct. Conscious awareness is only one way, and not always the best way, for that explanatory relation to obtain. What matters is that the cognitive system uses the considerations in the production and sustenance of the attitude in a manner that is poised for personal-level uptake without the acquisition of new evidence. Thus automatic or modular processes can ground justification, while a separate\u2014sometimes later\u2014episode of conscious uptake secures higher-order epistemic goods such as responsibility and critical self-control.\n\nThe view has four components:\n\nA. Subpersonal Rational Sensitivity: A process can be genuinely reason-responsive even when it is fast, automatic, and unconscious.  \nB. Poised Accessibility: For a consideration to count as the subject\u2019s reason, it must be encoded in a representational format that is available for direct conscious access, were the subject to attend, without the need for new environmental inputs.  \nC. Tiered Normativity: Justification derives from rational sensitivity (A), whereas blame-related notions such as negligence require either actual or easily prompted awareness (B).  \nD. Reconciling Internalist Intuitions: Because poised accessibility secures the possibility of bringing reasons to consciousness at will, it vindicates the internalist urge to keep epistemology within the subject\u2019s reflective purview while preserving the explanatory indispensability of automatic cognition.\n\nThis hybrid \u201cpoised externalism\u201d preserves what is compelling in the access-based objection yet escapes its most damaging consequences.\n\n2. What the Awareness Requirement Is After  \n\nAdvocates of an awareness requirement typically offer three motivations.\n\n(i) The Personal-Level Constraint: Justification is a normative status, and only personal-level states\u2014those available for rational appraisal\u2014can bear normative statuses.  \n(ii) The Basing/Deviance Worry: Merely causal connections do not suffice. If my belief that the floor is wet is caused by a barometric fluctuation, the wetness is no basis; but if it is caused by my seeing the puddle, it is. Conscious inference supposedly screens off deviant causes.  \n(iii) Epistemic Responsibility: We hold agents responsible only for attitudes they could have recognized as unsupported.\n\nEach motivation is genuine; but none, I contend, requires occurrent awareness. The personal level can be entered \u201con demand,\u201d deviance can be ruled out by functional profile, and responsibility can attach via the capacity for awareness rather than its exercise.\n\n3. Three Problem Cases for the Awareness Requirement  \n\nBefore constructing the positive view, consider three familiar but under-appreciated examples.\n\n3.1 The Expert Chicken Sexer  \nWith little or no articulable reasoning, an expert sorts male from female chicks at dazzling speed and accuracy (often above 98%). Asked how she knows, she shrugs: \u201cI just see it.\u201d Her sorting judgments are nonetheless sensitive to the very morphological features that novices would cite if they could detect them. Few are willing to say her judgments are unjustified.\n\n3.2 Blindsight vs. Residual Vision  \nA blindsighter can guess, above chance, whether a spot appears in her blind field. She is not aware of the stimulus but remains sensitive to it. Here, intuitions divide: some say the guess lacks justification, others that it is weakly justified. Now consider a patient with residual peripheral vision who, although unaware of the edge of a table, instinctively steps around it. The reason-responsive behavior is functionally identical in both cases; yet awareness differs only in degree. A strict awareness criterion delivers conflicting verdicts.\n\n3.3 Rapid Visual Inference in Ordinary Perception  \nNeurophysiology tells us that when you see a cube, dozens of unconscious inferences\u2014from edge detection, to shape-from-shading, to object permanence\u2014occur before any conscious representation emerges. If awareness was required at every link, ordinary perceptual belief would rarely count as justified. We would need to \u201csee\u201d priors, Bayes-factors, and joint probability distributions. No internalist wants that. They exempt perception by fiat, but that looks ad hoc.\n\n4. Subpersonal Rational Sensitivity  \n\nWhat unites the preceding cases is that the cognitive system tracks genuine evidence in a counterfactual supporting way: if the evidence were slightly different, the resulting belief would differ appropriately. This property\u2014what Dretske and Stalnaker once called \u201cinformation-carrying\u201d\u2014is the functional hallmark of epistemic basing.  \n\nRational sensitivity can be formalized: for token evidence e and attitude A, there exists a mapping F such that F(e) = A, and for relevantly similar e\u2032, F(e\u2032) = A\u2032. The mapping embodies the correct evidential relation independently of consciousness.\n\nImportantly, many psychologically real functions F are implemented outside phenomenal awareness. The amygdala subserves fast threat detection; the fusiform gyrus houses face expertise; the cerebellum coordinates predictive motor control. Saying none of these outputs can be epistemically justified would shrink the domain of justified belief to a vanishing point.\n\n5. Poised Accessibility  \n\nStill, the internalist motivations cannot be ignored. We do want a story about how the reasons are the subject\u2019s reasons. The key is the notion of poised accessibility:\n\nPoised Accessibility Condition (PAC): A consideration c is poised for S iff c is tokened in S\u2019s cognitive architecture in a format that can be made phenomenally or cognitively manifest to S by deploying only attention and working memory, without requiring new sensory inputs or radical cognitive restructuring.\n\nPAC draws on empirical findings about access consciousness. Information in the \u201cglobal workspace\u201d can be broadcast to executive modules when attention selects it; information in modality-specific buffers cannot. Reasons that are merely sub-personal but nowhere poised\u2014say, in retinal ganglion cells\u2014fail PAC. But many unconscious outputs of mid-level vision, long-term semantic memory, or language processing do satisfy it. They are \u201cthere for the taking.\u201d\n\nThis distinction carves the domain more finely than the occurrent/unconscious dichotomy. It places the chicken sexer\u2019s morphological cues within reach (she could, with training, cite them) while excluding brute causal factors like barometric pressure that are not even represented.\n\n6. Tiered Normativity and Epistemic Responsibility  \n\nHow does PAC interact with responsibility? I adopt a two-tier model.\n\nTier-I Justification: S\u2019s belief is prima facie justified if it is produced by a rationally sensitive process (A) whose operative considerations c satisfy PAC.  \nTier-II Appraisal: S is epistemically responsible\u2014immune to blame for negligence\u2014only if S possesses the capacity to attend to c under reasonable reflection. If S ought to have reflected but failed to, she may be culpable despite possessing Tier-I justification. \n\nThe model explains a puzzle about expert heuristics. The chicken sexer is justified (Tier-I), but if she refuses to examine whether her luck holds under new lighting, she can be blameworthy (Tier-II). Similarly, a student using a calculator is justified in her answer so long as the device functions, yet blameworthy if she ignores signs of malfunction. Responsibility tracks deliberative opportunities, not the original formation history.\n\n7. Ruling Out Deviant Causation Without Consciousness  \n\nConsider Davidson\u2019s classic deviant-causal example: climbing a mountain causes nervousness which leads to a slip, fortuitously reaching the summit. Nervousness is not a reason because the causal chain is not rationally sensitive. PAC plus rational sensitivity blocks deviance. Nervousness fails PAC\u2014it is not a representation of a route or grip pattern\u2014while the chain lacks the counterfactual dependence of reasons. Thus consciousness is not the critical barrier; function and format are.\n\n8. Replies to Awareness-Based Objections  \n\nObjection 1: Without awareness, the subject cannot evaluate the reasons; therefore she lacks justification.  \nReply: Evaluation is necessary for responsibility, not for possession of reasons. Infants lack evaluative metacognition yet can have justified perceptual beliefs. PAC ensures that, should the child grow into reflection, the same subpersonal representations can become explicit.\n\nObjection 2: The view collapses into externalism; reliability alone suffices.  \nReply: Not so. Reliabilist theories treat any reliable causal origin as justifying, even factors the subject could never appreciate (e.g., benevolent demons). Poised externalism requires representational encoding that is in principle available to the subject. The view is therefore \u201caccess-friendly externalism,\u201d not pure reliabilism.\n\nObjection 3: Poisedness is vague; how long may an agent take to become aware?  \nReply: Normative vagueness is ubiquitous (e.g., \u201cknows,\u201d \u201cis tall\u201d). PAC is constrained by empirical limits on attention and working memory (roughly, seconds). If accessing c demands months of therapy, c does not count as poised.\n\nObjection 4: What about deep implicit biases guiding belief? They may be poised yet intuitively unjustified.  \nReply: Many biases fail rational sensitivity\u2014they track irrelevant categories (skin tone rather than competence). Moreover, they often resist counterfactual modulation; change the evidence slightly and the biased inference persists. Failing (A) or (B) disqualifies them.\n\n9. Comparison to Competing Theories  \n\nExternalist Views (Burge, Williamson): No awareness required. Strength: captures automatic justification; Weakness: ignores responsibility.  \nClassical Access Internalism (Feldman, Conee): Occurrent awareness or accessible evidence required. Strength: secures responsibility; Weakness: threatens ordinary perception.  \nMentalist Evidentialism (Byerly, Littlejohn): Appeals to mental states as evidence but allows standing awareness. Comes closest to my proposal, but lacks an explicit poisedness condition to separate represented from merely causal factors.  \n\nPoised externalism integrates the best elements: the reliabilist\u2019s tolerance for subpersonal processing, the internalist\u2019s insistence on personal availability, and the evidentialist\u2019s focus on mental representation.\n\n10. Broader Implications  \n\nThe account has four theoretical payoffs:\n\ni. Cognitive Science Compatibility: It vindicates the epistemic status of insights from embodied, predictive, and affective systems that operate below awareness.  \nii. Developmental Continuity: It explains how infants\u2019 justified perceptions mature into articulate knowledge without a magical threshold of \u201cprimitive justification.\u201d  \niii. Epistemic Virtue Ethics: It naturalizes the value of intellectual virtues such as reflectiveness: they matter because they expand the domain of poised content, upgrading Tier-I justification to Tier-II responsibility.  \niv. Artificial Intelligence: It offers criteria for when an AI\u2019s outputs count as epistemically based\u2014namely, when the system has internal representations that are accessible to supervisory modules (analogous to PAC).\n\n11. Possible Extensions and Open Questions  \n\nA. Can poised externalism be quantified? One might measure \u201cepistemic bandwidth\u201d\u2014the volume of poised content per unit time\u2014and correlate it with metacognitive ability.  \nB. Does phenomenology play any irreducible role? Some argue that conscious experience is itself a kind of evidence. My view leaves room for that, but treats it as an optional enhancer rather than a basing requirement.  \nC. Are there pathologies (e.g., anosognosia) where PAC holds but responsibility fails? Exploring such cases could fine-tune the Tier-II condition.\n\n12. Conclusion  \n\nLack of conscious awareness does not automatically bar a mental state from being epistemically based on reasons. What is required is (i) that the cognitive process is rationally sensitive to considerations that constitute evidence, and (ii) that those considerations are poised for conscious uptake, securing ownership and the possibility of reflective endorsement. This poised externalism preserves intuitive judgments about expert automatisms and everyday perception, avoids flooding the basing relation with deviant causes, and honors the moral dimension of epistemology by allocating blame where reflection is feasible. Conscious awareness remains epistemically valuable, not as the gatekeeper of justification, but as the steward of higher-order responsibility.", "output_tokens": 3048, "reasoning_tokens": 448}

Diagnostic introduction  \n\nMost of the beliefs we form during an ordinary day are not the upshot of conscious reflection. I glance at the sky and, without deliberate thought, believe it will rain; I smell coffee and believe my cup is decaf; I read a sentence and effortlessly come to comprehend its meaning. In each case there seems to be a *reason* that makes the belief epistemically appropriate\u2014dark clouds, the distinctive aroma, the printed words\u2014but that reason never reaches focal awareness. Does that unreflective etiology deprive the belief of epistemic standing?  \n\nSome philosophers\u2014call them *access internalists*\u2014say yes. They argue that (i) a mental state is epistemically *based* on reasons only if the subject can consciously cite or entertain those reasons, and (ii) justification (or knowledge) requires such basing. Automatic, modular, or other sub-personal processes may cause beliefs, but without the requisite awareness those beliefs are, at best, *brute* psychological happenings rather than rational achievements.  \n\nI will defend the opposite view: lack of occurrent awareness does *not* preclude a mental state from being epistemically based on the reasons that in fact sustain it. What matters is that the belief be formed and sustained by a *competence* that is (a) sensitive to the right reasons and (b) poised, given ordinary cognitive resources, to make those reasons available to consciousness *on demand*. I call this *the Dual-Level Competence account*. Section-wise:\n\n2. Why the issue matters: basing, responsibility, and cognitive science  \n3. Preliminary distinctions clarifying the dialectic  \n4. The positive argument for unconscious basing  \n5. Objections and replies  \n6. Dual-Level Competence spelled out and applied to modular cognition  \n7. Consequences for epistemic responsibility and intellectual virtue  \n8. Conclusion  \n\n2. Why we cannot shrug the question off  \n\nThe access requirement has intuitive appeal because basing seems to be the *reason-for-which* the agent believes, and how can that fact obtain if she is oblivious to the reason? Yet five widely acknowledged phenomena press the other way:  \n\na. Perceptual knowledge. My belief that there is a tree before me is paradigmatically justified, but only rarely do I consciously advert to the perceptual evidence\u2014say, the characteristic silhouette or stereoscopic disparity.  \n\nb. Memory retrieval. I remember your phone number and type it correctly. Asked why I trust the number, I might have to pause and reconstruct the chain of events that installed it in memory.  \n\nc. Rapid logical inference. Subjects in Wason-type tasks often instantaneously (and correctly) spot a contradiction without being able to state the inference pattern (modus tollens, etc.).  \n\nd. Blindsight. Some cortically blind patients can guess shapes in their blind field at rates far above chance. While they *lack* conscious visual experience, there is a sense in which their guesses are based on genuine visual information.  \n\ne. Computational models. Dual-process theorists (Kahneman, Evans & Stanovich) argue that System-1 cognition is both indispensable and often rationally impeccable, despite operating below the threshold of introspection.  \n\nIf access internalism were correct, virtually all perceptual belief, a sizeable portion of memory knowledge, and large swathes of everyday inference would lose their justificatory footing. That constitutes a reductio\u2014unless the internalist can draw a principled, non-ad hoc line distinguishing the acceptable from the damning cases. I submit they have not.  \n\n3. Untangling the dialectic: five key distinctions  \n\nBefore arguing positively, we need some conceptual hygiene.  \n\n(1) Normative vs. motivating reasons. *Normative* reasons are facts that count in favor of believing; *motivating* reasons are the considerations that actually move the subject. One can have the former without the latter (the evidence exists though ignored) and vice versa (wishful thinking). Basing concerns motivating reasons: is the belief *because* of the epistemically relevant considerations?  \n\n(2) Personal level vs. sub-personal level. The \u201cbelief\u201d level is personal; neural computation in visual cortex is sub-personal. A basing relation can in principle cross these levels: a personal-level belief may be caused by a sub-personal process that tracks evidential relations.  \n\n(3) Occurrent awareness vs. dispositional accessibility. One may not be presently entertaining p, yet be able to recall p with minimal cognitive effort. That dispositional accessibility often suffices for being *aware enough* for responsibility assessments (e.g., driving while absent-minded).  \n\n(4) Justification vs. epistemic blameworthiness. One can violate one\u2019s epistemic duties yet luckily believe truly on good evidence (think of the negligent doctor who nonetheless reads the correct lab result). Responsibility for belief and justificatory status can come apart.  \n\n(5) Basing as explanatory vs. basing as rational. Mere causation is not enough; the cause must be of the right *kind*\u2014it must *rationalize* the belief. The standard Gettier-era example of Smith\u2019s believing Jones owns a Ford because he has a desire to win a bet fails this normative alignment.  \n\nThese distinctions underwrite the Dual-Level Competence view I advance: awareness matters for responsibility, but not always for plain epistemic justification.  \n\n4. A positive argument for unconscious basing  \n\nP1. A belief is epistemically based on a reason R iff R figures in the operation of the subject\u2019s *epistemic competence*\u2014the ability to respond to truth-conducive considerations.  \n\nP2. Epistemic competences are often implemented by sub-personal mechanisms that do not deliver their intermediate data to consciousness. (Perception, memory consolidation, syntactic parsing, and iteration over Bayesian priors are clear empirical examples.)  \n\nP3. A subject can epistemically possess R (have it as her motivating reason) if the competence that uses R is *counterfactually sensitive*: had R been different, the belief would have shifted appropriately, and had the subject reflected, she could, without exotic effort, cite R.  \n\nP4. Therefore, occurrent awareness is unnecessary; what is required is that R be poised for consciousness and actually operative in the competence.  \n\nP5. If P4 is correct, access internalism is false: mental states can be epistemically based on reasons of which the subject lacks present awareness.  \n\nSupport for P3 is crucial. The idea of *counterfactual availability* is familiar from debates over content externalism and reliabilism. Competence, unlike brute causation, carries modal information: it would continue to deliver truth-conducive outputs across close worlds. If a process is both reliable and reasons-sensitive in that modal sense, then the subject enjoys an epistemic status even absent introspective acquaintance.  \n\nIllustration: The Rain-Belief case revisited. The dark-cloud percept triggers a perceptual module trained (evolutionarily and individually) to associate cloud patterns with impending rain. If the sky had been clear, the module would not have produced the belief. Had you queried me\u2014\u201cWhy do you think it will rain?\u201d\u2014I could have answered, perhaps clumsily: \u201cWell, look at those clouds!\u201d That suffices for dispositional accessibility.  \n\nNotice how this differs from Gettier-prone lucky beliefs. Suppose I believe there is danger because my heart is racing; unbeknownst to me, the racing is caused by caffeine, not danger. My competence for detecting danger via heart rate is unreliable; the counterfactual dependence is off. Hence the belief lacks justification. Consciousness never enters the explanation.  \n\n5. Objections and Replies  \n\nObjection 1: The *Transparency of Reasons* objection. Basing is a *personal* relation; only mental states that the agent can cite are properly her reasons. Otherwise, we fall into mere *sub-personal rationality*\u2014a category mistake.  \n\nReply. The objection conflates *ownership* with *awareness*. A perceptual experience is undoubtedly a personal-level state, even when unattended; philosophical tradition treats it as a reason for belief. Denying that perception can justify unless attended commits us to a form of Cartesian skepticism the objector probably wishes to avoid. Ownership is secured by the fact that the experience is part of the subject\u2019s rational economy; it informs action and is available for attention.  \n\nObjection 2: The *Epistemic Responsibility* objection. One ought not believe what one cannot defend. Since responsibility tracks ability to adduce reasons, ignorance of one\u2019s reasons undermines justification.  \n\nReply. We must distinguish *prospective* and *retrospective* responsibility. Prospectively, subjects ought to cultivate faculties that are both reliable and self-monitoring\u2014intellectual virtues. Retrospectively, however, it may be blameless to hold a belief formed by a normally functioning perception even if one cannot, at that moment, articulate the evidence. The internalist\u2019s norm slides from a plausible ideal of reflective responsibility to an implausible requirement on justification.  \n\nObjection 3: The *Deviant Causal Chain* worry. If mere causal sensitivity were enough, we could rig a device that implants true beliefs via chip, tracking the truth of propositions but bypassing the subject\u2019s agency. Such beliefs seem alien, not epistemically creditable.  \n\nReply. Agency is not bypassed when the process is sub-personal but still part of the subject\u2019s *integrated cognitive architecture*. A bypassing chip is an alien module lacking integration: its outputs are not counterfactually dependent on the rest of the agent\u2019s rational system, nor poised for conscious scrutiny. The Dual-Level Competence account therefore includes an *integration constraint*: the reason-sensitive process must interface properly with other belief-updating mechanisms and attention.  \n\nObjection 4: The *Phenomenological Gap* objection. Intuitively, a belief formed without any feel of evidential support is doxastically different from one formed reflectively. That experiential difference must mark a difference in epistemic status.  \n\nReply. Phenomenology is evidence of *how* a belief was formed but need not be constitutive of its justification. Compare moral credit: saving a child reflexively rather than after conscious calculation does not undermine the act\u2019s moral worth. Similarly, phenomenology can ground higher-order epistemic properties (e.g., *assurance*), yet first-order justification depends on the competence\u2019s reliability and sensitivity.  \n\n6. The Dual-Level Competence Model in Detail  \n\nDefinition. A subject S\u2019s belief that p is *epistemically based* on reason R iff:  \n\n(i) Sub-personal level: There exists a cognitive mechanism M that token-processes R and outputs the belief that p, where M is reliable and truth-tracking with respect to the domain.  \n\n(ii) Personal level: S has *stand-by* access to R\u2014she could, through normal reflection, become aware of R without introducing new evidence.  \n\n(iii) Integration: M is situated within S\u2019s larger reasoning system so that its outputs are monitored and can be revised or overruled by other epistemic competences.  \n\nClause (ii) captures traditional internalist insight: reasons must not be forever hidden behind cognitive barriers. Clause (i) captures the externalist insight that *how* the reasons are processed matters just as much as access. Clause (iii) blocks deviant chains and alien implants.  \n\nApplication to modular cognition. Fodor-style modules (e.g., early vision) are informationally encapsulated yet feed their outputs forward to central cognition. Although we cannot inspect the internal processing, the outputs are world-tracking and open to higher-level revision (e.g., we discount visual illusion once we learn about the M\u00fcller-Lyer lines). They thus satisfy the integration condition and, via the outputs\u2019 availability for reflective endorsement, satisfy stand-by access.  \n\nBy contrast, blindsight fails condition (ii). Here the sub-personal mechanism is intact and reliable, but the visual information is not poised for conscious uptake; S denies she has any basis. Hence blindsight\u2019s *guesses* are lucky, not justified. The model captures that intuition.  \n\nAnother test case: implicit bias. Suppose S forms a negative belief about person x because of a bias module. Although S could, under scrutiny, notice the skin color of x, she would not endorse it as a reason. Moreover, the bias mechanism is not truth-tracking. Condition (i) fails: no epistemic basing.  \n\n7. Epistemic Responsibility, Intellectual Virtues, and Education  \n\nThe Dual-Level view can vindicate our ambivalent judgments about justification and responsibility. A belief can be justified (satisfying conditions i-iii) yet for which the agent is blameworthy if she fails to perform reasonable checks when stakes are high. Conversely, the model helps explain why cultivating *reflective* virtues\u2014open-mindedness, intellectual humility\u2014remains important: they enhance the monitoring relation (iii) and the transition from dispositional to occurrent awareness (ii). We thereby preserve the link between justification and the normative demands of inquiry without making immediate introspection mandatory.  \n\n8. Conclusion  \n\nWe began with a prima facie tension: automatic, unconscious processes seem to deliver beliefs with epistemic credentials, yet access internalism denies that such credentials are possible without conscious awareness of reasons. I argued that:  \n\n1. Everyday epistemic practice, cognitive science, and philosophical theory all indicate that much justified belief is unreflective.  \n2. The requirement that reasons be *stand-by accessible* rather than *occurrently conscious* preserves internalist motivations while recognizing sub-personal competences.  \n3. The Dual-Level Competence account, with its tri-partite conditions (reliability, standby access, integration), dissolves the tension: it permits genuine epistemic basing without present awareness, explains why blindsight and implicit bias are defective, and illuminates the distinction between justification and responsibility.  \n\nIf this is correct, the dichotomy between reflective and automatic cognition is epistemically shallower than it first appears. The mind\u2019s hidden layers can earn justification for us, provided they are ours in the relevant counterfactual, integrative, and accessibility-preserving ways. Consciousness may be the court of last epistemic appeal, but much legitimate jurisprudence occurs offstage.", "output_tokens": 3555, "reasoning_tokens": 512}

Orientation and Thesis  \n\nPerceptual beliefs, expert judgments, and ordinary inferences often spring up automatically, without the agent\u2019s being consciously aware of any premise that supports them. Yet many of these beliefs strike us as paradigmatically justified. The chicken\u2013sexer reliably classifies chicks, the mathematician \u201csees\u201d a lemma\u2019s truth in a flash, and you unhesitatingly believe there is a red car in front of you. A growing body of cognitive science suggests that the subpersonal computations underwriting such performances are modular, swift, and opaque to consciousness. Hence the question:  \n\n     Does lack of conscious awareness of one\u2019s reasons preclude a mental state from being epistemically based on those reasons?  \n\nMy answer is a qualified No. Occurrent consciousness of one\u2019s reasons is not necessary for a mental state to be epistemically based on them\u2014so long as (i) the reasons play the right causal-functional role in producing and sustaining the state, and (ii) the subject possesses a standing capacity to make those reasons conscious upon reflective interrogation. Consciousness is normatively relevant, but its necessity is diachronic and dispositional rather than synchronic and occurrent. I defend a \u201cdual-level\u201d model: subpersonal basing suffices for prima facie epistemic status, while personal-level accessibility grounds the agent\u2019s responsibility and entitlement to that status.  \n\nThis position navigates between two extremes. Pure internalism ties justification to what is transparently available here-and-now; pure externalism allows opaque reliability to do all the justificatory work. By distinguishing the metaphysics of basing (how reasons actually operate) from the ethics of believing (what you may be asked to cite), we can respect the cognitive science of automaticity without abandoning the intuitive link between reasons and rational accountability.  \n\n2. Zooming In: What Is the Basing Relation?  \n\nAlmost everyone agrees that being justified requires more than merely having good reasons somewhere in one\u2019s cognitive system; the belief must be \u201cbased on\u201d those reasons. Disagreement erupts over what \u201cbased on\u201d amounts to. Three families of views dominate:  \n\na. Causal-historical: R is a reason for S\u2019s belief that p if R non-deviantly causes S to believe p.  \nb. Doxastic-dispositional: S would cite or be disposed to cite R when challenged.  \nc. Hybrid: R both causally contributes and is available for rational endorsement by S.  \n\nThe consciousness requirement often rides piggy-back on (b). If basing just is the agent\u2019s reflective endorsement or citation of R, subpersonal processes seem immediately disqualified. Conversely, reliabilists favor (a) and readily grant justificatory force to unconscious information processing.  \n\nI propose a hybrid, but one that assigns the two elements to different temporal locations: subpersonal causation anchors initial justification; persisting dispositional accessibility secures the sort of control and answerability characteristic of epistemic agency.  \n\n3. The Case for Consciousness: Four Arguments and Their Limits  \n\nA. The Guidance Argument  \n   1. To be justified is to be able to guide one\u2019s doxastic life by reasons.  \n   2. Guidance requires occurrent awareness of reasons.  \n   Therefore, justification requires such awareness.  \n\nReply: Guidance can be \u201cone-step removed.\u201d Think of driving: much of one\u2019s lane-keeping relies on non-conscious visual processing, yet the driver maintains overall control and can bring perceptual cues to consciousness as needed (\u201cI changed lanes because the car ahead slowed\u201d). Likewise, doxastic guidance is compatible with backstage processing provided the stage can be lit when queried.  \n\nB. The Distinguishing Causes-from-Reasons Argument  \n   Mere causes of belief are ubiquitous (brain lesions, biases). To mark the difference between rational and non-rational causation, the subject must be aware of the considerations serving as reasons; otherwise we cannot tell whether the causal chain is the right kind.  \n\nReply: The legitimacy of the chain can be fixed by its functional profile\u2014its sensitivity to truth-makers, defeat, and counterfactual scenarios\u2014not by the subject\u2019s contemporaneous awareness of each link. When a perceptual module discriminates red from green and is inhibited by low light, it encodes the right sensitivity even if you cannot introspect its computations. Consciousness is evidential for us as theorists, but not constitutive for the subject.  \n\nC. The Responsibility Argument  \n   We blame or praise people for their beliefs. Desert presupposes the agent could have appreciated the reasons. Hence awareness is necessary.  \n\nReply: What matters for responsibility is the agent\u2019s capacity, not its exercise. You are blameworthy for failing to notice obvious evidence you could have consulted; you are not blameworthy for utilizing subpersonal vision rather than introspecting photoreceptor firings. Diachronic accessibility again suffices.  \n\nD. The Phenomenological Intimacy Argument  \n   Believing for a reason feels like \u201cseeing\u201d how the reason supports the proposition; this phenomenology is absent when reasons are unconscious.  \n\nReply: The phenomenology accompanies many but not all justified beliefs (compare your peri-pheral awareness of room lighting). Its absence shows at most that experiential acquaintance is not universal; it does not show the belief lacks epistemic grounding.  \n\n4. The Positive Proposal: A Dual-Level Basing Model  \n\nStep 1: Subpersonal Justificatory Causation (SJC)  \n   A mental state M is prima facie justified for S at t if it is produced and sustained by a cognitive mechanism that (i) is functionally apt to track the truth regarding content p, and (ii) operates without epistemic defeaters present in S\u2019s total evidence. Conscious awareness is not part of SJC. The mechanism may be modular, automatic, or informationally encapsulated.  \n\nStep 2: Personal-Level Rational Accessibility (PLRA)  \n   S is fully entitled to M at t only if, for some short interval after t, S could through ordinary reflection retrieve considerations constituting an epistemic reason-set R such that R satisfies epistemic norms (relevance, non-defeat, etc.) and R is suitably connected to the earlier subpersonal processing.  \n\nCall the conjunction of SJC and PLRA \u201cdiachronic basing.\u201d Immediate consciousness drops out, yet the normative complexion of reasons is preserved.  \n\nWhy regard PLRA as necessary at all? Because (a) it underwrites intellectual virtue\u2014agents learn, revise, and defend beliefs in light of reasons they can in principle scrutinize; (b) it honors the interpersonal practice of asking \u201cWhy do you think so?\u201d The requirement is \u201cmodally robust\u201d rather than temporally punctual.  \n\n5. Illustrative Cases  \n\nCase 1: Normal Vision  \nYou glance and believe \u201cThere\u2019s coffee in my mug.\u201d The perceptual module processes photon arrays, color edges, and shape priors\u2014none consciously available. Later someone asks, \u201cWhy think there\u2019s coffee?\u201d You can cite the dark liquid. PLRA is satisfied; the belief is unproblematically justified.  \n\nCase 2: Chicken-Sexer  \nThe expert believes the chick is female on the basis of a quick look. She cannot articulate the features used. Is PLRA violated? Not necessarily. She can cite: \u201cIt looks to me a certain way, and experience has shown me that chicks with that look are female.\u201d The cited inductive generalization functions as a higher-level reason hooking onto her subpersonal pattern detector.  \n\nCase 3: Blindsight  \nA patient guesses \u201calphabet letter T\u201d when a stimulus appears in the blind field. The guess is reliably correct, yet she insists she is merely guessing. SJC is present; PLRA is absent because she lacks any capacity to retrieve reasons (she has no conscious visual phenomenology or higher-order cues). On the dual-level model, the belief is excusably unjustified: truth-tracking alone is insufficient without the potential for personal-level uptake.  \n\nCase 4: Complicit Bias  \nAn agent forms a negative belief about a job candidate on the mere basis of the candidate\u2019s name, falsely citing \u201clack of experience.\u201d Here PLRA is satisfied (a reason is consciously cited) but SJC is missing; the underlying cause is an unreliable stereotype. The dual-level model straightforwardly classifies the belief as unjustified.  \n\nThe two conditions are, thus, individually necessary and jointly sufficient for epistemic justification.  \n\n6. Addressing Three Objections  \n\nObjection 1: The Accessibility Collapse  \n   If PLRA allows merely potential retrieval, why not count every belief as justified, since in principle any consideration could be confabulated post hoc?  \n\nReply: PLRA is constrained by epistemic norms on proper inferential connection and defeat. Post-hoc confabulations typically fail these tests: they are not reliably linked to the subpersonal mechanism and crumble under scrutiny (\u201cHow exactly does hairstyle show competence?\u201d). The mismatch between cited reason and actual etiology reveals the confabulation.  \n\nObjection 2: Epistemic Luck Worries  \n   Suppose a lucky-guessing mechanism delivers true beliefs but is insensitive to counterevidence. SJC appears satisfied (truth-tracking in actual worlds); PLRA might also be satisfied if the agent can parrot a generalization. Yet the beliefs seem unjustified.  \n\nReply: SJC includes a robustness clause: the mechanism must be disposed to produce true beliefs across close counterfactual situations. The lucky-guessing faculty fails this; it is true here by accident, not by design. Hence SJC is not met.  \n\nObjection 3: Over-Intellectualization  \n   Even dispositional accessibility may over-intellectualize creatures (young children, animals) who appear justified though unable to reflectively cite reasons.  \n\nReply: The model scales via species-relative standards of PLRA. What counts as \u201cordinary reflection\u201d for a dog is not what counts for an adult human. For non-reflective creatures, social practices of holding-responsible play no role, so SJC suffices for the thin notion of justification appropriate to them. The thicker notion\u2014where one may demand reasons\u2014applies where language and higher-order capacities exist.  \n\n7. Comparative Advantages  \n\n1. Empirical Adequacy: The view accommodates data on automatic but reliable cognition.  \n2. Normative Integrity: It preserves the intuition that agents are responsible for beliefs because they can, when challenged, own or revise their reasons.  \n3. Theoretical Unification: It reconciles insights from internalism (importance of first-personal perspective) and externalism (role of reliability), avoiding implausible extremes.  \n4. Diagnostic Power: It explains why blindsight, bias, and clairvoyance differ in justificatory status despite surface similarities in reliability or awareness.  \n\n8. A Novel Distinction: Synchronic vs. Diachronic Transparency  \n\nTraditional accessibility accounts focus on synchronic transparency: reasons must be \u201clit up\u201d right now. My proposal highlights diachronic transparency: reasons must be able to become lit up through normal reflective procedures over a modest temporal window. This move, I suggest, carves the debate at an overlooked joint. Synchronic transparency conflates two roles of consciousness\u2014cognitive processing and public articulation. Once separated, we see that automatic modules can confer justification so long as the agent retains the capacity to bring their outputs under the purview of critical scrutiny.  \n\n9. Consequences for Further Research  \n\na. Epistemic Defeaters: Diachronic basing suggests a refined taxonomy\u2014some defeaters undermine SJC (truth-tracking), others undermine PLRA (reason-retrievability).  \nb. Education and Cognitive Enhancement: Teaching may aim not just to install reliable heuristics but also to scaffold the retrieval pathways by which learners can articulate their grounds.  \nc. AI Epistemology: Artificial systems might achieve SJC-like reliability, yet until they possess a PLRA analogue (ability to display and critique their \u201creasons\u201d), they lack full epistemic agency.  \n\n10. Conclusion  \n\nConscious awareness matters, but not in the blunt, occurrent sense originally envisaged by strict internalists. A belief can be epistemically based on reasons that never surface in real time, provided (a) those reasons are truth-conducive and causally operative, and (b) the subject retains the standing power to draw them into the space of reasons when the need for justification arises. This dual-level, diachronic model respects our practices of holding each other answerable while taking seriously the subterranean marvels of the cognitive unconscious.  \n\nIn short, opacity at the moment of belief-formation does not bar epistemic basing; what counts is the believer\u2019s enduring capacity to illuminate the grounds on which she, whether knowingly or not, already stands.", "output_tokens": 3293, "reasoning_tokens": 576}

Introduction and Thesis\n\nMost of the beliefs we form\u2014about where the coffee mug is, how to conjugate a verb, whether a claim follows from a diagram\u2014arise effortlessly. We rarely, if ever, consciously rehearse the considerations that speak in favor of them. Yet it is natural to think that many of these beliefs are still **epistemically based** on reasons: the location of the mug, the rules of grammar, the properties of the diagram. If so, then conscious awareness of one\u2019s reasons cannot be a standing requirement for epistemic basing, for the phenomenology of ordinary cognition indicates that awareness is often absent.  \n\nI defend the **Weak-Awareness Account**:  \n\n  WA\u2003A subject S\u2019s mental state M is epistemically based on reasons R iff  \n   (i) R non-deviantly causally sustains M at the personal level;  \n  (ii) R is *rationally accessible* to S\u2014S could, by minimal reflection that draws only on capacities she already possesses, make R occurrently available as her reason;  \n (iii) No defeating considerations that are similarly accessible are ignored.\n\nOccurrent conscious awareness is thus sufficient but not necessary for epistemic basing. What matters is *rational accessibility*, a middle position between full \u201cluminosity\u201d of reasons and their being causally inert sub-personal causes. This view preserves the rational agency that motivates awareness requirements while accommodating the epistemic role of modular, automatic, or unconscious cognitive processes.\n\nTo reach this conclusion I proceed as follows. Section 2 clarifies the basing relation and the standard awareness requirement. Section 3 presents three influential arguments for that requirement. Section 4 offers counter-examples and conceptual concerns that undermine those arguments. Section 5 develops the Weak-Awareness Account and shows how it handles automatic cognition. Section 6 replies to four pressing objections. Section 7 sketches broader implications and concludes.\n\n\n\n2. The Basing Relation and the Awareness Requirement\n\nTalk of a belief\u2019s being *based* on reasons picks out the relation that confers epistemic status\u2014justification, warrant, knowledge. Call R the *basing facts* and M the *based-upon mental state*. Two desiderata dominate theorizing about this relation:\n\nD1\u2003Causal Efficacy: R must in the right way produce or sustain M; mere co-occurrence is insufficient.  \nD2\u2003Rational Appropriateness: R must do the right *kind* of work\u2014it must render M epistemically good-making rather than merely explain it psychologically.\n\nThe awareness requirement surfaces as a proposed bridge principle: conscious endorsement of R by S allegedly secures both causal efficacy (one endorses M because of R) and rational appropriateness (one\u2019s reflective grasp makes the transition intelligibly *rational*). Internalist accounts, especially of the Kantian, deontological, or access-internalist variety, typically treat awareness as *necessary* for justification.\n\nPrecisely what sort of awareness? Standard formulations demand either:\n\nA-Occurrent\u2003S now consciously thinks of R and treats it as her reason, or  \nA-Standing\u2003S disposedly knows what her reason is and could report it on demand.\n\nI will argue that both are too strong.\n\n\n\n3. Three Arguments for the Awareness Requirement\n\n3.1 The Phenomenological Argument  \nIntrospection suggests that when we *see* the connection between premises and conclusion\u2014say, in a simple modus ponens\u2014we are *aware* of the premises as our reasons. That phenomenology is then taken as revealing what it is for the inference to be rational.  \n\nProblem: Phenomenology is selective and fallible. Much disciplined reasoning (e.g., expert chess heuristics) feels like *seeing* the answer but is in fact driven by sophisticated pattern detection beneath awareness. Phenomenology therefore under-generalises.\n\n3.2 The Epistemic Agency Argument  \nJustification is a normative status answerable to the subject. To be responsible for her beliefs, S must know what grounds them; otherwise she could not critically assess or revise them upon challenge.  \n\nProblem: Responsibility comes in degrees and can be distributed across time. A driver is responsible for adjusting speed in fog even if she does not keep occurrently aware of every visual cue; what matters is that she *could* bring them to light when needed. Similarly, retrospective endorsement suffices for doxastic responsibility (more on this in \u00a74).\n\n3.3 The Preventing Epistemic Luck Argument  \nIf S is unaware of R, the causal chain from R to M might be *deviant* or lucky. Conscious endorsement ensures non-accidentality: S *bases* her judgment on R rather than merely being caused by R.  \n\nProblem: The appeal to luck conflates *explanatory deviance* with *epistemic deviance*. Many causal chains are non-accidental without being conscious (perceptual belief formation, memory retrieval). What we need is a criterion of *aptness*, not *awareness* per se.\n\n\n\n4. The Case against Necessity\n\n4.1 Routine Perceptual Belief  \nImagine seeing a red cup on the table and unreflectively believing \u201cThere is a red cup.\u201d The belief is justified, indeed paradigm-justified, by your visual experience\u2014yet you typically are not consciously representing *that* experience as a reason. If awareness were necessary, nearly all perceptual justification would lapse.\n\n4.2 Blindsight with Phenomenal Negation  \nPatients with area V1 lesions can point correctly at light sources while sincerely claiming to see nothing. Their \u201cguesses\u201d track environmental facts via visual information unavailable to consciousness. Suppose a blindsighter, on many trials, comes to trust her capacity and forms the belief \u201cA light just flashed.\u201d Internalists deny that this belief is justified because the subject lacks the right phenomenology. Still, ex hypothesi the belief is reliably produced by visual information and is under the patient\u2019s rational control: she deploys it only in the experimental context where she has learned of her accuracy. Intuitions about justification here are divided, but at minimum the case undercuts the blanket necessity of awareness.\n\n4.3 Embedded Reasoning in Long Proofs  \nLogical cognition research shows mathematicians often rely on subconscious pattern recognition to navigate proofs, becoming conscious only of partial sketches. If success in these extended reasonings produced merely lucky beliefs, the reliability of advanced mathematics would be miraculous. Better to say that many steps are unconsciously *based* on logical relations the subject could, upon scrutiny, articulate.\n\n4.4 Forgetful Yet Justified  \nSuppose S reads a dozen independent testimonies reporting that vitamin D deficiency correlates with depression. Months later she retains the belief \u201cVitamin D deficiency increases the risk of depression\u201d but forgets the articles. She can still cite \u201cI read credible medical studies\u201d as her general reason. Her belief remains justified because the original evidence continues to *support* it and is owned by S in a persisting, if sketchy, manner. Full recollection is not required.\n\nThese cases suggest the following dilemma for awareness theorists:\n\nEither  \n(a) deny that the highlighted beliefs are justified\u2014a revisionary position at odds with common epistemic practice, or  \n(b) concede that justification can obtain without occurrent or even standing awareness in the strong sense, and thus drop the necessity claim.\n\nMost recent defenders of awareness opt for an attenuated reading: what matters is that the subject is *in principle* able to become aware. But once we move to that territory, a more precise articulation is needed. Enter the Weak-Awareness Account.\n\n\n\n5. The Weak-Awareness Account\n\n5.1 Core Idea  \nJustification requires more than blind causation but less than occurrent consciousness. The intermediate property is *rational accessibility*: the reasons must be available to the subject\u2019s rational powers given normal functioning and modest reflection. Importantly, accessibility is:\n\n\u2013 Personal-level: the information belongs to the subject, not merely to sub-personal circuitry;  \n\u2013 Counterfactual: if S were to reflect, *then* R would become occurrent;  \n\u2013 Non-ideal: the required reflection is limited to abilities S already has.\n\n5.2 Formal Definition  \nAs stated in \u00a71, WA imposes three jointly necessary and sufficient conditions. Some remarks:\n\n(i) Non-deviant causation secures D1 (causal efficacy). We inherit extant accounts of deviance: bypassing, abnormal chain, over-determination, etc.  \n(ii) Rational accessibility secures D2 (epistemic appropriateness). It is *normative*, for it concerns what S *could* bring to conscious consideration, thereby underwriting reflective criticism without demanding permanent introspective vigilance.  \n(iii) Defeater clause guards against cases where S ignores accessible defeaters (say, she could easily notice that the lighting is red). Weak awareness is silent on inaccessible defeaters (deep cognitive biases she could not detect).\n\n5.3 How WA Handles Automatic Cognition  \nConsider modular face recognition. You glance at a colleague and believe \u201cThat is Maria.\u201d Your visual subsystem supplies a match score; you instantly accept. Are you justified? Under WA, yes, because:\n\n\u2013 The matching information causally sustains the belief (i).  \n\u2013 If asked \u201cWhy think that\u2019s Maria?\u201d you could, drawing on the same perceptual uptake and stored biographical knowledge, answer \u201cI just saw her face; that\u2019s what Maria looks like\u201d (ii).  \n\u2013 No salient defeaters intrude (iii).\n\nConscious access was not required *prior* to the question; it sufficed that access could be achieved easily *upon* reflection. Similarly, a modular syntactic parser enables you to believe that \u201cJohn is taller than Mary\u201d implies \u201cMary is shorter than John.\u201d The parser\u2019s internal derivation is not consciously accessible step by step, yet the inference is justified.\n\n5.4 Comparative Advantages  \nWA preserves the intuitive link between justification and responsibility: you retain critical control because you could bring reasons to light. It accommodates animals and infants by allowing *proto-rational accessibility* relative to species-typical capacities. And it respects externalist insights: sub-personal reliability matters, but only when integrated into the subject\u2019s rational economy.\n\n5.5 Relation to Existing Views  \nWA refines John Greco\u2019s \u201cdispositional\u201d approach, Susanna Siegel\u2019s \u201crational linkage\u201d view of perception, and the \u201ctruth-responsiveness\u201d condition in virtue epistemology. Its novelty lies in (a) locating the accessibility threshold at *minimal reflection* (not full articulation), and (b) explicitly combining causal, normative, and defeater-management components in one unified test.\n\n\n\n6. Objections and Replies\n\nObjection 1: The Accessibility Regress  \nSuppose S can become aware of R1 only by inference from R2, and so on. Then either S becomes aware of an infinite chain, impossible, or some link remains unconscious and justification collapses.  \n\nReply: WA\u2019s accessibility is *level-relative*. The chain terminates when S reaches capacities she can deploy non-inferentially (perception, memory, introspection). Because these are epistemic bedrocks, no regress ensues. The structure parallels foundationalism.\n\nObjection 2: The New Evil Demon  \nImagine S is a brain in a vat with experiences indistinguishable from ours. R are merely experiences; they are accessible, yet they do not track the external world. Does WA wrongly count S\u2019s beliefs as justified?  \n\nReply: WA is neutral on *externalist* versus *internalist* factors beyond accessibility. If one wants robust external truth-connection, one can append a reliability clause to (i). WA\u2019s claim concerns awareness, not global epistemic conditions.\n\nObjection 3: Cognitive Penetration and Fake Barns  \nSubjects in epistemically hostile environments may have accessible reasons (it *looks* like a barn) that are systematically misleading. WA seems to license too many false yet \u201cjustified\u201d beliefs.  \n\nReply: Defeater-management in (iii) blocks this worry. If S is aware she is in Fake-Barn County\u2014or could easily recall having been warned\u2014those facts are accessible defeaters. Absent that, common-sense epistemology already grants prima-facie justification to perceptual beliefs; WA aligns with that judgment.\n\nObjection 4: Dormant Capacities  \nWhat if S is an ordinary adult but currently asleep or intoxicated; she *could* not now reflect. Are her retained beliefs still justified?  \n\nReply: Accessibility is defined relative to the agent\u2019s normal waking capacities. Temporary impairment suspends, but does not annihilate, justification: when S sobers up, the beliefs regain their standing. The account thus accommodates the intuition that being drunk excuses but does not permanently discredit one\u2019s beliefs.\n\n\n\n7. Implications and Conclusion\n\nWe began with a stark choice: either uphold an awareness requirement that threatens to delegitimize a swath of ordinary cognition, or embrace a purely externalist account that alienates epistemic agency. The Weak-Awareness Account offers a dialectical coalition. It is *internalist enough* to ground responsibility and defeat-management (via accessibility) yet *externalist enough* to respect the epistemic force of automatic, modular, and unconscious processes (via non-deviant causation).\n\nTwo further payoffs merit notice:\n\nFirst, WA yields a principled taxonomy of epistemic mistakes. Where awareness is absent *and* accessibility fails (e.g., subliminal priming one could not expose by reflection), the resulting belief is *unjustified* though perhaps excusable. Where accessibility holds but defeaters are neglected, the belief is *responsibly criticisable*. This taxonomy illuminates ordinary practices of blame and excuse in the epistemic domain.\n\nSecond, the account suggests a research program: empirically chart the boundary between personal-level accessibility and sub-personal opacity across cognitive domains (perception, language, social cognition). Such work can inform normative epistemology by revealing which cognitive processes are apt to figure in justification.\n\nDoes lack of conscious awareness preclude epistemic basing? No. But neither is awareness irrelevant. What matters is whether the reasons are *weakly accessible*: poised to enter consciousness under the rational control of the subject. On that condition, modular and automatic processes can confer genuine justification, integrating sub-personal efficiency with personal-level responsibility. Epistemic basing, then, is not a spotlight forever trained on our reasons; it is a readiness, within the architecture of the mind, to bring those reasons into view when the demands of inquiry call for them.", "output_tokens": 3501, "reasoning_tokens": 448}

Introduction and Thesis\n\nI will argue that conscious awareness of one\u2019s epistemic reasons is not required for a mental state to be based on those reasons. Conscious access is valuable\u2014it facilitates second-order appraisal, criticism, and communication\u2014but basing itself is fundamentally a first-order relation between a cognitive state and the grounds that rationalize it. The relation can obtain subpersonally, within fast, modular, automatic processes, provided three conditions are met:\n\nA. The process is appropriately reasons-responsive: the content of the mental state covaries in a counterfactual-supporting way with the evidential grounds.  \nB. The process is epistemically proper: it is a reliable competence belonging to the agent, not a deviant or merely accidental cause.  \nC. The agent possesses a weak form of access: the reasons are available to consciousness upon critical reflection, even if they are not tokened in current phenomenal awareness.\n\nI call this picture permissive basing. It preserves the normative force of reasons while acknowledging the empirical reality that most human cognition, including paradigmatic cases of justified belief (e.g., ordinary visual perception), operates automatically and outside the theater of phenomenal attention.\n\nThe paper proceeds in five steps. \u00a72 distinguishes three notions of \u201cawareness\u201d and diagnoses why the strict-awareness thesis (SAT) seems initially attractive. \u00a73 presents four data cases\u2014perceptual belief, expert intuition, implicit statistical reasoning, and non-human animal cognition\u2014that collectively undermine SAT. \u00a74 develops a competence-level account of epistemic basing that accommodates these cases while blocking causal deviance. \u00a75 addresses two principal objections: (i) the agency-responsibility objection that absent consciousness we lose epistemic responsibility, and (ii) the regress objection that weak access collapses into full access. \u00a76 concludes by extracting a broader moral: epistemic normativity supervenes on cognitive architecture rather than phenomenology.\n\n2. Sorting the \u201cAwareness\u201d Family\n\nTalk of being \u201caware of one\u2019s reasons\u201d is ambiguous. I propose three levels:\n\n2.1 Phenomenal Awareness: The decisive presence of the reason\u2019s content in occurrent consciousness with its distinctive \u201cwhat-it-is-likeness.\u201d I see the cup; the visual representation is part of my stream of consciousness.\n\n2.2 Reflective Access: The ability, upon inquiry, to retrieve or articulate the reason. I was not consciously thinking \u201cthe cup is blue,\u201d but if asked I can state it.\n\n2.3 Subpersonal Encoding: Information is represented in the cognitive system and causally efficacious, although the agent may be unable to access it verbally or even introspectively.\n\nStrict-Awareness Thesis (SAT): A belief is epistemically based on R only if R is in phenomenal awareness at the time of belief formation or maintenance.\n\nModerate Awareness Thesis (MAT): A belief is epistemically based on R only if the agent has reflective access to R upon demand.\n\nPermissive Thesis (PT)\u2014my view: Subpersonal encoding suffices for basing provided conditions A\u2013C above hold; phenomenal or even reflective access is not necessary for initial justification, though it becomes relevant for higher-order epistemic tasks (e.g., defending the belief).\n\nWhy might SAT appear plausible? Two motivations dominate the literature.\n\nMotivation 1: Normative Demands. We want believers to be responsible to reasons and capable of epistemic appraisal. If the reasons are unconscious, how can the agent be creditworthy?\n\nMotivation 2: Transparency of Justification. We can ordinarily tell (or think we can tell) why we believe; this suggests awareness is part of the justificatory story.\n\nBoth motivations over-generalize from the special case of reflective evaluation to the generic case of basing, as the following data show.\n\n3. Four Data Cases that Undermine SAT\n\nCase 1: Ordinary Perceptual Belief  \nYou glance at a red wall and believe it is red. The visual representation \u201cred\u201d is indeed phenomenally present. But the justification depends on a hidden battery of low-level computations: edge detection, color constancy corrections, discounting of lighting, etc. None of these are in consciousness, yet they are evidential grounds: remove them (damage area V4, scramble color channels) and the belief collapses. The first-order reason is not the qualia of redness but the nonconscious visual information that stands in causal-rational relations to the belief.\n\nCase 2: Expert Intuition (Chess Grandmaster)  \nA grandmaster looks at a board and immediately foresees that Black\u2019s position is hopeless. She cannot articulate the precise line; nevertheless, her belief is epistemically impressive, not a lucky hunch. Decades of pattern-recognition training encode statistical regularities which act as reasons. If SAT were true, the master\u2019s intuitive judgment would be unjustified until she slows down and verbalizes a six-move combination\u2014contrary to both commonsense and professional practice.\n\nCase 3: Implicit Bayesian Reasoning  \nGigerenzer\u2019s research shows that laypeople become nearly optimal Bayesians when statistical information is phrased in frequency formats. Subjects rarely report conscious application of Bayes\u2019 rule. Their cognitive architecture implicitly computes likelihoods. The resulting beliefs track objective probability and qualify as justified even though the computational reason is inaccessible.\n\nCase 4: Non-Human Animal Cognition  \nBorder collies reliably form the belief that the sheep went behind the barn and will soon emerge on the other side. They represent occlusion and object permanence. Denying that the dog\u2019s belief is epistemically based on perceptual reasons because the dog lacks phenomenology of reasons is implausible\u2014short of species chauvinism one should admit primitive yet genuine epistemic basing without consciousness of reasons.\n\nEach case is a counter-example to SAT but consistent with PT. The agent\u2019s cognitive system is reasons-responsive and competent; the absence of phenomenal awareness does not undermine first-order justification.\n\n4. A Competence-Level Theory of Basing\n\nTo upgrade these case-based intuitions into theory, we need to state when a causal chain qualifies as basing rather than deviance. I borrow from the agency literature the concept of guidance control and adapt it epistemically.\n\nCondition A. Reasons-Responsiveness  \nBelief-forming process \u03a0 is reasons-responsive with respect to proposition p if: for a range of nearby worlds where the reasons R vary, \u03a0 outputs belief in p when R obtains and withholds belief when R is absent. This counterfactual covariation ensures that the process is sensitive to the evidential bearing of R.\n\nCondition B. Epistemic Proper Function (Competence)  \n\u03a0 is a reliable epistemic competence belonging to subject S: it is the kind of process that, in normal environments, produces a high ratio of true to false beliefs. This blocks deviant causal chains (e.g., brain lesions that accidentally cause a true belief) because such chains are not agent-level competences.\n\nCondition C. Weak Accessibility  \nIf S turns her critical attention to why she believes p, the reasons R (or a tractably related subset) are at least in principle retrievable by the coalition of cognitive resources available to S (memory, testimony, further observation). Failure to retrieve may stem from ordinary cognitive limitations, not principled impossibility. C saves the normative insight behind awareness: reasons must be available for potential scrutiny.\n\nNotice that C is weaker than both SAT and MAT: it does not require contemporaneous consciousness or even guaranteed retrieval. It only requires that the reasons are within the agent\u2019s epistemic jurisdiction, not hidden inalienably in the dark corners of subpersonal machinery. Most perceptual, mnemonic, and inferential reasons satisfy weak accessibility.\n\nAdvantages of the Competence-Level View\n\ni. Empirical Adequacy: It accommodates psychological findings that 95% of cognition is unconscious.  \nii. Normative Coherence: It ties justification to competences that we can praise or blame agents for cultivating (e.g., learning to recognize chess patterns).  \niii. Anti-Deviance: By requiring reliable competences and counterfactual sensitivity, it avoids the classic bonkers cases (clairvoyant but irresponsible).  \niv. Integrative: It reconciles internalist intuitions (availability for reflection) with externalist insights (reliability of subpersonal processes).\n\n5. Objections and Replies\n\nObjection 1: The Agency-Responsibility Challenge  \nWithout conscious awareness, agents cannot guide their beliefs and are mere passive spectators. Responsibility for belief presupposes the capacity to take reasons as reasons, which requires awareness.\n\nReply. Guiding cognition has gradations. Even SAT proponents typically allow infants and animals some epistemic standing. My account grounds responsibility not in occurrent phenomenology but in the agent\u2019s ownership of competences. Analogously, we praise a pianist for an improvised riff even if she cannot, in the moment, describe the music theory she is applying. Responsibility traces to the agent\u2019s history of skill acquisition and the modular subroutines that she can, when needed, subject to critical control (condition C). What matters is that the cognitive system is hers, answerable to her evaluative perspective, not that every evidential step floats into consciousness.\n\nObjection 2: The Regress of Availability  \nIf weak accessibility means \u201ccould in principle be brought to consciousness,\u201d SAT proponents will ask: how far in principle? Some subpersonal states (early visual feature detectors) seem permanently inaccessible. Either the regress bottoms out in fully conscious reasons (collapsing into SAT) or it runs indefinitely, undermining normative scrutiny.\n\nReply. The regress misfires once we distinguish personal content from subpersonal vehicles. The justification-conferring reason is not the algorithmic firing of V1 neurons but the representational content they encode (edge, line orientation). That content is accessible: I can, upon reflection, cite my visual experience of the cup\u2019s contour, which\u2014though not specifying V1 operations\u2014suffices as a public-facing reason. Epistemic evaluation targets contentful states at the level of the personal narrative, not every microphysical underpinning. Therefore the regress halts where content becomes stable and reportable, even if the vehicles remain opaque.\n\nObjection 3: The Sellarsian Dilemma  \nWilfrid Sellars argued that for a state to serve as a reason it must stand in the game of giving and asking for reasons, which presupposes linguistic articulation. Subpersonal states are outside the space of reasons.\n\nReply. Sellars\u2019 insight applies to justificatory practices, not fundamentally to basing. The state that plays the internal role of reason need not itself be conceptually articulated; it must merely be capable of entering the game when escorted by suitable expressive resources. Infants\u2019 perceptions already contain proto-conceptual content that later matures into articulable judgments. Thus subpersonal encoding can ground prima facie justification that becomes publicly ratified post hoc.\n\n6. Broader Implications\n\nThe permissive view has three upshots.\n\nFirst, it dissolves a tension between empirically informed philosophy of mind and traditional epistemology. Far from undermining normativity, cognitive science of automatic modules enriches our understanding of the evidential infrastructure underwriting justified belief.\n\nSecond, it advises caution against phenomenological inflation. If we over-identify epistemic standing with conscious awareness, we risk a skeptical slide: only a tiny fraction of our beliefs would emerge justified, collapsing ordinary knowledge.\n\nThird, it reframes epistemic improvement. The path to better belief is not merely introspective vigilance but technological and educational scaffolding that enhances subpersonal competences\u2014e.g., statistical literacy tools that reformat data into frequency formats the brain can effortlessly handle.\n\n7. Conclusion\n\nLack of conscious awareness does not preclude a mental state from being epistemically based on reasons. Basing is secured when (A) a belief-forming process is reasons-responsive, (B) the process is a reliable competence owned by the subject, and (C) the reasons, though not occurrently conscious, are weakly accessible for later scrutiny. This permissive framework vindicates the epistemic legitimacy of modular, automatic cognition without sacrificing the normative aspirations of epistemology. Belief, like skilled action, is often better than we can currently say\u2014justified first, articulated later.", "output_tokens": 2894, "reasoning_tokens": 320}

Orienting the Problem  \n\nEvery epistemic evaluation ultimately concerns the relation between three things: (i) a subject S, (ii) a mental state M (belief, credence, seeming, etc.), and (iii) the grounds, evidence, or reasons R on the basis of which S supposedly holds M.  A belief is justified, on the standard picture, when it is properly based on R.  The question at hand raises a familiar but surprisingly resilient puzzle:  \n\n     Awareness Condition (AC): For S\u2019s belief that p to be epistemically based on reasons R, S must be consciously aware of R (or of their relevance) at the time of forming or sustaining the belief.  \n\nIf AC is true, large swaths of our ordinary epistemic life\u2014perceptual recognition, implicit statistical learning, even many episodes of straightforward deductive reasoning\u2014seem to take place outside the bounds of justification.  The empirical cognitive sciences repeatedly emphasize that our mental economy is shot through with modular, rapid-fire, non-reportable processes.  Does that mean most of our beliefs are epistemically lucky at best, non-rational at worst?  My thesis is a qualified but resolute \u201cno.\u201d  Lack of contemporaneous conscious awareness need not, and typically does not, deprive a mental state of epistemic basing.  What matters is a more modest form of proprietorship over one\u2019s reasons\u2014call it poised accessibility\u2014together with the right counterfactual profile linking R and M.  Conscious awareness is neither necessary nor sufficient for that profile.  \n\nI defend the thesis in four stages.  Section 2 diagnoses the motivations behind AC, distinguishing two strands: responsibility and norm-guidance.  Section 3 marshals empirical and phenomenological evidence showing that AC is too strong.  Section 4 articulates an alternative: the poised-access view, on which basing is a matter of being suitably responsive to reasons in ways that remain within the subject\u2019s rational control even when control is exercisable only diachronically.  Section 5 addresses four prominent objections, including worries about deviant causal chains and epistemic luck.  I close by sketching why the poised-access model reconciles internalist intuitions with externalist insights, and hence offers the best overall synthesis.  \n\n2. Why One Might Think Awareness is Required  \n\n2.1 Responsibility Intuition  \nWe often hold agents epistemically responsible\u2014praise them for careful reasoning, blame them for wishful thinking.  Responsibility seems to presuppose answerability: the agent ought to be able to cite or at least recognize what grounds their belief.  If S cannot do this because R never made an appearance in S\u2019s conscious life, it is tempting to conclude that M cannot be S\u2019s reason-based belief.  \n\n2.2 Norm-Guidance Intuition  \nEpistemic norms, unlike mere causal regularities, are supposed to guide.  \u201cBelieve only what the evidence supports\u201d appears action-guiding only if the agent can attend to the evidence.  A norm one could never heed, because its satisfaction transpires wholly in the dark, looks like mere post-hoc evaluation rather than genuine guidance.  \n\nThese considerations motivate AC but do not yet demonstrate it.  They give us desiderata: basing should connect to responsibility and guidance.  The crucial question is whether conscious awareness is the only mechanism by which that connection can be forged.  I contend it is not.  \n\n3. Against Awareness as a Necessary Condition  \n\n3.1 The Ubiquity of Subpersonal Inference  \nVision is the canonical case.  When I see a mug on the table, my belief that \u201cthere is a mug\u201d is grounded in a cascade of edge detection, stereopsis, colour constancy, and object segmentation\u2014none of which ever surfaces to consciousness.  Still, the perceptual belief is paradigmatically justified.  The proponent of AC might reply that the reason I cite is simply \u201cI see a mug,\u201d and that proposition is consciously available.  But notice: the experiential seeming itself is the deliverance of hidden processes.  If those subpersonal computations failed, e.g. in certain visual agnosias, the phenomenal seeming would not arise and the justification would not accrue.  The epistemically relevant basing relation therefore reaches deeper than what is consciously citable.  \n\n3.2 The Case of Expertise  \nExpert chess players swiftly recognize that a certain configuration threatens mate in three.  Asked why, they frequently appeal to vague terms (\u201cIt just looked dangerous\u201d) and only upon reflection reconstruct a line of play.  Yet the belief is more than a hunch; it tracks the board\u2019s objective features with high reliability.  Unless we are willing to deny that the grandmaster\u2019s belief is justified, we must allow subconscious pattern-recognition as epistemic basing.  \n\n3.3 Implicit Statistical Reasoning  \nHuman beings extrapolate means, variances, and probabilities from small samples remarkably well without being able to articulate the relevant combinatorics.  Suppose I draw a handful of marbles from a large jar and immediately believe with high confidence that most marbles are red.  Laboratory work shows such judgments reflect Bayesian updating implemented by neural populations long before any discursive thought appears.  The justificatory force of the evidence plainly operates even though explicit awareness does not.  \n\n3.4 The Phenomenology of Reflection  \nFinally, introspection itself tends to be post-hoc and confabulatory.  Nisbett and Wilson\u2019s classic studies show subjects fabricating reasons for choices whose real determinants were unconscious.  Imposing AC would perversely imply that the fabricated narratives, not the actual etiology, confer justification\u2014a result bordering on absurdity.  Better to sever the tight link between contemporaneous consciousness and basing.  \n\n4. Poised Accessibility: A Middle Path  \n\nThe challenge is to respect the intuitive pull of responsibility and norm-guidance while accommodating the foregoing data.  I propose the following account.  \n\n     Poised-Access View (PAV): S\u2019s mental state M is epistemically based on reasons R iff  \n     (i) R non-deviantly causes M in a manner that is counterfactually sensitive to variations in R; and  \n     (ii) S possesses the standing capacity to bring R to conscious awareness through minimal reflection, barring abnormal interference.  \n\nClause (i) is standard causal-responsiveness, but with counterfactual sensitivity to rule out deviancies where M is accidentally caused by R.  Clause (ii) introduces poised accessibility: the reasons are \u201cwithin reach\u201d of the person, though not necessarily presently occurrent.  They lie in what Gareth Evans called the \u201cconsciousness fringe\u201d\u2014contents that can be promoted to focal awareness when needed.  \n\n4.1 How PAV Meets Responsibility  \nBecause S can retrieve R upon demand, she is answerable.  A chess master who, when pressed, can articulate lines of play displays this capacity; a split-brain patient whose verbal hemisphere has no access to the visual reason for her manual choice does not.  Responsibility tracks the diachronic possibility of self-citation, not the synchronic presence of explicit citation.  \n\n4.2 How PAV Preserves Norm-Guidance  \nGuidance works via feedback loops: I monitor whether my epistemic habits reliably deliver truth; where they fail, I adjust.  If my subpersonal perceptual module misfires under certain lighting conditions, I can learn to discount those circumstances, precisely because the outputs are poised for scrutiny even if the internals are opaque.  Conscious awareness of the proximal outputs, together with background information, suffices for norm-guided self-correction.  \n\n4.3 Degrees, Not All-or-Nothing  \nPAV suggests basing is graded.  Reasons can be more or less poised.  The less poised, the shakier the justificatory status.  This dovetails with intuitions about implicit bias: snap judgments produced by prejudicial associations are harder to bring under reflective control and hence strike us as less fully justified, even when accidentally true.  The framework thereby accommodates fine-grained normative verdicts.  \n\n5. Four Objections Answered  \n\nObjection 1: Deviant Causal Chains Persist  \nSuppose a clairvoyant\u2019s unfounded belief that the President is in New York happens to be caused by the fact itself (via a psychic link).  PAV\u2019s counterfactual sensitivity clause blocks justification: had the President been elsewhere, the same mysterious faculty would still deliver belief.  R must modulate M across close worlds.  Clairvoyance is insensitive; perception and statistical learning are sensitive.  \n\nObjection 2: Stored Capacities Are Too Thin  \nWhat if S could, with hours of training, articulate R\u2014does that satisfy poised accessibility?  No.  The \u201cminimal reflection\u201d caveat limits discoveries requiring significant new cognitive resources.  Accessibility must be part of S\u2019s existing rational repertoire.  The view thus distinguishes the competent but inarticulate expert from the lucky novice who could only reverse-engineer reasons by enrolling in graduate school.  \n\nObjection 3: The Regress of Accessibility  \nIf basing requires potential access, does access require further access ad infinitum?  No.  The regress halts because retrieving R is an overt act governed by practical, not epistemic, norms.  I need no additional reason to attend to my reasons; I simply can do so, much like shifting my gaze.  The basing relation itself remains at one level.  \n\nObjection 4: AC Better Explains First-Person Authority  \nSome argue that only AC captures the distinctive transparency of self-knowledge: I know why I believe p just by reflecting.  But first-person authority is not infallibility.  People often err about their reasons, precisely because subconscious factors intrude.  PAV predicts this fallibility while preserving enough authority to sustain rational appraisal: sincere reflection usually reveals sufficient grounds unless special factors (fatigue, time pressure) intervene.  \n\n6. Relating PAV to Existing Debates  \n\n6.1 Internalism vs Externalism  \nClassical internalists want reasons \u201cinside the head\u201d and available.  Reliabilists want truth-conducive processes whether or not accessible.  PAV occupies a negotiable middle: the justificatory property supervenes on reliable responsiveness (external) that is poised for potential conscious uptake (internal).  Neither component alone is decisive.  \n\n6.2 Modularity and Epistemic Agency  \nJerry Fodor famously defended modules as informationally encapsulated.  If encapsulation were absolute, no poised accessibility would be possible.  But empirical work reveals partial, graded encapsulation.  Even early vision can be modulated by attention and expectation.  Hence modular outputs are not sealed off from agency; they plug into networks where reflectively controlled weighing of reasons occurs.  \n\n6.3 Affordances for Future Research  \nPAV predicts measurable behavioral correlations: beliefs grounded in more poised reasons should be more resilient under cross-examination yet more revisable when directly rebutted, whereas unpoised beliefs should either crumble or entrench irrationally.  These predictions are testable both in cognitive psychology and in social epistemology (e.g., polarization dynamics).  \n\n7. Conclusion  \n\nDoes lack of conscious awareness of one\u2019s reasons preclude epistemic basing?  No.  Consciousness is neither a gatekeeper of justification nor an epistemic free pass.  The justificatory backbone consists in non-deviant, counterfactually sensitive, reason-responsive processes whose outputs stand ready for reflective endorsement.  Automatic modules, so long as they integrate into this poised architecture, serve as genuine bases for belief.  Awareness is thus demoted from necessary condition to enabling resource\u2014crucial for some functions, dispensable for others.  Recognizing this not only salvages the rationality of ordinary cognition but also clarifies the division of epistemic labour between subpersonal mechanisms and person-level agency.  Far from undermining responsibility or norm-guidance, the picture I have sketched vindicates them on a more realistic, empirically informed footing.", "output_tokens": 2918, "reasoning_tokens": 384}

Setting the Stage  \n\nIn epistemology we ask not only whether a person\u2019s belief is true, but whether she has it for the right reasons.  A paradigm case is the mathematician who believes that 17 is prime because she ran through a proof; her belief is justified in a way that a lucky guess is not.  A central question is therefore the nature of the \u201cbasing relation\u201d: what it is for a mental state S (say, believing that p) to be based on some epistemic reason R (say, the content of a proof of p).\n\nMany philosophers\u2014call them \u201cconscious-reasons internalists\u201d\u2014insist that S can be epistemically based on R only if the subject is consciously aware of R at the moment of basing.  If I cannot bring my reason to mind, the thought goes, it is not my reason.  Other philosophers\u2014often drawing on cognitive science\u2014reply that a great deal of bona-fide reasoning is automatic, modular, or unconscious.  Our perceptual systems integrate evidence from many channels; skilled chess players \u201csee\u201d tactics without being able to articulate them; seasoned radiologists detect tumors in a glance.  Must we deny that such processes confer justification unless the agent could give a moment-by-moment report?\n\nI will argue for a middle position:  \n\nThesis.  Conscious occurrent awareness of one\u2019s reasons is not a necessary condition for epistemic basing.  What is required is that the putative reason be appropriately integrated into the agent\u2019s cognitive architecture so that (i) it causally sustains the target attitude in a non-deviant way, and (ii) the agent has, in principle, diachronic rational access to the reason\u2014access sufficient for critical reflection and rational control, even if no occurrent awareness was present at the moment of inference.\n\nThis \u201cdiachronic accessibility\u201d view rejects the strict conscious-awareness requirement while preserving the intuition that reasons are the subject\u2019s own, not merely happenings in her brain.  I proceed by (A) clarifying key distinctions, (B) presenting the best case for conscious awareness, (C) offering four arguments that awareness is not necessary, (D) developing a positive proposal, and (E) addressing three residual objections.\n\n2. Clarifying Distinctions  \n\n1. Occurrent vs. Dispositional Awareness.  An agent is occurrently aware of R at t if R is then in the focus of her phenomenal attention.  She is dispositionally aware of R if, given suitable prompts (internal reflection, external questioning), she could retrieve R without new evidence.\n\n2. Basing vs. Merely Causal Explanation.  Lightning can cause my lights to flicker, but my belief that there is a storm is not \u201cbased\u201d on the lightning unless the episode functions for me as a reason.  We therefore need a non-deviant causal relation between R and S\u2014roughly, the kind that confers rational guidance.\n\n3. Personal-Level vs. Subpersonal Processing.  Vision science tells us that a cascade of subpersonal computations yields the personal-level percept that there is a cup before me.  An adequate account of basing must explain how subpersonal events can generate personal-level reasons without ipso facto turning every neural spike into a reason.\n\nWith these distinctions, we can ask the core question more precisely: Is occurrent consciousness of R at the personal level necessary for R to non-deviantly cause and rationally sustain S?  Conscious-awareness theorists say yes; I say no.\n\n3. The Best Case for the Consciousness Requirement  \n\nThree influential arguments motivate the requirement.\n\n3.1. The Transparency Argument (Evans, Moran).  When one asks \u201cWhy do I believe p?\u201d, the rational route is to consider the reasons\u2014that is, to look outward, not inward.  If reasons are not present to consciousness, the subject would be opaque to herself, threatening first-person authority.\n\n3.2. The Guidance Argument (McDowell, Boyle).  Epistemically responsible belief involves the agent\u2019s endorsing her commitments.  Endorsement, the claim runs, requires conscious self-representation of the grounds; otherwise the subject is merely pushed around by subpersonal mechanics.\n\n3.3. The Deontic Argument (Feldman, Audi).  Justification is a matter of fulfilling epistemic obligations, and \u201cought\u201d implies \u201ccan.\u201d  One cannot be obliged to base beliefs on reasons that one cannot even notice; therefore conscious access is required.\n\nThese are forceful considerations.  Yet each admits a reply once we look closely at actual cognitive practice.\n\n4. Four Arguments that Conscious Awareness Is Not Necessary  \n\n4.1. The Expertise Argument  \n\nConsider the classic chicken-sexer.  After months handling chicks, she can tell male from female in a second, though she cannot articulate how.  Laboratory work shows that her accuracy far exceeds chance, and that it tracks subtle cues\u2014beak curvature, down patterning\u2014that she cannot put into words.  Intuitively, she has perceptual justification: her belief is based on features of the chick, not lucky hunch.  Occurrent awareness is absent\u2014she looks and \u201cjust knows\u201d\u2014yet basing seems present.  What does the work is a trained perceptual module that reliably hooks up the relevant cues to the belief.\n\nThe same holds for radiologists, grandmaster chess intuitions, and native-speaker grammaticality judgments.  Denying these as cases of basing would make a large portion of our best epistemic practice unjustified.\n\n4.2. The Developmental Argument  \n\nChildren under four can pass non-verbal statistical inference tasks: they predict the color distribution of unseen marbles more accurately than chance.  They cannot, however, formulate the proportions as reasons.  If conscious articulation were required, young children would have no justified beliefs about simple causal relations\u2014an implausible result.\n\n4.3. The Error-Avoidance Argument  \n\nOver-intellectualizing basing invites a \u201cregress of reasons.\u201d  Suppose awareness at t1 is required.  Either the awareness itself involves a belief, in which case we must cite a further awareness at t2, or not, in which case we allow unconscious taking at some level.  At some point, non-conscious rational hooks must be allowed, or infinite regress threatens.  Once we grant them anywhere, the question becomes which ones.  A principled line is needed, and occurrent consciousness is too blunt an instrument.\n\n4.4. The Empirical Plausibility Argument  \n\nWe know from blindsight, neglect, and split-brain studies that a subject can reliably track information unavailable to introspection.  A blindsight patient accurately points to stimuli she denies seeing.  If she forms the belief \u201cthe square is in the upper left,\u201d on what grounds could we deny that the visual stimulus is her epistemic reason?  Doing so would fetishize a contingent fact about phenomenology rather than the rational structure of her cognitive system.\n\n5. A Positive Proposal: Diachronic Accessibility  \n\nThe four arguments suggest that the consciousness requirement is too strong.  Yet the internalist\u2019s core insight is not to be abandoned: reasons must be in some sense available to the subject if she is to be responsible for her beliefs.  Here is the conciliatory proposal.\n\nDiachronic Accessibility Condition (DAC)  \nA mental state S is epistemically based on reason R for subject A iff:\n\n(i) Non-Deviant Causal Production.  R figures in a cognitive process that reliably produces S in virtue of its epistemic content rather than merely causing it by accident (e.g., gas causes hallucination).  \n\n(ii) Potential Rational Endorsement.  Given normal reflective capacities and without acquiring new evidence, A could, when prompted, recognize R as a justifying consideration for S.  This need not be instantaneous\u2014retrieval, reconstruction, or conscious rehearsal may be required\u2014but the information resides in the agent\u2019s cognitive repertoire.\n\n(iii) No Defeating Awareness Blockers.  If A becomes aware that she lacks any idea why she believes p, and that recognition itself defeats her entitlement (e.g., she thinks: \u201cI have no reason; it\u2019s just a hunch\u201d), then S loses justification, even if (i) and (ii) were until that point satisfied.\n\nDAC respects the internalist\u2019s deontic intuition: the agent can, in principle, take ownership of her reasons.  Yet it allows the basing relation to operate through modular, unconscious pipelines.\n\n5.1. How the Chicken-Sexer Satisfies DAC  \n\nThe relevant cues (down pattern, beak shape) causally produce the belief in a reliable, training-mediated process (i).  If our sexer is questioned, she cannot articulate the micro-features but she can gesture toward them: \u201cThere\u2019s something about the feel of the down\u2026 the shape of the beak.\u201d  With practice or slowing the task, she can often bring the cues to consciousness (ii).  There is no blocking self-defeat (iii).  Hence her belief is justified.\n\n5.2. Relation to Williamson\u2019s Knowledge-First and Reliabilism  \n\nDAC preserves the reliabilist\u2019s link to truth: (i) requires that the content of R figures in a reliable production of S.  But it weaves in an internalist layer: (ii) demands potential accessibility.  Thus it answers the worry that pure reliabilism makes justification too \u201cexternal.\u201d  At the same time, it avoids the objection to strict internalism that unconscious but reliable cognition would be epistemically blind.\n\n6. Objections and Replies  \n\nObjection 1: The Deviant Casual Chain Worry  \nSuppose a subject has a suppressed memory of a newspaper headline \u201cStocks will crash.\u201d  Years later she forms the belief \u201cStocks will crash today\u201d due to an anxiety attack triggered by atmospheric pressure that also reactivates the buried memory.  She could retrieve the memory in therapy (so (ii) seems met), yet we would not say her belief is justified.  Isn\u2019t DAC too permissive?\n\nReply: Condition (i) requires non-deviant causation in virtue of content.  In the case described, the buried memory is not functioning as a reason; atmospheric pressure, not epistemic content, is driving the belief.  DAC therefore withholds justification.\n\nObjection 2: The Epistemic Luck Challenge  \nEven if DAC secures potential rational endorsement, the lack of occurrent awareness means the agent could not have reflected before acting.  Doesn\u2019t that leave her hostage to luck at the time of decision?\n\nReply: Agents often act on automatic processes (driving a familiar route) where reflection would degrade performance.  What matters for justification is that the process is reliable and that the agent retains rational control in principle\u2014she could slow down, check mirrors, and explain her route if needed.  DAC mirrors this diachronic, context-sensitive control.\n\nObjection 3: The Zombie-Twin Scenario  \nImagine a physically identical zombie who lacks consciousness.  According to DAC, the zombie satisfies (i) and (ii) (she processes information, could produce verbal reports) but not (because she lacks phenomenal states) occurrent or even potential conscious endorsement.  Does DAC imply that the zombie\u2019s beliefs are justified?  If so, have we not abandoned internalism entirely?\n\nReply: Two points.  First, (ii) involves the modal \u201ccould recognize\u201d inside the cognitive life of the agent.  If genuine zombies are metaphysically possible, they lack the capacity for recognizing a consideration as a reason.  They can spit out data, but \u201ctaking\u201d something as a reason arguably requires minimal phenomenal or self-representational awareness.  So a zombie fails (ii).  Second, if one thinks zombies do have that capacity, the divergence shows that the dispute is about consciousness\u2019s role in rational endorsement, not about occurrent awareness per se.  DAC is neutral on the metaphysics of consciousness; it simply says: whatever capacities underwrite rational endorsement, occurrent awareness is unnecessary.\n\n7. A Novel Illustration: The Somnambulist Scientist  \n\nConsider Dr. Somnus, who occasionally sleep-walks.  One night, in the lab, Somnus solves a complex statistical problem on a whiteboard while fast asleep.  In the morning he reads the solution\u2014recognizing his own handwriting, he forms the belief that the proof is sound.  He does not consciously remember producing it.  Is his belief justified?\n\nTraditional views face a dilemma: if conscious awareness at the time of inference is required, justification fails; if any causal production suffices, we risk counting lucky scribbles as justified.  DAC delivers a nuanced verdict.  The proof itself now functions as Somnus\u2019s reason.  He can scrutinize it, walk through each step, and endorse it.  So the belief formed in the morning is justified.  The sleep-walking performance was a causally enabling stage, not the basing event.  The case thus separates temporal production from epistemic basing, vindicating the diachronic dimension.\n\n8. Consequences and Further Research  \n\nAccepting DAC has several upshots:\n\n1. Cognitive Science Friendly Epistemology.  It aligns philosophical accounts with empirical work on dual-process cognition: System-1 fast heuristics can justify when integrated with System-2 oversight.\n\n2. New Space for Virtue Epistemology.  Skills\u2014perceptual, moral, practical\u2014look more like intellectual virtues when we drop the consciousness strait-jacket; what matters is reliable, responsibly trainable responsiveness to reasons.\n\n3. Reconciling Pragmatism and Internalism.  On DAC, habits can be reason-sensitive without being reflectively deployed each time, echoing Peircean and Deweyan themes about inquiry as socially distributed over time.\n\n9. Conclusion  \n\nLack of occurrent conscious awareness does not, by itself, preclude a mental state from being epistemically based on reasons.  What matters is a diachronic nexus: reliable content-driven causation plus the agent\u2019s standing capacity to recognize and endorse the reason when the context demands.  This view preserves the internalist insight that reasons must be one\u2019s own, while respecting the cognitive-scientific fact that much of our best reasoning is rapid, automatic, and unconscious.  A mature epistemology should make room for both the radiologist\u2019s split-second diagnosis and the philosopher\u2019s slow deliberations\u2014each, in its way, a rational creature sensitive to the force of reasons.", "output_tokens": 3410, "reasoning_tokens": 384}

Introduction: From the Slogan to the Puzzle\n\nArthur Fine once quipped that calling a result \u201cobjective\u201d is just shorthand for saying \u201cyou can trust it.\u201d Heather Douglas echoes the thought, writing that objectivity \u201cearns public trust.\u201d  At first pass the gloss is appealing: when we worry about bias in climate models, pharmaceutical trials, or forensic labs, what we really want to know is whether to trust the outputs.  But the slogan leaves us with two immediate puzzles.\n\nFirst, \u201ctrust\u201d is itself polysemous.  I may trust my dog to greet me at the door, my bank to keep my money safe, my fellow driver to stay in her lane, and my graduate student to carry out an experiment.  These rely on different grounds (predictability, contractual obligation, shared norms, demonstrated competence) and differ in their normative structure.  Saying that objectivity = trust threatens to collapse all that complexity.\n\nSecond, the major senses of objectivity usually distinguished in philosophy of science\u2014procedural, convergent, and interactive\u2014sound like different animals.  Procedural objectivity concerns standardized methods that suppress individual idiosyncrasies (e.g., using a calibrated thermometer rather than a fingertip to measure temperature).  Convergent objectivity looks to agreement across independent lines of evidence (e.g., evolutionary trees reconstructed from both morphology and DNA).  Interactive objectivity highlights critical social mechanisms\u2014peer review, workshops, adversarial collaborations\u2014through which communities detect and weed out error.  Why should these heterogeneous practices be unified under one concept at all?\n\nI will defend three theses.\n\n1. The root phenomenon that unifies the various senses of objectivity is not trust per se but a more basic property I call counterfactual resilience: the result would remain stably true across a range of plausible variations in the epistemic situation.\n2. Trust is a rational second-order response to perceived counterfactual resilience; it is an effect, not the essence, of objectivity.\n3. Procedural, convergent, and interactive objectivity are three design strategies for manufacturing counterfactual resilience by addressing distinct vulnerability classes\u2014idiosyncrasy, underdetermination, and bias\u2014within a cooperative division of cognitive labor.\n\nClarifying the architecture of objectivity in this way sharpens the notion of trust, explains why disparate senses of objectivity hang together, and illuminates both successes and failures of science.\n\n2. What Kind of Trust Is at Issue?\n\nPhilosophers of testimony distinguish at least two attitudes that may travel under the heading \u201ctrust\u201d:\n\nA. Reliance: I predict that you (or your instrument) will behave in a certain way and plan my actions accordingly.  \nB. Entrustment: I am entitled to hold you accountable if you fail; you owe me epistemic diligence.\n\nReliance is largely pragmatic; entrustment is normative.  When we ask whether a reported p-value of 0.03 is objective, we care about both: we want to be able to rely on that number for further reasoning, and we want the authors to have met obligations of good scientific practice.  Both kinds of trust are downstream of judgments about trustworthiness, which itself must be grounded in some observable property.\n\nHence Fine and Douglas have hold of an important insight: objectivity functions as a guarantor that renders epistemic dependence reasonable.  But equating objectivity with trust blurs the direction of dependence.  Trust is the attitude of the consumer; objectivity names design features of the product.  A more precise analysis therefore reverses the explanatory order: because (and only when) certain design features are in place, the consumer is rationally entitled to trust.\n\n3. Counterfactual Resilience: A Common Core\n\nLet us introduce a notion meant to capture what those design features deliver.\n\nCounterfactual Resilience (CR): An epistemic product (a measurement, a theory, a dataset) is counterfactually resilient to the extent that it would survive truth-preserving across a space of relevant counterfactual perturbations in the processes that produced it.\n\nPerturbations include:\n\u2022 Different competent practitioners (variation of agents).  \n\u2022 Different but appropriate measurement devices (instrumental variation).  \n\u2022 Different but evidentially connected pathways (methodological variation).  \n\u2022 Critical scrutiny, attempted replication, and disclosure of underlying data (social variation).\n\nCR is not truth.  A claim could be true by luck yet fragile.  Nor is CR certainty.  Rather it is a modal robustness property: the claim\u2019s truth is insensitive to a class of foreseeable, normatively relevant changes.  Why choose this property as the unifier?  Because each form of objectivity can be interpreted as constructing or revealing CR along one dimension.\n\n4. Three Strategies for Manufacturing Counterfactual Resilience\n\n4.1 Procedural Objectivity: Neutralizing Idiosyncrasy\n\nParadigm case: a blood-glucose test performed with an automated spectrophotometer following a published protocol.\n\nDesign problem: individual observers are noisy, biased, context-sensitive.\n\nSolution: impose standard operating procedures (SOPs), calibration criteria, and algorithmic decision rules that strip the result of dependence on any particular person\u2019s quirks.\n\nModal upshot: had a different competent technician followed the same SOPs with the same equipment class, the reading would have been the same within tolerance.  Thus CR across agent-counterfactuals.\n\n4.2 Convergent Objectivity: Multiplying Independent Support\n\nParadigm case: the atomic weight of carbon determined by mass spectroscopy, combustion analysis, and X-ray diffraction.\n\nDesign problem: any single evidential line may harbor systematic error or model underdetermination.\n\nSolution: look for agreement among methodologies whose error structures are uncorrelated.  When independent lines converge, the hypothesis is no longer hostage to the peculiarities of any one method.\n\nModal upshot: had we used only method M1, we might still have obtained the same value, but we would not know whether that was accidental.  Convergence shows that if M1 were subtly off yet M2,M3 intact, the consensus would resist the perturbation.  CR across methodology-counterfactuals.\n\n4.3 Interactive Objectivity: Harnessing Organized Critique\n\nParadigm case: adversarial collaborations in social psychology where teams with opposing theoretical commitments jointly design studies whose outcomes both agree to accept.\n\nDesign problem: background assumptions and value judgments infiltrate theory choice; groupthink and confirmation bias lurk.\n\nSolution: create social architectures\u2014peer review, open data mandates, \u201cjournal clubs,\u201d statistical re-analyses\u2014where motivated opponents can probe weaknesses.  What survives hostile scrutiny enjoys a robustness earned through contestation.\n\nModal upshot: if hidden bias B were operative, critics with incentives to expose B would likely have found it.  The result is resilient across social-critical-counterfactuals.\n\n5. Making the Connection to Trust\n\nWhy does CR rationally license trust?\n\nFirst, reliance: a user who lacks time, resources, or expertise to replicate the experiment personally can nevertheless project that, had the process been run slightly differently, the result would hold.  That justifies acting on it.\n\nSecond, entrustment: CR-producing institutions internalize accountability mechanisms.  When protocols, replication archives, and open reviews are in place, producers owe the community transparency; breach of such norms is detectably sanctionable.  Hence entrustment is not blind faith but is anchored in an enforceable social contract.\n\nNotice that CR is necessary but not sufficient for trust.  Historical pathologies\u2014tobacco industry-funded \u201cresearch,\u201d certain forensic techniques\u2014achieved a veneer of procedural objectivity yet manipulated the evidential space so that relevant counterfactuals (e.g., independent replication by unaffiliated labs) were blocked.  Where the modal space is truncated, rational trust should be withheld.  The account thus diagnoses both well-founded trust and its counterfeit.\n\n6. Objections and Replies\n\nObjection 1: Some sciences (e.g., historical cosmology) cannot satisfy convergence or replication but are still regarded as objective.\n\nReply: The modal space must be tailored to field-specific constraints.  For Big Bang nucleosynthesis, CR is achieved through consilience among relic signatures: light-element abundances, CMB anisotropies, Hubble expansion.  These constitute functional analogues of replication even if the universe cannot be rerun.  What matters is resilience across methodologically uncorrelated evidence, not literal reproduction.\n\nObjection 2: Objectivity is a partisan ideal that masks power relations; oppressed groups may rationally refuse trust even when CR seems high (feminist and decolonial critiques).\n\nReply: Power critiques underscore that the modal space must include variations in standpoint.  If procedures systematically silence certain perspectives, then relevant counterfactuals (what the result would be if marginalized knowers had participated) are ignored, so true objectivity has not been achieved.  Our model is hospitable to standpoint insights because it treats inclusion as instrumentally necessary for maximal CR.\n\nObjection 3: Machine learning systems can exhibit predictive accuracy yet be non-objective in the traditional senses; where do they fit?\n\nReply: High predictive accuracy on a held-out dataset witnesses some CR (across data-subsample perturbations) but leaves open algorithmic opacity, spurious correlations, and social feedback loops.  Recent proposals for \u201cexplainable AI,\u201d auditing, and post-deployment monitoring can be interpreted as attempts to extend CR across transparency-, bias-, and interaction-counterfactuals.  The framework thus offers guidance for AI governance.\n\n7. Precision, Scope, and Distinctions\n\nThe present account hinges on three distinctions often muddled in the literature.\n\n1. Trust vs. Trustworthiness: the attitude of the consumer vs. the property of the product.  \n2. Reliability vs. Resilience: frequency of success in the actual world vs. stability across relevant nearby worlds.  \n3. Individual vs. Distributed Epistemology: objectivity as a personal virtue (Descartes\u2019 clear and distinct ideas) vs. objectivity as a property of collective mechanisms.  \n\nSituating objectivity at the level of distributed resilience clarifies why modern science needs elaborate institutions rather than heroic intellectual virtue alone.\n\n8. A Programmatic Payoff: Metrics of Objectivity\n\nIf the analysis is correct, scientists and policymakers can operationalize objectivity by asking three modal questions.\n\nQ1. Agentic Variation: Would equally competent but differently trained investigators obtain the same result?  (Procedural audits)  \nQ2. Methodological Variation: Would alternative, independently calibrated techniques support the claim?  (Triangulation and multimodal evidence)  \nQ3. Critical Variation: Would informed adversaries be able and motivated to expose hidden flaws?  (Transparency, open data, adversarial review)\n\nA positive answer to all three is a defeasible warrant for trust.  Quantitative proxies\u2014inter-laboratory standard deviations, Bayes factors synthesizing multiple datasets, citation diversity indices\u2014could index the degree of CR, enabling comparative assessments of objectivity across fields.\n\n9. Comparative Evaluation with Existing Accounts\n\nHow does this proposal relate to classic analyses?\n\n\u2022 Reichenbach tied objectivity to the \u201ccontext of justification\u201d stripped of contingent psychology.  Our model retains that aspiration but embeds it in a richer modal space.  \n\u2022 Longino emphasized \u201ctransformative criticism.\u201d  That is subsumed under the critical-variation dimension, clarifying why interaction is necessary but not sufficient: without procedural discipline the critical exchange degenerates into polemic; without multiple evidence streams criticism may stall in underdetermination.  \n\u2022 Fine\u2019s \u201cNOA\u201d (Natural Ontological Attitude) dissolves realism debates by urging trust in science \u201cwarts and all.\u201d  We sharpen NOA\u2019s key term: trust is rational only to the extent CR is established; warts tolerated must not include modal fragility.\n\n10. Conclusion: Re-centring Objectivity on Resilience, Not Reassurance\n\nThe temptation to collapse objectivity into trust mistakes the psychological endpoint for the epistemic engine.  Scientific objectivity is best understood as a multilayered architecture for constructing counterfactual resilience\u2014robustness against variations in agent, method, and critical environment.  When that architecture functions as intended, the rational response is trust; when it malfunctions, trust is misplaced.  Unifying the procedural, convergent, and interactive senses under the banner of resilience not only clarifies their kinship but also offers concrete guidance for improving scientific practice and for adjudicating public controversies where the legitimacy of expertise is contested.\n\nRoughly two centuries ago, John Herschel urged scientists to \u201csecure ourselves, as far as possible, against all sources of error.\u201d  Counterfactual resilience gives precise voice to that aspiration.  It explains both why we are so often entitled to lean on the sciences\u2014and why we must remain vigilant about the modal spaces in which their claims live.  Trust, in the end, is not the definition of objectivity; it is its earned reward.", "output_tokens": 3235, "reasoning_tokens": 512}

Philosophers distinguish reliance, faith, and norm-governed trust; these come apart in ways that matter to science.\n\n(2) Is objectivity merely whatever evokes that trust, or does it possess a more determinate structure that rationally warrants trust?\n\nMy thesis is two-fold.\n\nA.\u2002Scientific objectivity is best understood, across its many advertised \u201csenses,\u201d as perspective-invariant warrant: a product, method, or judgment is objective to the extent that it would remain robustly stable under a wide range of counterfactual variations in individual perspective, background commitments, and local error sources.\n\nB.\u2002Because perspective-invariance supplies non-idiosyncratic reasons, it is precisely the feature that renders epistemic trust\u2014understood normatively as justified confidence that others will meet certain standards\u2014reasonable.  Trust is therefore not the basis of objectivity; rather, objectivity is the basis of warranted trust.  The relation is asymmetric: we *trust because* something is objective; calling it objective is shorthand for reporting the possession of this elaborate, counterfactually robust warrant.\n\nBy explicating (A) we can show why the standard taxonomies of objectivity\u2014procedural, concordant, interactive\u2014are not disjoint senses but complementary strategies for achieving perspective-invariance.  By situating (B) within an explicit philosophy of trust, we gain the precision Fine and Douglas seek.\n\nThe argument proceeds in four stages.  Section 2 disentangles varieties of trust and surveys the disparate \u201ckinds\u201d of objectivity.  Section 3 diagnoses the inadequacy of the simple Trust-Equals-Objectivity equation.  Section 4 develops the perspective-invariance account and shows how each familiar sense of objectivity instantiates it.  Section 5 addresses three major objections.  A brief conclusion highlights implications for debates over replication, expert authority, and social values in science.\n\n2.\u2003Clarifying the Terrain\n\n2.1\u2003Trust versus Mere Reliance\n\nPhilosophers of action note that I *rely* on my alarm clock but I do not *trust* it in a normative sense; if it fails, I replace it without resentment.  Trust, as Russell Hardin and Karen Jones emphasize, involves a *normative expectation*: I take you to have *undertaken* certain responsibilities and I feel entitled to criticism if you betray them.  Trust therefore has a second-personal structure (Stephen Darwall): it is grounded in interpersonal accountability.\n\nScientific communication works the same way.  When a particle physicist cites ATLAS data, she is not merely relying on a widget; she is conferring authority on a community that has pledged adherence to collectively recognized standards\u2014statistical blindness, calibration protocols, transparent data release.  Her expectation is not \u201cthe detector probably works\u201d but \u201cif something went wrong, they were obligated to detect and disclose it, and I can hold them answerable.\u201d\n\n2.2\u2003The Many Faces of Objectivity\n\nFollowing Ian Hacking, Heather Douglas, and Lorraine Daston & Peter Galison, philosophers list at least five \u201csenses\u201d of objectivity:\n\n(i) Procedural (or rule-following) objectivity: standardized, replicable methods (blind trials, double coding, ASTM material tests).\n\n(ii) Convergent (or concordant) objectivity: independent lines of evidence that converge on the same quantity or theory (Avogadro\u2019s number, the Hubble constant).\n\n(iii) Interactive objectivity: structured critical exchange that expunges the influence of individual biases (peer review, adversarial collaboration).\n\n(iv) Ontic objectivity: mind-independent features of the world (John Searle\u2019s boulders and quarks).\n\n(v) Measurement or structural objectivity: invariant mathematical structures underlying phenomena (tensor equations of General Relativity).\n\nThese catalogues make it tempting to speak, with Douglas, of a \u201cpatchwork.\u201d  Yet scientists do not treat objectivity as a grab-bag; they move fluidly among these idioms, confident that something common animates them.\n\n3.\u2003Why \u201cObjectivity = Trust\u201d Is Too Thin\n\nConsider three cases.\n\nCase 1: A charismatic guru publishes a health study in which every step is concealed.  Millions, however, *trust* her.  By Fine\u2019s gloss the study is objective.  Intuition rebels.\n\nCase 2: An automated sensor network in Antarctica records atmospheric CO\u2082 in real time.  No one has yet looked at the data, so there is no actual trust.  But the set-up is procedurally impeccable and would satisfy any auditor.  Most philosophers would call the record objective already.\n\nCase 3: In the early days of gravitational-wave astronomy, LIGO physicists openly worried about \u201cblinding injections.\u201d  They trusted no single dataset but trusted the *system* precisely because they had built in falsification tests.  Here trust and objectivity evolve together, neither reducible to the other.\n\nThese vignettes demonstrate: (1) trust can exist without objectivity, (2) objectivity can exist without current trust, and (3) the mature scientific situation embeds a rational interplay rather than identity.\n\n4.\u2003Perspective-Invariance as the Unifying Core\n\n4.1\u2003Why Perspective-Invariance?\n\nStart with an elementary thought: whenever scientists complain that a result is \u201csubjective,\u201d they mean it depends on factors that should have been eliminable\u2014wishful thinking, ideological commitments, instrument drift, or lab-specific coding tricks.  When they applaud \u201cobjectivity,\u201d they celebrate the removal or neutralization of those dependencies.  In modal terms, an objective result is *counterfactually stable*: vary the individual inquirer, vary her cultural loyalties, vary the specific sample, and\u2014within a domain-appropriate range\u2014the result stands.\n\nCall this property perspective-invariance (PI).  PI is obviously gradational: some results survive only minor perturbations, others survive sweeping changes.  But crucially, PI is *publicly testable*.  You can show that a blood test\u2019s outcome is not lab-specific by shipping calibrated samples to twenty independent facilities; you can show climate signal robustness by running diverse models on distinct temperature proxies; you can show freedom from value bias by inviting critics to rerun the analysis with alternative assumptions.\n\nBecause PI admits empirical demonstration, it furnishes exactly the sort of reason that warrants second-personal normative trust.  Observers are entitled to expect that the producers will uphold their obligations\u2014\u201cIf counterfactual perspectives revealed an instability, you would have been bound to find and fix it.\u201d\n\n4.2\u2003The Taxonomy Unified\n\n(i) Procedural objectivity secures PI by enforcing *ex ante* sameness of operations across persons.  Double-blind randomization makes where-and-who differences counterfactually irrelevant.\n\n(ii) Convergent objectivity secures PI \u201cfrom above\u201d: instead of homogenizing procedures, it employs heterogeneous routes that nonetheless converge.  If X-ray diffraction and cryo-EM yield the same protein structure, then even drastic method variance leaves the result intact.\n\n(iii) Interactive objectivity secures PI \u201cfrom within the social scene\u201d: regulated contestation ensures that *idiosyncratic cognitive biases* cancel.  Adversarial collaborations in social psychology, or shared code repositories subject to pull-requests, render personal perspective swings electorally insignificant.\n\n(iv) Ontic objectivity is the metaphysical basement: the world\u2019s own structure is, by hypothesis, not hostage to any perspective.  But scientists access this only via (i)\u2013(iii).  Thus ontic objectivity functions as the *telos* that the operational strategies approximate.\n\n(v) Structural or measurement objectivity expresses PI in a mathematical idiom: tensor equations retain form under coordinate transformations; measurement standards define units invariant under local environmental variation.\n\nWhat looked like a patchwork now appears as a tool-kit oriented toward a single regulative ideal: making results robust against counterfactual perspective shifts.\n\n4.3\u2003Why PI Grounds Rational Trust\n\nTo *trust* someone scientifically is to believe they have met a norm: \u201cDo not let contingent personal or situational quirks dictate the result.\u201d  PI is exactly the satisfaction-condition of that norm.  Moreover, the publicly demonstrable nature of PI allows third parties (journal editors, grant managers, policymakers, students) to monitor compliance without duplicating every experiment themselves.  Trust rides on *warranted* deference.\n\nNote the asymmetry: objectivity (PI) justifies trust; it is logically prior.  Of course, the social fact of trust may *motivate* the search for objectivity\u2014no scientist enjoys being distrusted.  But the epistemic standing runs from objectivity to trust, not vice-versa.\n\n5.\u2003Objections and Replies\n\nObjection 1: Perspective-invariance is too demanding; some disciplines (e.g., historical geology) cannot reproduce experiments or vary observers widely.\n\nReply: PI is domain-relative.  The relevant counterfactuals are those *reasonable* within the field.  A historical geologist cannot rerun the Chicxulub impact, but she can cross-check sediment cores obtained by different ships, isotopic labs, and interpretive teams.  PI requires comparative stability across *available* perspective shifts, not metaphysically maximal ones.\n\nObjection 2: Standpoint epistemologies argue that marginalized perspectives *add* knowledge; thus eliminating perspective collapses important insight.\n\nReply: PI does not presuppose a view from nowhere.  On the contrary, it relies on *multiplying* perspectives to test for invariance.  The inclusion of women in medical trials or Indigenous observers in ecological surveying often reveals previously unnoticed variance\u2014i.e., failures of PI.  The aim is not to erase standpoints but to ensure that the *product* no longer pivots on any single one.\n\nObjection 3: The replication crisis shows that procedural objectivity (pre-registration, randomization) was insufficient; so PI collapses when the social will to replicate wanes.\n\nReply: The crisis is precisely a demonstration of the PI framework.  Early claims lacked robustness across labs and analytic pipelines\u2014they were, ex post, perspective-dependent.  Contemporary solutions\u2014registered reports, multi-lab replications, open data\u2014are straightforward attempts to augment PI and thereby restore justified trust.\n\n6.\u2003Payoffs and Further Avenues\n\nReconceiving objectivity as perspective-invariant warrant yields several dividends.\n\n1. Diagnosing controversies: Debates over \u201cmodel pluralism\u201d in climate science or \u201csubconscious bias\u201d in AI datasets become questions about the *range* of perspectives that must be canvassed to achieve sufficient invariance for the intended use.\n\n2. Policy guidance: Agencies that fund science can, instead of exhorting \u201cBe objective!\u201d, specify procedures that demonstrably enhance PI\u2014e.g., mandatory adversarial audits for high-stakes studies.\n\n3. Ethical insight: Because trust is norm-governed, breaches of PI are morally culpable: they violate the implicit social contract of scientific communication.  A falsified image is not only unreliable but a betrayal of warranted inter-personal expectations.\n\n7.\u2003Conclusion\n\nObjectivity and trust are intimately linked, but not in the lax sense that whatever we trust counts as objective.  The link is mediated by perspective-invariance: the property of results, methods, or claims that renders them robust under a domain-appropriate range of counterfactual variations in individual perspective, background assumptions, and local contingencies.  Procedural rules, convergent evidence, interactive critique, and structural invariance are diverse engineering solutions to the single design problem of achieving PI.  Once obtained and publicly certified, PI supplies precisely the non-idiosyncratic reasons that make normative, second-personal trust rational.  Understood this way, Fine\u2019s slogan is rehabilitated: calling something objective is indeed a way of saying \u201cyou can trust it\u201d\u2014but the saying is not magic; it is elliptical for the rich claim that perspective-invariance has been demonstrably secured.\n\nFuture work might quantify degrees of PI (network-theoretic measures of methodological independence), explore its limits in radically underdetermined fields (cosmology), or examine its moral psychology (how do lay publics recognize PI cues?).

Introduction: why the \u201ctrust-based\u201d slogan is attractive but vague  \n\nWhen Arthur Fine says that to call a result \u201cobjective\u201d is \u201csimply to say we can trust it,\u201d and when Heather Douglas claims that \u201cobjectivity is a form of trustworthiness,\u201d they capture an important datum: appeals to objectivity do social work. They license the reliance of others\u2014scientists in neighboring fields, policymakers, lay citizens\u2014on claims they have not personally verified.  But the slogan is too thin to explain either (i) why some practices deserve the label \u201cobjective\u201d while others do not, or (ii) why several apparently heterogeneous senses of objectivity (procedural, convergent, interactive, etc.) are recognizable as species of the same genus.  My aim is to refine the relationship.  I argue:\n\nThesis\u2003Scientific objectivity is best understood as the systematic management of epistemic vulnerability.  Practices count as \u201cobjective\u201d to the extent that they make a claim resilient to the major ways it could have gone wrong\u2014idiosyncrasy, interference, or opacity.  \u201cTrust\u201d is not itself the unifying property; it is the second-personal attitude rationally triggered when these vulnerability-reducing mechanisms are in place.  What unifies the different senses of objectivity is that each is a strategy for reducing one of the three vulnerability dimensions.\n\nThis proposal secures five benefits.  (1) It clarifies why \u201cobjectivity\u201d and \u201ctrust\u201d are intimately linked yet distinct.  (2) It yields a principled taxonomy of procedural, convergent, and interactive objectivity without merely listing them.  (3) It explains why calls for objectivity are louder precisely in situations of high epistemic vulnerability (clinical trials, climate models, forensic labs).  (4) It makes sense of both individual and social faces of objectivity.  (5) It accommodates feminist and post-Kuhnian worries about value-laden science: objectivity is not value-freedom but disciplined vulnerability-reduction.\n\nI proceed as follows.  Section 2 disentangles trust, reliance, and trustworthiness.  Section 3 sketches the three vulnerability dimensions.  Section 4 shows how the familiar forms of objectivity track them.  Section 5 assesses Fine\u2019s and Douglas\u2019s proposals in light of the account.  Section 6 anticipates objections.  Section 7 highlights implications.\n\n2. Trust, reliance, and trustworthiness  \n\nTalk of \u201ctrust\u201d in everyday discourse slides between three ideas:  \n\na. Reliance: the mere fact that my plans incorporate your action.  \nb. Trust as an attitude: I rely and I expect goodwill or competence, often incurring vulnerability.  \nc. Trustworthiness: the property of being worthy of that trust.\n\nObjectivity is sometimes equated with (b), but that mislocates it.  It is not an attitude but a set of properties of a claim or process\u2014hence if it belongs anywhere, it aligns with (c).  Yet even this is crude: there are many routes to trustworthiness (good character, divine guarantee, luck) that have nothing to do with objectivity.  We therefore need a thinner notion: objective trustworthiness is trustworthiness secured non-accidentally through publicly inspectable epistemic safeguards.  \n\nHence: Objectivity \u2192 warranted reliance without personal acquaintance with the agent(s) or direct inspection of the phenomenon.  The mechanism is institutional rather than interpersonal.\n\n3. Epistemic vulnerability: three dimensions  \n\nWhy do we sometimes feel safe relying on a stranger\u2019s scientific claim while hesitating over, say, a horoscope?  Because the former has traveled a gauntlet of checks designed to block the principal failure modes.  Drawing on work in risk theory (Douglas 2009), social epistemology (Hardwig 1985; Longino 1990), and recent philosophy of science, we can itemize three broad vulnerability dimensions:\n\n1. Idiosyncrasy Risk: the risk that the result reflects the quirks, errors, cognitive biases, or local conditions of a particular observer.  \n2. Interference Risk: the risk that non-epistemic influences (career pressure, political values, industrial funding) have steered the result.  \n3. Opacity Risk: the risk that the grounds of the claim are hidden or incomprehensible to relevant others, preventing detection of mistakes or misconduct.\n\nThe core function of objectivity is to reduce these risks to an acceptably low level\u2014\u201cacceptably\u201d being context-relative and often negotiated.\n\n4. Mapping the canonical senses of objectivity onto vulnerability reduction  \n\n4.1 Procedural objectivity \u2192 taming idiosyncrasy  \n\nKey idea: If any competent practitioner following a protocol would obtain the same result, then idiosyncrasy risk is minimized.  We bake standards into machines, statistical recipes, blind assessment, shared vocabularies.  Daston and Galison\u2019s \u201cmechanical objectivity\u201d in 19th-century atlases exemplifies this impulse.\n\nExample: The double-blind randomized clinical trial.  Randomization blocks selection bias; double-blinding blocks expectancy and observer effects.  Even an inept or malicious clinician cannot (easily) skew the outcome.  Hence others may trust the published efficacy rate without meeting the investigators.\n\n4.2 Convergent objectivity \u2192 taming interference  \n\nFine\u2019s \u201cconvergent\u201d notion arises when multiple, independent lines of evidence point to the same entity or parameter value (e.g., Planck\u2019s constant).  Convergence matters because the interfering factors that might skew one line are unlikely to coincide across heterogeneous methods.  Nancy Cartwright calls this \u201crobustness.\u201d  It is a version of triangulation: when different paths agree, we downgrade the probability that a shared bias explains the agreement.\n\nExample: The mass of the Higgs boson was not accepted until data from two detectors (ATLAS and CMS) converged.  Each team faced different funding streams, instrumentation quirks, and analysis algorithms.  Convergence mitigated suspicion that any single pressure, political or methodological, drove the signal.\n\n4.3 Interactive objectivity \u2192 taming opacity  \n\nHelen Longino\u2019s interactive objectivity emphasizes critical dialogue among researchers with diverse backgrounds and value commitments.  Transparency amplified by adversarial critique uncovers hidden assumptions.  The epistemic community functions as a distributed error-detecting network.\n\nExample: Climate modelling consortia share code, post raw data, and invite external modeling groups to replicate and critique results.  This interactive openness targets opacity risk: because the modelling chain is inspectable and alternative assumptions can be run, users can see how robust projections are to parameter tweaks.\n\n4.4 Unification achieved  \n\nWhile these forms look heterogeneous, their point is singular: each reduces one dominant species of epistemic vulnerability, thereby rendering the resulting claim eligible for rational trust.  They are complementary\u2014no single form exhausts objectivity.  A highly standardized measurement may still be vulnerable to industry funding (interference), and a well-debated qualitative study may still reflect idiosyncratic coding practices.  Objectivity, consequently, is an ecological achievement: the more dimensions of vulnerability a claim survives, the more \u201cobjective\u201d it is.\n\n5. Re-reading Fine and Douglas under the vulnerability lens  \n\nFine\u2019s slogan \u201cobjectivity = trust\u201d was advanced in the context of his Natural Ontological Attitude, a middle path between realism and antirealism.  The idea was deliberately deflationary: we trust successful science without metaphysical surpluses.  But because Fine declined to specify the conditions under which trust is rational, the slogan risks triviality: we also \u201ctrust\u201d horoscopes if we\u2019re gullible.  The vulnerability account sharpens Fine\u2019s point.  Trust directed at claims that have passed vulnerability-reducing procedures is uniquely epistemically responsible.  Thus the content of the attitude is unchanged, but its norm is now articulated.\n\nDouglas speaks of values \u201cinteracting\u201d with science and of objectivity as \u201ctrustworthiness.\u201d  She rightly emphasizes that objectivity is not value-freedom but value-managed inquiry.  The present account supplies the systematic backbone: values threaten interference risk; interactive objectivity keeps them in check by making value judgments explicit and contestable.\n\n6. Objections and replies  \n\nObjection 1:  Isn\u2019t \u201cvulnerability reduction\u201d just reliabilism in new clothes?  \nReply:  No.  Reliabilism appraises belief-forming processes by their statistical tendency toward truth, regardless of whether agents can recognize that reliability.  Objectivity, on my story, demands public recognizability of the safeguards.  A perfectly reliable oracle locked in a black box would fail the opacity test and hence not be objective, though reliabilists might count its deliverances as knowledge.\n\nObjection 2:  The account inflates objectivity into a catch-all for \u201cgood scientific practice.\u201d  What remains distinctive?  \nReply:  The focus on vulnerability confines the scope.  Many \u201cgood practices\u201d (efficient data storage, generous mentoring) do not directly mitigate idiosyncrasy, interference, or opacity; they therefore contribute marginally, if at all, to objectivity.  Conversely, a practice that scores high on vulnerability reduction (pre-registration) is labelled objective even if it is inconvenient or costly.\n\nObjection 3:  Some sciences (e.g., paleontology) cannot implement procedural objectivity because the objects are unrepeatable.  Does the account deem them non-objective?  \nReply:  No.  The framework is dimension-relative.  Paleontology cannot replicate dinosaurs, but it can pursue convergence (multiple fossil beds, isotope analysis) and interaction (open databases, morphology debates).  Objectivity is graded; a claim can compensate for weakness on one dimension by strength on others.\n\nObjection 4:  Feminist epistemologists warn that community interaction may reinscribe hegemonic power, not eliminate bias.  \nReply:  Exactly.  That is a live opacity risk: marginalized voices detect assumptions invisible to dominant groups.  The account therefore predicts that without genuine diversity, interactive objectivity underperforms.  Longino\u2019s requirement of \u201ctempered equality\u201d is a specification of the same vulnerability logic.\n\n7. Implications  \n\n1. Policy: Regulatory agencies asking \u201cIs this study objective?\u201d should translate the question: Which vulnerabilities remain insufficiently addressed?  For instance, industry-funded toxicology may excel procedurally yet fail interference checks.  \n\n2. Journalism: Explaining \u201cobjectivity\u201d to the public is easier when framed as \u201clayers of safeguards against ways we could have been wrong,\u201d rather than abstract neutrality.  \n\n3. Normative upshot: Because new technologies (machine learning, CRISPR) introduce novel failure modes (algorithmic opacity, off-target edits), objectivity is dynamic.  The concept instructs the community: invent new safeguards.\n\n4. Theoretical: The account mediates between \u201cobjective-enough\u201d pragmatists and value-free idealists.  Yes, values permeate science; but they are disciplined via vulnerability-oriented mechanisms.\n\n8. Conclusion  \n\nCalling a scientific claim \u201cobjective\u201d should not be cash-value ambiguous.  On the refined account, it means: This claim has survived a suite of practices deliberately engineered to neutralize the main forms of epistemic vulnerability\u2014idiosyncrasy, interference, opacity.  Trust, in the sense of rational, second-personal reliance by parties who lack direct access to the phenomenon, is the downstream attitude that these safeguards license.  The familiar varieties of objectivity are unified because each targets a distinct vulnerability dimension.  Hence Fine\u2019s and Douglas\u2019s insight is preserved but precisified: objectivity is not trust itself, nor mere trustworthiness, but the publicly accessible basis upon which trustworthiness is rationally judged.", "output_tokens": 3165, "reasoning_tokens": 704}

Framing the Problem  \nWhen philosophers of science call a result \u201cobjective,\u201d they often add, in the same breath, that it is the sort of thing we can trust.  Arthur Fine writes that objectivity \u201cis nothing less than trustworthiness itself,\u201d while Heather Douglas argues that the \u201ccore function\u201d of objectivity talk is to mark claims \u201cworthy of public trust.\u201d  Yet \u201ctrust\u201d covers an unruly territory: faith, hope, interpersonal dependence, reliability, legitimacy, even moral probity.  If all that unites the many senses of objectivity is a vague aura of trustworthiness, the notion threatens to dissolve into rhetorical fog.\n\nMy thesis is two-fold.\n\n1. The relation between objectivity and trust is not merely semantic (\u201cobjective = trusted\u201d) but functional: to call a procedure, datum, or model objective is to invite others to transfer epistemic responsibility to it.  Objectivity is the property of being an *entitlement-conferring warrant*\u2014a warrant that rationally licenses third parties, including non-experts, to treat the deliverances of a process as if they had made the observations themselves.\n\n2. The apparently disparate species of scientific objectivity\u2014procedural, convergent, interactive, and so forth\u2014are unified because each furnishes that same entitlement by securing *robustness to epistemic perspective*.  Where procedural objectivity achieves robustness by eliminating idiosyncratic influences, convergent objectivity achieves it by cross-checking results across diverse routes, and interactive objectivity does so by organized contestation.  Their common explanatory core is the production of deliverances that remain stable under relevant transformations of perspective; that stability is what turns an epistemic product into a trustworthy public warrant.\n\nIn what follows I develop this claim, clarify key distinctions, show how the unifying account illuminates canonical cases, and respond to likely objections.\n\n2. Why \u201cTrust\u201d Needs Disambiguation  \nWe intuitively contrast trusting a friend to keep a secret with trusting a thermometer to read 20 \u00b0C, yet philosophers often run these forms of reliance together.  Two distinctions are crucial.\n\na. Trust vs. Mere Reliability  \nI may rely on my alarm clock without trusting it in any emotionally laden sense; I simply regard it as reliably ticking.  In contrast, trust proper involves a normative stance: I not only expect the trusted agent (or system) to perform but also feel entitled to blame if it betrays that expectation.  Call this normative stance *uptake responsibility*: in trusting, I transfer to the trusted entity a portion of the responsibility for belief formation.\n\nb. Interpersonal vs. Systemic Trust  \nTrust can be directed at individual persons, distributed networks (a peer-review system), material artefacts (a standardized pipette), or hybrids of these.  Scientific practice is unthinkable without systemic trust; no physicist personally verifies every laser calibration chain.\n\nBecause objectivity talk is largely impersonal, the trust invoked is *systemic normative trust*: an entitlement to rely on a distributed socio-technical arrangement when forming beliefs.\n\n3. Objectivity as Entitlement-Conferring Robustness  \nConsider an everyday claim of objectivity: \u201cThe mass of the electron is 9.109 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b3\u00b9 kg.\u201d  Only a handful of precision experimentalists have directly measured the relevant cyclotron frequencies.  For everyone else\u2014from astrophysicists to undergraduates\u2014assent is rational because the claim carries a *public warrant*: we are entitled to shift the epistemic responsibility for that figure onto the experimentation-and-evaluation pipeline of contemporary physics.  Call this phenomenon an *uptake-responsibility shift* (URS).\n\nURSs become rational only when putative warrants are *robust to epistemic perspective*: changes in instrumentation, laboratory location, background assumptions, cultural values, or personal biases do not readily overturn them.  Invariant deliverances inspire justified systemic trust because one\u2019s own limited perspective appears dispensable.\n\nThis framing simultaneously explains why objectivity is linked to trust (it licenses URS) and reveals what unifies the many senses of objectivity (each secures robustness to perspective in a characteristic way).\n\n4. Mapping the Varieties of Objectivity onto Robustness Strategies  \n\n4.1 Procedural Objectivity  \nClassical experimental protocols (double-blind trials, standardized reagents, algorithmic data cleaning) aim to *eliminate idiosyncrasy*.  They suppress subjective coloration by regimenting individual action through rules.  The resultant data should\u2014ideally\u2014be exportable from any competent laboratory to any other.  The robustness strategy here is *variance-reduction*: hold constant whatever differs from one perspective to the next.  Because outcomes do not depend on who runs the trial, third parties can responsibly shift uptake.\n\nExample: A Cochrane-style meta-analysis of antidepressant efficacy relies on trials where allocation concealment, prespecified endpoints, and blinding ensure that personal expectations of clinicians do not inflate effect sizes.  Users trust the meta-analysis not because they inspect each patient record but because procedural safeguards make results insensitive to treating physicians\u2019 perspectives.\n\n4.2 Convergent Objectivity  \nHere robustness comes from *heterogeneity*: pursue the same quantity or phenomenon with independent methods, instruments, and epistemic standpoints.  Agreement across multiple routes indicates that no single route\u2019s peculiarities drive the result.\n\nExample: Measurements of the Hubble constant via cosmic microwave background anisotropies, Cepheid variable calibration, and strong lensing time delays.  Each method embodies distinct modeling assumptions, systematic errors, and observational technologies.  Convergence across them is powerful precisely because their biases are largely independent.  The public therefore gains a composite warrant that survives perturbations in any one perspective.\n\n4.3 Interactive Objectivity  \nRobustness can also be won through structured contestation among differently situated agents\u2014\u201cthe conversation stopping only when all the criticisms have been met.\u201d  Here objectivity is less about pre-specified procedure and more about dynamic social interaction: peer review, replication challenges, marketplace-of-ideas framing.\n\nExample: Climate modeling groups share code, critique parameterizations, and publish intercomparison studies (CMIP).  Models are regularly stress-tested by skeptics inside and outside the community.  Each criticism is a probe from a fresh perspective; surviving probes increases robustness.  Stakeholders\u2014policymakers, citizens\u2014may thus rationally adopt a URS: they hold the scientific community partly responsible for the beliefs that inform carbon policy.\n\n4.4 Quantitative vs. Qualitative Objectivity  \nMeasurement-theoretic objectivity stresses invariance of quantitative magnitudes (mass, voltage), whereas interpretive disciplines (taxonomy, archaeology) seek stability of qualitative classifications under changes of framework.  The same analysis applies: classificatory decisions are objective when peer communities with diverse theoretical lenses nevertheless converge or when classification protocols withstand extensive critique.\n\n5. Why Robustness, Not Just Reliability, Matters  \nOne might protest: if the electron mass figure is simply *reliable*, what extra work does robustness do?  Reliability is a property of outputs; robustness is a property of how outputs respond to inputs.  A thermometer that reads the correct temperature only because my room happens to remain at 20 \u00b0C is accidentally reliable but not robust; a small perturbation (draft from an open window) breaks it.  Scientific objectivity stakes the stronger claim that results remain stable across a counterfactual neighborhood of perspectives and conditions.\n\nThis difference maps directly onto trust.  I can justifiably transfer uptake responsibility only when the deliverance would remain correct under many relevant variations I cannot myself rule out.  Robustness makes my reliance *safe*; bare reliability does not.\n\n6. Objections and Replies\n\nObjection 1: Constructivist Challenge  \nObjectivity, one might argue, is a rhetorical device by which dominant groups cloak value-laden procedures in the prestige of neutrality.  Robustness to perspective is no guarantee against systemic bias if all perspectives are formed within the same power structure.\n\nReply: Two points.\n\na. The robustness standard is *indexed to relevant perspectives*.  If marginalized standpoints are excluded, robustness is spurious.  Interactive objectivity in particular shows its teeth by requiring that dissenting, including politically marginalized, perspectives be integrated into the critical conversation.\n\nb. The account therefore yields an operational diagnostic: ask which perspectives were represented in testing stability.  That diagnostic can vindicate feminist calls for epistemic diversity not as an add-on but as integral to objectivity.\n\nObjection 2: Trust Is About People, Not Processes  \nLuhmann and other sociologists contend that only persons can be trusted; mechanisms are merely relied on.  Does the URS analysis stretch \u201ctrust\u201d beyond ordinary usage?\n\nReply: Practical discourse already treats systems as trust objects.  Citizens \u201ctrust the FDA,\u201d journal editors \u201ctrust an algorithm not to reveal reviewer identities,\u201d pilots \u201ctrust the altimeter.\u201d  What unifies these cases is not affective warmth but responsibility transfer.  If a mechanism misleads, we seek explanations, assign blame, and demand restitution\u2014social responses characteristic of breach of trust.  The URS analysis captures that normative dimension.\n\nObjection 3: Too Strong\u2014Many Objective Claims Fail Robustness Tests  \nReplication crises reveal domains (social psychology, preclinical biomedicine) where standard methods did not secure robustness to perspective.  Does our analysis imply those claims were never objective?\n\nReply: Yes\u2014in a salutary sense.  Calling early\u2010millennium priming research \u201cobjective\u201d was aspirational, not descriptive.  Identifying the failure of robustness (non-replication under methodologically diverse conditions) precisely diagnoses why the trust was underserved.  The account thereby explains both the uptake and its withdrawal.\n\n7. Consequences for Scientific Governance  \nOnce objectivity is seen as entitlement-conferring robustness, institutional design questions become tractable.\n\na. Designing Procedures: We should prioritize variance-reduction strategies only when between-agent biases dominate.  Where modeler assumptions drive uncertainty (e.g., macroeconomic forecasting), heterogeneity or interactive critique may be more effective.\n\nb. Transparency vs. Closed Procedure: Transparency is not an intrinsic requirement of objectivity.  What matters is whether concealed steps introduce perspectival fragility.  Double-blind protocols deliberately obscure certain information to *increase* robustness.  The present account rationalizes such exceptions without abandoning the ideal of public trust.\n\nc. Communicating Science: Scientists often respond to public skepticism by reiterating credentials or procedural rigor.  A robustness-centered message\u2014\u201cHere are the tests our claim survived, here are the perspectives consulted\u201d\u2014speaks directly to the entitlement the public seeks.\n\n8. Comparison with Rival Unification Attempts  \nHelen Longino\u2019s \u201ccritical contextual empiricism\u201d unifies objectivity through \u201ctransformative criticism,\u201d Doris Hellman through \u201cinvariance under transformations,\u201d and James Woodward through \u201cinterventionist robustness.\u201d  The current proposal renders these not competing but complementary: they describe distinct robustness strategies under the single explanatory umbrella of URS-licensing.  This synthesis has two payoffs.\n\n1. Explanatory Economy: One need not choose among the list of objectivities; each earns its keep by indicating *how* robustness is achieved in a specific epistemic context.\n\n2. Novel Prediction: Where no perspective-robustness route is available, objectivity claims will ring hollow.  This predicts persistent controversy in domains where value conflict makes robustness difficult (e.g., risk assessment for low-probability, high-impact events).\n\n9. Toward a Formal Characterization  \nAlthough the present essay is primarily conceptual, the unifying idea admits of formal treatment.  Suppose an epistemic product E results from process P.  Let S be the set of relevant perspectives, modeled as transformations \u03c4 on the background assumptions, instruments, or social positions of agents.  Then P is objectively trustworthy iff for all \u03c4 in S, P\u2218\u03c4 yields E within tolerance \u03b5.  The public warrant is the quantification over \u03c4: it tells non-experts they need not compute the transformations themselves.  Formalizing robustness as invariance under group action imports mathematical tools (stability analysis, group theory) into the study of objectivity, opening a research programme that connects philosophical analysis with empirical metascience.\n\n10. Conclusion  \nObjectivity and trust are indeed entwined, but the tie is not the fuzzy identity Fine and Douglas gesture at.  Scientific objectivity is best understood as the feature of an epistemic product or process that *licenses the public to transfer epistemic responsibility to it*.  What licenses that transfer is robustness to perspective: deliverances remain stable under the range of transformations characteristic of the audience\u2019s possible standpoints.  Procedural, convergent, and interactive objectivity are species of a single genus because each secures such robustness in its own way\u2014by eliminating idiosyncrasy, multiplying heterogeneous routes, or organizing systematic criticism.  This analysis clarifies why objectivity failures provoke crises of trust, guides institutional design aimed at regaining that trust, and offers a precise, formally tractable criterion for what unifies the many senses of objectivity.  By turning the vague appeal to \u201ctrustworthiness\u201d into the concrete notion of entitlement-conferring robustness, we not only solve the unification puzzle but also provide a tool for navigating the epistemic demands of a pluralistic, technologically mediated society.", "output_tokens": 3353, "reasoning_tokens": 576}

Introduction and Thesis\n\nWhen scientists, policy\u2013makers, or lay citizens declare a result \u201cobjective,\u201d they typically mean more than that it was produced by respectable people or that it feels correct.  Arthur Fine\u2019s gloss\u2014objectivity is what we \u201cmay trust\u201d\u2014captures an important pragmatic dimension, but it leaves two pressing questions unanswered.  First, in what sense does objectivity ground warranted trust rather than merely elicit psychological confidence?  Second, why do the apparently heterogeneous senses catalogued by philosophers\u2014procedural objectivity (following agreed\u2010upon methods), convergent objectivity (independent agreement on results), interactive objectivity (critical dialogue across perspectives), and others\u2014jointly deserve the honorific \u201cobjective\u201d?  \n\nMy thesis is twofold.\n\n1. Objectivity is best understood, not as trust itself, but as that complex set of features of scientific practices and products that renders trust epistemically warranted by making them resilient across relevant dimensions of variation (in person, perspective, and procedure).   \n2. The diverse senses of objectivity are unified by their contribution to a single robustness criterion:  they each reduce the sensitivity of claims to idiosyncratic factors that, if unchecked, would make uptake by a wider community unreasonable.  Procedural objectivity neutralizes personal idiosyncrasy by imposing shared methods; convergent objectivity neutralizes contextual idiosyncrasy by demanding agreement from independent inquiries; interactive objectivity neutralizes perspective\u2010dependence by institutionally staging critical encounters.  Understood this way, objectivity provides the warrant for trusting use\u2014personal, institutional, or public\u2014while trust is the attitude thereby justified.\n\nPut metaphorically:  objectivity is the engineering of a bridge that can reliably bear epistemic load; trust is the traveler\u2019s decision to cross.  What unifies the engineering choices\u2014steel cables, trusses, or suspension\u2014is their contribution to load\u2010bearing robustness, not any superficial similarity.\n\n2. Why Fine\u2019s \u201cWe Can Trust It\u201d Needs Refinement\n\nFine\u2019s slogan succeeds in shifting attention from the metaphysics (\u201cobjectivity is correspondence with reality\u201d) to social epistemology (\u201cobjectivity is what can be relied on\u201d).  Yet two ambiguities persist.\n\nA. Trust as Attitude vs. Trustworthiness as Property  \n\u201cI trust aspirin\u201d and \u201caspirin is trustworthy\u201d are not equivalent.  I may unwarrantedly trust a pseudoscientific remedy.  Conversely, a medication may be trustworthy even while a misinformed public distrusts it.  Conflating the attitude with its grounds collapses the normative distinction between justified and unjustified trust.\n\nB. The Scope of Trust  \nTrust can be moral (I trust you with my secrets), prudential (I trust the elevator not to fall), or epistemic (I trust a thermometer\u2019s reading).  Objectivity speaks primarily to the epistemic dimension; it supports reliance on claims as evidential inputs to further inquiry and action.\n\nHence, to understand objectivity we must characterize the *grounds of epistemically warranted trust*, not trust itself.  That task demands a more precise account of how objectivity is achieved and why the historically disparate criteria for objectivity genuinely converge on a single normative function.\n\n3. Robustness Across Variations:  A Unifying Principle\n\n3.1 The Intuitive Core\n\nImagine you wish to know whether a cheaply produced COVID rapid test is trustworthy.  You consider:  \n\n\u2022 Was it manufactured by following validated procedures?  \n\u2022 Have independent labs replicated its sensitivity and specificity?  \n\u2022 Were diverse peer reviewers able to vet the raw data and challenge potential biases?\n\nEach affirmative answer removes one way the result could be parochial:  procedural adherence guards against individual sloppiness, independent replication against laboratory\u2013specific artifacts, and critical dialogue against perspectival blind spots.  The three strategies differ in mechanism yet converge on a single epistemic effect:  they reduce a claim\u2019s *fragility* vis-\u00e0-vis sources of variation irrelevant to the truth about the virus.  Call this the Robustness Principle:\n\nRobustness Principle.  A scientific claim is objective to the extent that its acceptance is insensitive to the idiosyncrasies of individuals, contexts, and perspectives that are irrelevant to its truth.    \n\nRobustness is therefore *modal*:  it concerns what would happen were we to vary certain factors while holding the world fixed.  Objectivity, on this view, is not accuracy itself but stability of accuracy\u2010conducive performance across counterfactual scenarios.  The link to warranted trust is immediate:  what is robust against misleading variations supplies good reasons for downstream users to rely on it even when they cannot revisit all the original evidence.\n\n3.2 Three Axes of Variation and the Standard Taxonomy\n\nApplying the principle clarifies why the three canonical senses of objectivity each pick out a different axis of variation:\n\n1. Procedural Objectivity (Hacking, Porter)  \n   Axis controlled:  individual discretion.  Shared protocols, calibration standards, and \u201cmechanical objectivity\u201d minimize personal judgment, making results robust against variation in experimenter intentions or skill.  \n\n2. Convergent Objectivity (Peirce, Wimsatt)  \n   Axis controlled:  experimental or contextual settings.  Independent laboratories, alternative models, and diverse instrumentation produce results that converge despite variations in local environment and implementational details.\n\n3. Interactive Objectivity (Longino, Douglas)  \n   Axis controlled:  perspectives and background assumptions.  Institutionalized criticism\u2014peer review, adversarial collaboration, openly shared data\u2014renders claims robust with respect to differing theoretical commitments, value orientations, and social standpoints.\n\nThough each axis appears distinct, all three implement the same robustness strategy:  identify a salient class of potential distorters, design practices that neutralize their effect, and thereby secure the stability required for justified trust.\n\n4. From Robustness to Warranted Trust\n\n4.1 Epistemic Division of Labor\n\nModern science operates under extreme epistemic division of labor; no single agent can reproduce the entire evidential basis of even a modest climate model or biomedical trial.  Consequently, downstream users\u2014pharmacists, regulators, citizens\u2014must rely on testimony.  Trust becomes unavoidable, yet unqualified deference would be epistemically reckless.  Objectivity, on the robustness account, is the ensemble of institutional design features that compensate for the inaccessibility of the first\u2010order evidence by generating *second\u2010order* reasons:  assurances that, had the scientists been biased, incompetent, or unlucky, the process would likely have revealed it.\n\n4.2 Trust as a Second\u2010Personal Attitude\n\nOn this view, trust is a second\u2010personal, diachronic attitude (I commit to rely on your word tomorrow) while objectivity is a structural, synchronic property (the process embeds robustifying safeguards today).  The former responds rationally to the latter.  Such separation explains how disinformation campaigns can succeed:  by mimicking the social signals of objectivity\u2014white lab coats, citations, peer review\u2010like websites\u2014they can illicitly borrow the trappings of robustness without the substance, thereby inducing unwarranted trust.\n\n4.3 Example:  LIGO\u2019s Gravitational Waves\n\nThe 2016 claim of direct gravitational wave detection illustrates the linkage.  Procedural objectivity:  detectors at Livingston and Hanford followed identical calibration protocols.  Convergent objectivity:  the characteristic \u201cchirp\u201d was observed independently, within milliseconds, at both sites.  Interactive objectivity:  the collaboration released data for open scrutiny, leading to dozens of re\u2010analyses.  The robustness across persons (different teams), sites (different noise spectra), and perspectives (different data\u2010analysis pipelines) provided the wider scientific community with second\u2010order reasons to trust the claim\u2014hence its rapid incorporation into cosmology curricula.\n\n5. Dialectical Engagement\n\n5.1 Feminist and Pragmatist Objections\n\nCritics from feminist epistemology contend that objectivity talk obscures power relations and entrenches majority perspectives.  Pragmatists argue that scientific success is better measured by problem\u2010solving efficacy than by illusory neutrality.  How does the robustness account respond?\n\nReply.  Robustness is compatible with value\u2010laden inquiry precisely because the interactive dimension treats value diversity as a *resource*:  competing standpoints probe for hidden sensitivities.  The account thus vindicates the feminist insight that inclusion of marginalized perspectives increases objectivity, not by removing values but by neutralizing any single value orientation\u2019s distorting potential.  Pragmatists can agree:  robustness stabilizes reliability across contexts, which underwrites the practical success they prize.  The disagreement dissolves once we see objectivity as robustness, not purity from values.\n\n5.2 Relativist Challenge:  Whose Idiosyncrasies?\n\nAn interlocutor might press:  Variation along which axes counts as relevant?  What one community deems an \u201cidiosyncratic\u201d theological assumption, another takes as evidentially germane.  Does objectivity then reduce to community\u2010relative endorsement?\n\nReply.  The robustness account offers a criterion:  a factor is epistemically irrelevant if, *holding the world fixed*, varying that factor systematically impairs truth\u2010tracking without rational compensating benefit.  The determination is fallible and revisable, but not arbitrary; it is itself subject to empirical and critical scrutiny.  For example, racial homogeneity in medical trials was once deemed irrelevant.  Accumulated evidence about differential drug metabolism revealed that it was, in fact, a relevant axis.  Objectivity consequently demanded expanded demographic representation.  Thus relativity is mitigated by empirical feedback, not fiat.\n\n6. Precision in Distinctions\n\nThe robustness approach clarifies several oft\u2010blurred distinctions.\n\n\u2022 Objectivity vs. Neutrality:  A method can be robust yet value\u2010laden; values may guide research questions while safeguards ensure that empirical claims remain insensitive to the investigators\u2019 hopes.\n\n\u2022 Trust vs. Trustworthiness:  Psychological confidence is neither necessary nor sufficient for warranted reliance.  Robustness targets trustworthiness; appropriate trust is the epistemically rational response.\n\n\u2022 Reproducibility vs. Convergence:  A single lab\u2019s ability to rerun its protocol measures procedural fidelity, while cross\u2010laboratory convergence addresses contextual variation.  The replication crisis illustrates how neglecting convergence falsely inflates perceived objectivity.\n\n7. Substantive Payoff:  Metrics and Institutional Design\n\nThe robustness account yields actionable guidance.\n\n7.1 Quantitative Metrics\n\nStatistical techniques such as multiverse analysis and sensitivity analysis operationalize robustness by quantifying how inferences vary across model choices.  Regulators evaluating drug safety can demand robustness reports:  matrices showing effect sizes across plausible analytic pipelines.\n\n7.2 Institutional Architecture\n\nFunding agencies and journals can incentivize robustness rather than mere novelty by:\n\n\u2022 Requiring registered reports (procedural axis)  \n\u2022 Supporting replication networks (convergent axis)  \n\u2022 Encouraging adversarial collaborations and open peer commentary (interactive axis)\n\nThese policies embed the social preconditions for warranted trust, aligning institutional goals with epistemic robustness rather than prestige or productivity alone.\n\n8. Extensions and Open Questions\n\n8.1 Computational Science\n\nWhen results emerge from opaque simulations, traditional procedural oversight is inadequate.  Robustness suggests complementary strategies:  code diversity (independent implementations), ensemble modeling, and software randomization tests.  These instantiate convergent and procedural objectivity in silico.\n\n8.2 Citizen Science and Public Trust\n\nWhere non\u2010experts directly collect or assess data (galaxy classification, biodiversity counts), robustness entails simplified, transparent protocols (procedural) and cross\u2010validation with professional datasets (convergent).  Demonstrating such robustness can rebuild public trust eroded by perceived elitism.\n\n8.3 Normative Trade-offs\n\nRobustness is not cost\u2010free; maximizing it can slow inquiry.  Future work must articulate thresholds:  when is a claim robust enough for the decisions at stake?  Risk analysis frameworks can integrate robustness metrics with decision\u2010theoretic considerations, tailoring objectivity demands to application context.\n\n9. Conclusion\n\nFine and Douglas were right that objectivity and trust are intimately linked, but the mere equation \u201cobjective = trustworthy\u201d blurs critical distinctions.  A more precise relationship emerges when we view objectivity through the lens of robustness across relevant dimensions of variation.  The multiple senses of objectivity are not rival theories; they are complementary engineering specifications for achieving the single aim of warranted epistemic trust in a world of limited cognitive resources and plural perspectives.  \n\nObjectivity so conceived is not a metaphysical virtue floating above social practice, nor a myth of view-from-nowhere purity.  It is a socially sustained, continually revised strategy for building claims sturdy enough that they can be handed from one inquirer to another across the fragile bridges of testimony.  Trust is the traveler\u2019s step; objectivity is the integrity of the span.", "output_tokens": 3044, "reasoning_tokens": 320}

Prelude: Why the \u201cTrust\u201d Motif Is Tempting  \nMany philosophers of science\u2014Arthur Fine\u2019s \u201cA Theory of No-One\u2019s Truth,\u201d Heather Douglas\u2019s \u201cScience, Policy, and the Value-Free Ideal,\u201d and others\u2014have remarked that when ordinary language calls some result or procedure \u201cobjective,\u201d what is meant, at bottom, is that it can be trusted. The shrinkage of the complex phenomenon of objectivity to the simpler phenomenon of trust is intuitively appealing: both evoke security, a sense that we can \u201clet our guard down.\u201d Moreover, scientific work is unavoidably cooperative; epistemic labor is traded across space and time, so some amount of trust is indispensable. That a link exists is undeniable.\n\nBut the assimilation is also suspiciously imprecise. \u201cTrust\u201d is an attitude or stance taken by an agent; \u201cobjectivity\u201d is usually interpreted as a property of practices, products, or whole research cultures. Equating them elides that ontological difference. Worse, trust comes in many flavors\u2014moral, epistemic, opportunistic\u2014and in many degrees. A global assertion \u201cobjective = trusted\u201d consequently risks vacuity: anything one chooses to trust becomes \u201cobjective,\u201d anything doubted \u201csubjective.\u201d\n\nThe question, then, bifurcates:\n\nA. What exactly is the epistemic relation between objectivity and trust?  \nB. Can we supply a principled, non-trivial unifying core for the heterogeneous senses of objectivity\u2014procedural, convergent, interactive\u2014so that the relation is neither accidental nor a mere slogan?\n\nMy thesis: Objectivity is not identical to trust, nor even primarily a psychological pre-condition of it. Rather, \u201cobjectivity\u201d names a structured, multi-layered capacity for *error-resilience*: the way scientific products and processes insulate final judgments from the idiosyncrasies of particular persons, instruments, or local interests. Trust is downstream. Objectivity justifies warranted *entitlement to uptake*\u2014a second-order normative license to rely on results one did not oneself produce or verify. The diverse senses of objectivity are unified precisely insofar as they are complementary institutional strategies for constructing such error-resilience.\n\n2. Three Classical Senses Revisited Through Error-Resilience  \n\n2.1 Procedural Objectivity  \nInitially championed by the 19th-century ideal of \u201cmechanical objectivity\u201d (Daston & Galison), procedural objectivity takes impersonality as its watchword. Thermometry, for instance, exchanged \u201cfeverishness\u201d for mercury expansion; DNA sequencing replaced gel-reading judgment calls with automated base-calling algorithms. The epistemic function, however, is not impersonality for its own sake but insulation from *personal bias*: calibrating decisions pass through algorithmic or rule-governed pipelines that are, in principle, reproducible by any competent agent.\n\n2.2 Convergent Objectivity  \nA different route to error-resilience exploits pluralism of method. If cosmic expansion rates, measured via standard candles, gravitational waves, and CMB anisotropies, converge on the same H\u2080 value within error margins, each idiosyncratic error model is cross-vetted by the others. Agreement achieved through *multiperspectival robustness* dampens the chance that a shared blind spot infects them all. \n\n2.3 Interactive (Social) Objectivity  \nHelen Longino\u2019s and Heather Douglas\u2019s interactive ideal emphasizes critical contestation: peer review, replication attempts, adversarial collaboration, and norm-governed debate. The social mechanism aims at neutralizing the parochial standpoint of any single research group by making their claims vulnerable to systematic scrutiny. Error-resilience here is achieved via institutionalized dissent.\n\nThe common denominator across these modes is neither impersonality, nor consensus, nor sociality per se. It is the deliberate construction of *checks that would expose and thus limit plausible sources of error*.\n\n3. Parsing \u201cTrust\u201d More Finely  \n\nBefore welding trust to this error-resilience view, we must anatomize the term. Bernard Williams distinguishes *reliance* (mere predictive expectation) from *trust* (reliance plus the attribution of good faith). Carolyn McLeod adds *normative expectation*: if I trust you, I deem you obligated not to betray it. For present purposes we need a thinner, strictly epistemic notion: an agent *A* epistemically trusts content *p* vouchsafed by source *S* iff *A* treats *p* as warrant enough for action or further inference without re-deriving or re-testing it.\n\nCrucially, trust in this sense is a *second-order* phenomenon: we are not assessing *p* directly but assessing whether *S* is competent and non-deceptive with respect to *p*. Thus \u201cobjectivity\u201d cannot be the same as \u201ctrust\u201d; it is rather (I propose) a *property of S* that satisfies the conditions underwriting licensed trust.\n\n4. The Core Proposal: Objectivity as Structured Error-Resilience  \n\nDefinition (first pass). A scientific deliverable (data set, measurement, model, or law-statement) is *objective* to the extent that:\n\nER1. Systematic mechanisms have been deployed to expose and dampen error sources rooted in individual standpoint, local instrument configuration, and value orientation.  \nER2. These mechanisms are public: any competent peer with reasonable resources could, in principle, audit them.  \nER3. The deliverable remains stable across relevantly different pathways\u2014methodological, material, social\u2014such that failures in any single pathway would have been detectable.\n\nCall ER1-ER3 collectively *robust error-resilience* (RER).\n\nNow the link to trust becomes perspicuous: RER is what epistemically entitles the wider community to treat that deliverable as *reliably usable*, i.e., as if it were their own carefully vetted result. To say a claim is \u201cobjective\u201d is shorthand for: \u201cRER exists to a degree that justifies deference by non-producers.\u201d\n\n5. Illustrative Case Studies  \n\n5.1 The Planck Constant and the Kibble Balance (Procedural)  \nHistorically, Planck\u2019s constant h had inconsistent values. The adoption of the Kibble balance metrological protocol\u2014where electrical and mechanical power are equated via quantum Hall and Josephson effects\u2014furnished RER by replacing human judgment with closed physical loops anchored in quantum invariants. Once the kilogram was re-defined through h, laboratories worldwide re-calibrated their mass standards *without direct consultation*, exhibiting epistemic trust licensed by procedural objectivity.\n\n5.2 Multi-Method Climate Sensitivity Estimates (Convergent)  \nClimate sensitivity (\u0394T at doubling CO\u2082) is inferred from paleoclimate proxies, instrumental records, and general circulation model ensembles. Each route has distinct structural uncertainties: proxy dating errors, aerosol forcing, cloud microphysics. Their overlap yields narrower credible intervals than any single route. When the IPCC assigns \u201chigh confidence\u201d to a 2.5\u20134 \u00b0C range, it does so because convergence secures RER; policymakers then trust the figure in crafting emissions targets.\n\n5.3 Regulatory Science in Pharmacology (Interactive)  \nRandomized controlled trials (RCTs) manifest procedural objectivity, but consider adversarial \u201chead-to-head\u201d trials mandated by the European Medicines Agency. Competing firms critique each other\u2019s protocols, and independent statisticians have veto rights. The contestatory scaffolding institutionalizes RER; physicians trust efficacy estimates enough to prescribe without personally re-analyzing raw data.\n\n6. Dialectical Engagement  \n\nObjection 1: \u201cYour account is circular: we judge mechanisms by whether they confer reliability, but reliability is inferred from previous trust-worthy mechanisms.\u201d  \nReply: The worry dissolves when we recognize *bootstrapping layers*. Early science achieved objectivity through low-tech mutual scrutiny; later technological and statistical techniques were vetted against those earlier outcomes, gradually expanding the error-resilience envelope. The regress halts at basic perceptual judgments shared among inquirers\u2014Callender\u2019s minimal empiricism. The account is no more circular than standard reliabilism in epistemology.\n\nObjection 2: \u201cHistory furnishes cases where apparent convergence masked systemic bias\u2014phrenology enjoyed agreement among practitioners.\u201d  \nReply: RER contains a counter-illumination clause: mechanisms must *detect* errors if present. Phrenology lacked independent error probes; cranial measurement tools and interpretive norms were never put under serious challenge. Thus it was never objective despite superficial consensus. The example illustrates the indispensability of ER2 and ER3.\n\nObjection 3: \u201cSome crucial steps, e.g. in high-energy physics, are opaque to most scientists; trust in the CERN collaboration is almost blind.\u201d  \nReply: Opaqueness to laypersons is compatible with accessibility to experts. RER demands that competent peers could audit; de facto, several rival groups within CERN analyze the same data streams with orthogonal pipelines, and experimental software is open to collaboration members worldwide. Full democratization is not required, only feasible contestation.\n\nObjection 4: \u201cValues infiltrate all three mechanisms\u2014choice of significance levels, model priors, what counts as a \u2018relevantly different pathway\u2019. Doesn\u2019t that vitiate objectivity?\u201d  \nReply: Value-laden choices are inevitable, but RER absorbs them by forcing explicit articulation and exposure. If stakeholders disagree, they can replicate the analysis under alternative priors. Objectivity, on this view, is not value-free; it is *value-manageable*.\n\n7. Theoretical Payoffs  \n\n7.1 Unification Without Reduction  \nWe do not claim that procedural, convergent, and interactive objectivity collapse into a single process. Rather, they are *distinct design strategies* whose success conditions are all explained by the more general property of error-resilience. This is analogous to the way different dietary patterns (Mediterranean, DASH, pescatarian) all promote cardiovascular health by converging on unsaturated-fat and high-fiber intake.\n\n7.2 Replacing a Psychological Metric with a Normative-Structural One  \nMaking trust the primitive (\u201cobjective = trusted\u201d) makes the notion hostage to fluctuating public psychology. Under the RER account, fluctuations in public opinion may misalign with objectivity; anti-vax distrust in MMR vaccines, for instance, does nothing to undermine the RER of the supporting studies. Conversely, widespread trust in astrology does not render it objective.\n\n7.3 Explaining Degrees of Objectivity  \nBecause error-resilience is quantifiable\u2014via sensitivity analyses, inter-laboratory variance, replication statistics\u2014we obtain a graded notion. This captures everyday scientific practice where researchers say a result is \u201cpretty robust\u201d rather than simply \u201cobjective\u201d or \u201csubjective.\u201d Trust, by contrast, is often binary.\n\n7.4 Links to Broader Epistemology  \nThe proposal harmonizes with virtue reliabilism: a belief is knowledge when produced by a reliable competence. Objectivity is the collective-level analog of individual competence, and RER specifies the reliability conditions. It also dovetails with John Hardwig\u2019s argument that modern knowledge is largely testimony; objectivity engineers the pre-conditions for acceptable testimonial absorption.\n\n8. Precision of Distinctions  \n\nDistinction 1: *First-order epistemic warrant* (evidence for p) vs. *second-order warrant* (evidence that the evidence is good). Objectivity situates at the second order; trust is a third-person attitude permitted by that second-order warrant.\n\nDistinction 2: *Reliance* vs. *trust* (Section 3). Only the latter entails epistemic credit attribution; RER specifies why such credit is deserved.\n\nDistinction 3: *Value-neutrality* vs. *value-manageability*. The latter is enough for objectivity, the former neither necessary nor typically achievable.\n\n9. Consequences and Open Research Trajectories  \n\n9.1 Objectivity\u2019s Political Economy  \nIf objectivity is engineered error-resilience, then under-funded fields\u2014say, tropical disease research\u2014may fail objectivity not from poor science but because they lack the resources to implement alternative pathways or open contestation. That reframes certain debates about \u201cneglected diseases\u201d not as pathology of epistemology but as pathology of resource allocation.\n\n9.2 AI and Automated Science  \nLarge-scale machine-learning driven discovery raises the worry of opacity. The RER framework mandates specific design imperatives: multiple independent training data sets, adversarial auditing, interpretability probes. Objectivity is attainable only if such infrastructures are built into AI pipelines.\n\n9.3 Citizen Science and Epistemic Democracy  \nInteractive objectivity shows why carefully structured lay participation (e.g., community air-quality monitoring) can, in principle, elevate objectivity by adding divergent perspective pathways, so long as the corresponding error probes are instituted.\n\n10. Coda: Reformulating the Slogan  \n\nWe can now reinterpret Fine\u2019s and Douglas\u2019s insight without the attendant vagueness. Instead of:\n\n\u201cO is objective iff O can be trusted,\u201d\n\nwe should say:\n\n\u201cO is objective iff O is produced and maintained by practices that confer robust error-resilience, thereby *entitling* epistemically responsible agents to place defeasible trust in it.\u201d\n\nThe distinction is subtle but momentous. It preserves the practical link\u2014objective outputs deserve trust\u2014while reserving \u201cobjectivity\u201d for a property amenable to independent scrutiny rather than psychic attitude. Objectivity is thus neither a mystical view from nowhere nor a mere sociological honorific. It is a hard-won, ever-fragile achievement of layered error-resilience, forged by rule, redundancy, and dispute. Trust follows not by definition but by right.\n\nThat, I submit, is the precise relationship we were seeking.", "output_tokens": 3476, "reasoning_tokens": 512}

Arthur Fine\u2019s pun that \u201cobjective results are the ones we can all take as objects of trust,\u201d and Heather Douglas\u2019s related claim that \u201cobjectivity tells us what to trust,\u201d are attractive slogans because they capture an everyday attitude: to call a result objective is to recommend it as safe to rely on. But the slogans are too coarse\u2010grained to guide either social institutions or philosophical analysis. In what follows I first differentiate the leading senses of objectivity found in recent philosophy of science, then scrutinize the logical space between objectivity and trust, and finally advance a more exact account\u2014the Robustness-Through-Independence model\u2014that shows why the disparate senses converge and how they underwrite, rather than coincide with, warranted trust.\n\n1. Mapping the terrain: four families of \u201cobjectivity\u201d\n\nExisting typologies differ in detail, but most examples can be grouped into four families.\n\na) Procedural objectivity.  The paradigm is the \u201cmechanical\u201d production of results: standardized questionnaires, double-blind trials, computer-coded data pipelines.  What is laudably objective here is conformance to impersonal procedure, which blocks individual idiosyncrasies.\n\nb) Ontic or invariance objectivity.  This family, championed by Nozick, Shapere, and more recently Hacking, focusses on independence from perspective: the melting point of tungsten or the existence of a Higgs boson.  An entity or property is objective when it is stable across changes in the observer\u2019s position, scale, or instrumentation.\n\nc) Convergent or epistemic objectivity.  Charles Sanders Peirce called the ideal end-of-inquiry the point at which \u201copinion is fated to be,\u201d and contemporary versions (Putnam, Wimsatt) understand objectivity as results that survive multiple, independent lines of evidence\u2014robustness, consilience, triangulation.\n\nd) Interactive or social objectivity.  Long before Longino coined the term, William James observed that scrutiny by diverse interlocutors cleanses thought.  For Longino, Mill, and Douglas, an inquiry is objective when the community\u2019s critical mechanisms\u2014peer review, replication, adversarial collaboration\u2014function properly.\n\nThese four families overlap in practice\u2014double-blind trials aid convergence; robust measurement protocols help secure replication\u2014but conceptually they seem distinct.  Hence the temptation to seek a unifying notion, and Fine and Douglas suggest \u201ctrust.\u201d  Let us examine that proposal.\n\n2. What kind of thing is trust?\n\n\u201cTrust\u201d is polysemous.  Three distinctions matter:\n\ni) Reliance vs. trust proper.  I rely on my laptop to boot; I trust a colleague with confidential data.  Reliance involves predictive expectation; trust involves normative expectations of goodwill or due care.\n\nii) First-order vs. second-order trust.  First-order trust targets people or instruments (\u201cI trust her spectrometer\u201d).  Second-order trust targets epistemic outputs (\u201cI trust the published temperature series\u201d).\n\niii) Personal vs. structural trust.  I may trust a single climatologist (personal) or the practice of meteorology as an institution (structural).\n\nScientific objectivity interacts with all three layers, but it is neither identical with trust nor reducible to it.  Objectivity is (I shall argue) a property of processes and products that *justify* trust\u2014especially second-order, structural trust\u2014but it is not itself an attitude.  Conflating the property and the attitude blurs critical questions: When is trust rational?  Who must trust?  Under what conditions does the property fail even though agents continue to trust (as in Tuskegee or Wakefield\u2019s vaccine paper)?  Fine\u2019s slogan, taken literally, fails to answer those questions.\n\n3. Diagnosing the need for a tighter link\n\nSaying \u201cobjectivity is what licenses trust\u201d leaves two gaps:\n\nGap A: Degrees.  Trust often comes in gradations.  We trust shuttle launch calculations less than GPS ephemerides because failure modes differ.  A binary \u201cobjective/subjective\u201d label cannot accommodate such nuance unless objectivity itself is scalar.\n\nGap B: Explanatory depth.  If trustworthiness is the explanandum, treating objectivity as its definition is circular unless we show *how* objectivity produces reliability.\n\nTo fill both gaps we need an account that (i) quantifies or at least ranks objectivity, and (ii) explains why higher degrees of objectivity systematically reduce epistemic vulnerability.  The next section sketches such an account.\n\n4. The Robustness-Through-Independence (RTI) model\n\nRTI pivots on a simple insight: every epistemic agent is vulnerable to two generic failure modes\u2014bias (systematic distortion) and noise (random error).  The various senses of objectivity can be unified by seeing them as strategies for *independence-based robustness*\u2014they aim to make the truth of a claim insensitive to the peculiarities of any single perspective, person, method, or value set.  Formally:\n\nA scientific claim C is objective to the extent that it remains stable (robust) across a set I of mutually independent transformations T\u2081\u2026T\u2099, where each T\u1d62 removes or varies some potential error source E\u1d62.\n\nInterpret the set I broadly:\n\n\u2022 Procedural independence (T removes personal judgment).  \n\u2022 Observational independence (T changes detector technology or reference frame).  \n\u2022 Evidential independence (T derives the result via a different causal pathway).  \n\u2022 Social independence (T introduces critics who do not share the claimant\u2019s values).\n\nRobustness across these orthogonal transformations gives C a kind of *invariance in error space*.  The more dimensions of independence, and the greater the distance of each transformation from the original path, the harder it becomes for any single bias or noise term to explain C.  Hence RTI turns the older slogan \u201cindependent confirmation\u201d into a quantitative heuristic: measure the dimensionality and strength of independence to estimate objectivity.\n\n5. How RTI unifies the four families\n\na) Procedural objectivity ensures independence from idiosyncratic judgment by replacing it with algorithm, randomization, or blinding.  In RTI language, the transformation T is \u201cremove knowledge of treatment assignment,\u201d eliminating bias E\u1d62 = confirmation pressure.\n\nb) Ontic/invariance objectivity makes the claim insensitive to the observer\u2019s coordinates.  T is \u201ctranslate in space-time, scale, or reference frame.\u201d  If C=\u201cwater\u2019s triple point is 273.16 K,\u201d it survives the shift from Paris to Perth, or from platinum resistance thermometry to acoustic gas thermometry.  Bias E\u1d62 = local context dependence.\n\nc) Convergent objectivity secures robustness by adding independent evidential pathways: paleoclimate proxies, satellite data, and general-circulation models converge on warming trends.  Each T changes the instrumental chain; shared bias would have to infect them all.\n\nd) Interactive objectivity adds social transformations: feminist critiques of primatology, or citizen-science replication of galaxy classification, break the homogenous value background that might mask selective reporting.  Survival across critical communities evidences robustness against motivational bias.\n\nThus, rather than a mere family resemblance, the four kinds of objectivity instantiate the same abstract architecture: they manufacture and exploit independence to secure robustness.\n\n6. From robustness to rational trust\n\nWhy does RTI underwrite trust?  Because each independent transformation functions as a \u201cstress test.\u201d  If C passes enough orthogonal tests, posterior probability that C is true rises by the familiar Bayesian logic of convergent confirmation *provided the tests are conditionally independent*.  Even non-Bayesian models (error statistics, frequentist severity) concur: if C survives severe tests aimed at detecting falsity, confidence increases rationally.  Trust, on this view, is a justified second-order attitude grounded in the mathematical fact that probability of coincident error declines exponentially with independent replication.\n\nConsider the boiling point of pure water.  Early chemists used mercury thermometers; later ones used platinum RTDs and acoustic resonators.  Each method depends on different physics.  The chance that *all* disagree by the same 0.5 K due to a shared, undiagnosed bias is astronomically low.  The public therefore rationally trusts the triple-point figure in everything from physics handbooks to engine design.\n\n7. Addressing key objections\n\nObjection 1: Independence is a fiction.  Social communities inevitably share background assumptions, so tests are not truly orthogonal.\n\nReply: RTI requires *sufficient* independence to make failure\u2010mode correlation improbable, not absolute independence.  Moreover, interactions can sometimes *increase* robustness: when critics from alien traditions engage, hidden common causes become explicit and can be varied.\n\nObjection 2: Overemphasis on independence neglects constructive theory virtues such as explanatory power or simplicity.\n\nReply: RTI is compatible with such virtues; indeed, independence across theoretical perspectives (e.g., thermodynamics vs. statistical mechanics) is itself a dimension of robustness.  What RTI claims is that, ceteris paribus, explanatory aesthetics without independence leave trust underdetermined.  Ptolemaic epicycles explained planetary motion elegantly for centuries; what eventually broke the stalemate were new dimensions of independence (telescopic observations, Newtonian mechanics).\n\nObjection 3: The model encourages expensive redundancy, slowing science.\n\nReply: RTI offers a *normative ideal*, not a blanket policy.  The marginal cost of additional independence must be balanced against stakes.  We rightly demand triple\u2010blind randomized trials for pharmaceuticals, but not for measuring room temperature before brewing coffee.  Objectivity, like trust, is context-sensitive.\n\n8. Advantages over the trust-as-definition view\n\n(i) Scalarity.  RTI yields a natural metric: count or weight independence dimensions.\n\n(ii) Diagnostic.  Failures become explicable\u2014e.g., early gravitational\u2010wave detections (1960s) lacked independence across instrumentation and analysis pipelines; trust proved unwarranted.\n\n(iii) Policy guidance.  When building regulatory science, RTI directs resources toward whichever independence dimension is currently weakest\u2014often social diversity in climate modelling, or methodological diversity in toxicology.\n\n9. New avenues: independence beyond the laboratory\n\nThe RTI model also illuminates debates about citizen science, AI-generated research, and \u201copen\u201d vs. proprietary datasets.\n\nCitizen science supplies social independence: volunteer classifiers in Galaxy Zoo lack the professional astronomer\u2019s career incentives, introducing a valuable orthogonal bias profile.\n\nAI systems, by contrast, can erode independence if multiple labs rely on the same pretrained model, covertly correlating errors.  RTI thus explains why \u201cmodel biodiversity\u201d is more than aesthetic\u2014it is an objectivity safeguard.\n\nOpen data catalyze independence by allowing analyses uncorrelated with the original team\u2019s statistical choices.  Proprietary data lock inquiry into a single error profile, shrinking objectivity space.\n\n10. Relationship to values\n\nDouglas famously argued that non-epistemic values are needed at the \u201cinductive risk\u201d stage.  RTI accommodates this by treating value diversity as just another independence dimension: let rival labs adopt different thresholds for type I vs. type II error; if conclusions converge, robustness is enhanced.  Hence RTI does not insulate science from values; it domesticates them within a framework that turns plurality into a reliability asset.\n\n11. A return to trust\n\nArmed with RTI we can now articulate the precise relation Fine and Douglas sought:\n\nScientific objectivity = independence-generated robustness.  \nTrust = a warranted doxastic or practical attitude toward claims exhibiting sufficient robustness for the context at hand.\n\nObjectivity is thus a *ground* of rational trust, not its synonym.  When the public asks, \u201cCan we trust the COVID-19 vaccine data?\u201d, the responsible answer points to independence dimensions: multiple manufacturers, heterogeneous trial populations, independent monitoring boards, open-access phase-3 reports.  Conversely, where independence is thin\u2014as in a single corporate toxicology study\u2014the modifier \u201cobjective\u201d should be withheld, signalling that trust would be premature.\n\n12. Conclusion\n\nDifferent senses of scientific objectivity do not float free in chaotic semantic space; they line up as specialized implementations of a single engineering principle: build independence into inquiry so that results become robust against the widest plausible range of error sources.  That principle, captured by the Robustness-Through-Independence model, explains why objective claims merit trust without collapsing the two notions.  It yields a scalar measure of objectivity, accounts for historical successes and failures, informs science policy, and turns the plurality of objectivity talk from an embarrassment into a systematic map.  If the model is correct, philosophers of science can retire the slogan \u201cobjectivity just means something we can trust\u201d in favor of a more precise counsel: to earn trust, make your results resilient across independent paths.  Objectivity is the architecture; trust is the warranted response when the architecture holds.", "output_tokens": 3339, "reasoning_tokens": 576}

A tempting way to hold the family together, suggested by Arthur Fine, Heather Douglas, and others, is to invoke trust: when we call something \u201cobjective,\u201d we signal that it can be trusted.  Though insightful, that formula is too coarse.  First, many things we in fact trust\u2014astrologers, charismatic leaders, the weather app\u2014are plainly not objective.  Second, the public sometimes distrusts highly objective results (think climate projections or vaccine safety trials).  So the relationship is more intricate than simple synonymy.\n\nThesis.  Scientific objectivity is not identical with trust, but functions as an *institutionally recognisable warrant for trust*.  What unifies the different senses of objectivity is that each specifies a mode of *illegitimate-dependence cancellation*: a set of procedural, statistical, or social mechanisms that insulate a claim from idiosyncratic perspectives, interests, or artefacts and therefore render *publicly* reasonable the attitude of epistemic trust.  Trust is the rationally appropriate response; objectivity is the engineered property that earns it.\n\nThe rest of the essay defends that thesis in six steps:\n\n1. A brief map of the main senses of objectivity.  \n2. A distinction between trust, reliability, and *assurance*.  \n3. The Dependency-Cancellation Model: objectivity as invariance under perspective-transformations.  \n4. Application: showing how procedural, convergent, and interactive objectivity instantiate the model.  \n5. Dialectical engagement with worries that the model either over-intellectualises trust or ignores power relations.  \n6. Pay-offs: why this supplies a clearer taxonomy, explains failures of public uptake, and suggests new research avenues.\n\n1.  A synoptic map\n\nMost taxonomies converge on three core senses.\n\na. Procedural (or \u201cmechanical\u201d) objectivity\u2014Baconian protocols, double-blind trials, standardised instruments.  Here the locus of objectivity is the *method*; the human investigator is constrained or even replaced.\n\nb. Convergent (or \u201cstatistical\u201d) objectivity\u2014replication, measurement of inter-rater reliability, meta-analysis.  The mark is robust agreement across independent trials.\n\nc. Interactive (or \u201csocial\u201d) objectivity\u2014Helen Longino\u2019s transformative criticism, peer review, interdisciplinary confrontation.  What matters are open venues where claims are exposed to diverse, rival perspectives.\n\nThere are further species\u2014structural objectivity (mathematical representation invariance), ontic objectivity (mind-independent existence)\u2014but the foregoing triplet suffices for present purposes.\n\n2.  Trust, reliability, assurance\n\nTo see the relationship we need sharper tools than the colloquial \u201ctrust.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Reliability is a first-order property: a thermometer\u2019s readings track ambient temperature with high frequency.  \n\u2022 Trust is a *second-order* attitude: *A* relies on *B* about *p* under some practical or epistemic stakes.  \n\u2022 Assurance (Hardin, Baier, and Jones emphasise this aspect) is the publicly available, defeasible evidence that makes *A\u2019s* trust in *B* rational.  It is what *B* can *point to* when pressed: transparent procedures, third-party audits, shared data.\n\nObjectivity, I claim, is best placed in the *assurance* slot.  It is a quality engineered into scientific practices that promises, and to a large extent delivers, reliability regardless of the particular identities, interests, or cognitive quirks of the participants.  Trust is the attitudinal uptake that should follow *if* one recognises the assurance as credible.\n\n3.  The Dependency-Cancellation Model\n\nConsider any scientific result R.  R is produced by a complex chain of dependencies: on instrumentation, background theory, funding priorities, personal biases, material circumstances, and sheer happenstance.  Call these collectively D.  An *illegitimate dependence* is a factor in D that makes R sensitive to an epistemically irrelevant variable\u2014a factor whose influence lowers the probability that R tracks the truth.  Objectivity is the property of having neutralised (cancelled, filtered, averaged away, symmetrised, or flagged) such illegitimate dependencies.\n\nMathematically, we can model this as a kind of invariance.  Let G be a group of transformations that encode the perspectives or interests we wish to screen off (e.g., swapping investigators, laboratories, time zones, political commitments).  R is objective with respect to G when the mapping from the world W to reported result R is *G-invariant*\u2014changing any parameter in G leaves R (or its evidential standing) unchanged.  That formal gloss unifies intuitive slogans like \u201cindependent of who does the measurement\u201d and \u201cperspective-independent\u201d under a single rubric.\n\nBecause illegitimate-dependence cancellation is usually costly (double-blind trials, multi-lab replications, open data infrastructures), possessing objectivity is socially informative: it publicly *signals* that R is safe to rely upon.  Hence the explanatory tie to trust.\n\n4.  How the senses fit the model\n\n4.1  Procedural objectivity.  In early nineteenth-century meteorology, readings were taken by citizen volunteers.  Observers reported wildly divergent barometric pressures, partly because mercury columns were read at eye-level angles that varied by height.  The solution was the Fortin barometer, designed with a vernier scale and mirror so that parallax error is mechanically removed\u2014the reading is invariant under the transformation \u201cobserver\u2019s eye position.\u201d  That exemplifies illegitimate-dependence cancellation, hence objectivity.\n\n4.2  Convergent objectivity.  The cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature has been measured by balloon-borne detectors, satellite radiometers, and ground telescopes.  Each method has distinct systematic errors, but they *converge* on 2.725 K.  Statistical concordance functions as cancellation of instrument-specific dependencies: no single apparatus need be infallible, because discrepancies cancel under aggregation.  The user need only trust that independent paths triangulate, something publicly demonstrable by data releases.\n\n4.3  Interactive objectivity.  Peer review sometimes fails, but its *function* is again dependency cancellation.  In 1989 Fleischmann and Pons announced \u201ccold fusion.\u201d  Their experiment lacked transparency; replication attempts quickly revealed uncontrolled variables (electrode surface roughness).  The broader community\u2019s critical interaction exposed a hidden dependence, revoking the warrant for trust.  Longino\u2019s emphasised \u201cuptake\u201d criterion\u2014do rivals take criticisms on board?\u2014is precisely a test of whether illegitimate dependence has been successfully neutralised.\n\nNote that under the Dependency-Cancellation Model the three senses are not disparate.  They correspond to (i) mechanical elimination of dependencies, (ii) probabilistic averaging of dependencies, and (iii) adversarial exposure of dependencies.  The unifier is *what is done to dependencies*, not *who performs which ritual*.\n\n5.  Dialectical engagement and objections\n\nObjection 1: Public distrust of vaccines or climate models persists despite high objectivity.  So objectivity cannot be an assurance sufficient for trust.\n\nReply.  The thesis is conditional: objectivity *warrants* trust for rational agents who recognise the assurance.  Sociological distrust may stem from failures of recognition (opacity, misinformation, politicisation).  The model actually illuminates such cases: if the public cannot *see* the dependency cancellation\u2014e.g., they see pharmaceutical funding as an unchecked influence\u2014they withhold trust.  Thus the remedy is not to reduce objectivity to trust, but to render the warrant legible.\n\nObjection 2: Feminist and post-Kuhnian scholars argue that power relations infiltrate what counts as \u201cillegitimate\u201d dependence.  Isn\u2019t the model question-begging?\n\nReply.  Two points.  First, the model is *agnostic* about which dependencies are to be cancelled; that is a normative decision open to contestation.  Second, the model actually provides the *space* in which such political critique is efficacious: calling attention to, say, gender bias in clinical studies is precisely a claim that an unrecognised dependence is illegitimate and should be neutralised (e.g., by including female subjects).  So the framework is not hostile but hospitable to critical epistemologies.\n\nObjection 3: Why not just equate objectivity with reliability and skip trust altogether?\n\nReply.  Because reliability is often opaque; agents need a *socially communicable* marker that signals reliability without them personally re-running the experiment.  Objectivity, being an overtly engineered property (double-blind protocols, open code, adversarial review), supplies that signal.  Hence the mediating role of assurance.\n\n6.  Pay-offs\n\n6.1  Clarified taxonomy.  By focusing on modes of dependency cancellation we can expand the list without losing unity: algorithmic objectivity (cancellation via pre-registered analysis scripts), ensembles (cancellation via model variety), and data provenance checkpoints (cancellation via traceable lineage) are recognisably cousins.\n\n6.2  Diagnostic tool.  When trust collapses\u2014e.g., replication crises\u2014we can ask: which dependencies slipped back in?  In psychology, p-hacking re-introduces experimenter degrees of freedom.  Registered Reports and multiverse analysis have emerged as new cancellation devices, restoring trust.\n\n6.3  Research program.  The invariance gloss connects philosophy of science to contemporary work in machine learning fairness (notoriously framed as invariance to protected attributes), causality (Pearl\u2019s do-calculus isolates illegitimate confounders), and statistics (design-based inference).  The overarching question\u2014what counts as the right group G and how do we test invariance empirically?\u2014is ripe for formal exploration.\n\nConclusion\n\nObjectivity, in all its guises, is best understood as an epistemic engineering solution to a social problem: how to make scientific results worthy objects of public trust even when producers and consumers are strangers, and even when interests diverge.  The solution is to identify, neutralise, and publicly display the neutralisation of illegitimate dependencies on perspective, interest, and accident.  Procedural, convergent, and interactive objectivity are not rival concepts but complementary strategies within that single project.  Trust, therefore, is not the basis of objectivity; rather, objectivity is the architected basis *for warranted trust*.  Getting the order right yields conceptual clarity, illuminates both historical practice and contemporary crises, and suggests concrete directions for strengthening the fragile contract between science and the societies that rely upon it.", "output_tokens": 3047, "reasoning_tokens": 768}

Trust by whom, in what, and on what grounds?  And does every sense of objectivity do the same sort of trust-work?  My aim is to supply the missing precision.  I shall defend the following thesis:\n\nThesis.  The disparate senses of scientific objectivity\u2014procedural, convergent, interactive, and so on\u2014are unified, not by the thin idea that they are \u201cthings to be trusted,\u201d but by the thicker idea that each provides a distinct, publicly inspectable mechanism for stabilizing defeasible epistemic trust.  Objectivity is best conceived functionally: it comprises any social-epistemic strategy that (i) insulates claims from idiosyncratic factors, (ii) makes the route from evidence to claim transparent to a critical community, and (iii) subjects the claim to independent checks capable of overturning it.  Procedural, convergent, and interactive objectivity realize this same trust-stabilizing function via different mechanisms.\n\nThis functional analysis explains both what the senses share and why they may pull apart in practice.  It also clarifies the normative complexion of \u201ctrust,\u201d showing why objectivity is an authority-conferring\u2014but always defeasible\u2014property rather than a metaphysical stamp of truth.\n\nI.  Locating the Puzzle\n\nFine and Douglas respond to the fragmentation of the term \u201cobjectivity\u201d in twentieth-century philosophy of science.  Starting with Hempel\u2019s thin hypothetico-deductivism, the concept proliferated: mechanical objectivity (Daston & Galison), statistical objectivity (Fisher), structural objectivity (Worrall), interactive objectivity (Douglas, Longino), and so on.  Rather than jettison the word, Fine and Douglas suggest that what scientists and publics really want is assurance.  If a result is objective, they say, we can rely on it.\n\nThe suggestion is plausible but underspecified.  Consider three worries.\n\n1.  Ambiguity:  \u201cTrust\u201d is a three-place relation (A trusts B with respect to C), but Fine and Douglas rarely say who is trusting whom for what.  Is it the scientific community trusting a procedure, or the lay public trusting the community?\n\n2.  Over-breadth:  We also trust elevators, spouses, and thermostats.  Does that make them objective?\n\n3.  Fragility:  Real-world trust may be misplaced\u2014think of fabricated data that nonetheless pass peer review.  Do we retroactively say the paper was objective because it was trusted, or deny objectivity despite the trust?\n\nThese worries suggest that \u201cobjectivity = trustworthiness\u201d needs refinement.  What we want is a criterion that links objectivity to warranted, not merely de facto, trust.\n\nII.  What Kind of Trust is at Issue?\n\nHardwig (1991) famously argued that modern science is irreducibly testimonial: no individual physicist can derive every datum she cites.  But Hardwig distinguishes mere reliability from trust.  To trust is (a) to place oneself vulnerably under another\u2019s control, while (b) holding a normative expectation that the other will fulfill an epistemic obligation.  Trust is thus not just belief in reliability; it involves entitlement and accountability.\n\nIn science the locus of vulnerability is uptake: the accepting audience must rely on a result without re-performing every experiment.  The corresponding obligation is that the producers of knowledge make their claim apt for independent critical appraisal.  Objectivity, I propose, is whatever satisfies that obligation in a way that can be audited by others.  Hence objectivity is not identical to trust but is a structured warrant for trust\u2014an epistemic architecture that converts individual vulnerability into socially distributed scrutiny.\n\nIII.  The Functional Core of Objectivity\n\nIf the foregoing is correct, then all genuine senses of objectivity should share a functional profile.  Let me formulate it precisely.\n\nA product X of inquiry is objective to the degree that:\n\n(i) Impersonality: X\u2019s derivation is sufficiently insulated from the idiosyncrasies (biases, interests, perceptual quirks) of particular agents.\n\n(ii) Transparency: The evidential and inferential route from data to X is recorded in a form that competent, interested others can inspect.\n\n(iii) Resilience: X is exposed to\u2014and survives\u2014probing by agents who employ at least partially independent routes of access to the same phenomenon.\n\nThese three dimensions jointly constitute what I shall call an epistemic trust infrastructure.  Each dimension targets a different failure mode of trust: (i) guards against distortion at the source, (ii) allows detection of honest mistakes, and (iii) protects against systematic bias or fraud that evades internal checks.\n\nIV.  Mapping the Standard Taxonomy onto the Functional Core\n\n1.  Procedural Objectivity.  Reliance on codified protocols (double-blind trials, pre-registration, standardized reagents) primarily realizes Impersonality.  By stipulating \u201cjust follow the recipe,\u201d we attempt to purge private judgement.  Yet procedural safeguards alone do little for Resilience: two labs might follow the same flawed protocol and replicate the same error.\n\n2.  Convergent Objectivity.  When multiple, independent lines of evidence point to the same conclusion (as with the existence of neutrinos or gravitational waves), we mainly secure Resilience.  Independence minimizes the chance that all lines share the same hidden defect.  But convergence alone does not guarantee Transparency; \u201cbig science\u201d results can be opaque to non-insiders.\n\n3.  Interactive Objectivity.  Longino, Douglas, and Kitcher emphasize critical interaction among diverse peers, especially those with differing background assumptions.  Such interaction fortifies both Transparency (through public airing of assumptions) and Resilience (through adversarial testing).  It is, however, parasitic on some minimal Procedural structure; conversation without data management soon decays into rhetoric.\n\nThe functional account therefore both unifies and differentiates.  Each type of objectivity is a partial implementation of the same trust-infrastructure, emphasising different dimensions.  In practice, mature scientific fields braid them together: consider the LIGO collaboration\u2019s detection of gravitational waves.  (i) Stringent calibration protocols addressed Impersonality; (ii) data and code were archived for community inspection, satisfying Transparency; (iii) the signal was extracted independently by two geographically separated detectors and re-analysed by competing teams, satisfying Resilience.  The community\u2019s resulting trust is not mysterious; it is underwritten by the interplay of all three dimensions.\n\nV.  Two Illustrative Cases\n\nCase 1:  Early 20th-Century Photo-Plate Astronomy.  Astronomers trusted photo-plates for their \u201cmechanical objectivity\u201d (Daston & Galison).  The plate appeared to satisfy Impersonality: no artistic hand could bias the image.  Yet as we learned with the supposed \u201ccanals\u201d on Mars, the trust was misplaced: optical artifacts created illusory lines that multiple astronomers \u201cverified.\u201d  The failure was a deficit in Resilience: independent telescopes using similar optics reproduced the same distortions.  The case shows why objectivity cannot be reduced to any single modality; the functional account predicts that missing dimensions undercut trustworthiness.\n\nCase 2:  COVID-19 Vaccine Trials.  Procedural safeguards (randomization, double-blinding), data transparency (public posting of trial protocols), and convergent evidence (phase III results from independent companies and countries) jointly generated sufficient public trust for emergency authorization.  Where publics doubted\u2014e.g., concerning rare blood-clot side-effects\u2014Regulators reopened Resilience tests (epidemiological surveillance independent of the manufacturers).  Again, the functional model explains both initial trust and later recalibration.\n\nVI.  Objections and Replies\n\nObjection 1:  \u201cSome objectively correct results (e.g., Mendel\u2019s laws) were not trusted for decades.  Does your account imply they were \u2018non-objective\u2019 until accepted?\u201d\n\nReply.  No.  Objectivity is an epistemic property, but trust is a social attitude that may or may not align with it.  My claim is that objectivity provides warrant for trust, not that it guarantees uptake.  Mendel\u2019s work lacked Resilience\u2014no independent replications existed\u2014so under my criterion it was indeed only weakly objective until later re-discoveries supplied the missing dimension.\n\nObjection 2:  \u201cCouldn\u2019t a charlatan simulate all three dimensions and still deceive the community?\u201d\n\nReply.  The possibility of sophisticated fraud (e.g., the Sch\u00f6n scandal in condensed-matter physics) shows that objectivity, like security, is defeasible.  But note how Sch\u00f6n was unmasked: inability of other labs to reproduce results (Resilience) and discrepancies in archived data (Transparency).  The functional model predicted exactly the points of failure.\n\nObjection 3:  \u201cYour three-fold test resembles reliability theories of justification.  What\u2019s new?\u201d\n\nReply.  Reliability theories focus on statistical frequency of truth.  I focus on normative accountability: objectivity as a socially organised right to be believed.  The addition of Transparency and Resilience captures distinctive social-epistemic obligations neglected by individualist reliabilism.\n\nVII.  Advantages over the Raw \u201cTrust\u201d Proposal\n\n1.  Precision.  We specify the mechanisms (impersonality, transparency, resilience) through which trust is warranted, avoiding the ambiguity of \u201cjust trust it.\u201d\n\n2.  Diagnostic Power.  We can explain partial objectivity, identify which dimension is lacking, and propose remedies.\n\n3.  Compatibility with Pluralism.  The account allows that different fields may emphasise different dimensions\u2014e.g., double-blind trials are ill-suited to paleontology\u2014but still participate in a common functional architecture.\n\n4.  Normative Modesty.  Objectivity remains defeasible: trust conferred today can be revoked tomorrow if new evidence shows a breach in any dimension.  This matches scientific practice better than absolutist accounts.\n\nVIII.  Relation to Existing Literature\n\nFine\u2019s \u201cNatural Ontological Attitude\u201d urged philosophers to abandon metaphysical debates about truth and instead observe what scientists treat as settled.  My view is sympathetic but adds a diagnostic toolkit: we can explain why the practices scientists use do, in fact, stabilize trust.  Douglas, for her part, argues that objectivity lies in \u201cmanaged values\u201d\u2014explicit articulation and critical examination of background assumptions.  Her notion maps neatly onto Transparency and Resilience in my model, revealing that managed values are one route to the functional goal.\n\nLongino\u2019s \u201ccritical contextual empiricism\u201d and Kitcher\u2019s \u201cideal deliberative democracy\u201d provide social blueprints that, again, vary chiefly in how they instantiate the three dimensions.  What I supply is the abstract function that these blueprints realize, showing why they count as variants of objectivity rather than competing replacements.\n\nIX.  Beyond Science: Civic Uptake\n\nA further benefit of the model is that it illuminates the fragile relation between scientific authority and public legitimacy.  Public mistrust often arises, not because laypersons doubt the raw data, but because they cannot see how Transparency or Resilience were satisfied.  Hence calls for \u201ccitizen audits\u201d of climate data or publicly accessible clinical-trial registries.  The model predicts that such measures, though sometimes costly, directly bolster the objectivity\u2014and hence the entitled trust\u2014of the resulting claims.\n\nX.  Conclusion\n\nScientific objectivity is not, at base, an occult property of theories or a mere honorific.  It is the name we give to a set of social-epistemic design strategies that stabilize defeasible trust by combining impersonality, transparency, and resilience.  Different historical senses of objectivity emphasize different strands of this braid, but their unity lies in performing the same functional role: converting individual vulnerability into public assurance without demanding impossible omniscience from any single knower.  Recognizing this unifying role clarifies why appeals to \u201cobjectivity\u201d remain indispensable in both scientific practice and public discourse, even as we refine\u2014and occasionally replace\u2014the particular mechanisms that warrant our trust.", "output_tokens": 3456, "reasoning_tokens": 832}

Introduction and Thesis\n\nScientists say a result is \u201cobjective\u201d when they wish to assure themselves, colleagues, regulators, or the wider public that the result can be relied upon. But what exactly is being promised? Arthur Fine speaks of \u201ctrustworthiness,\u201d while Heather Douglas claims that objectivity signifies \u201cthe potential to be trusted.\u201d Yet if objectivity were nothing more than trustworthiness, we could dispense with the extra word. I argue that objectivity names not the psychological attitude of trust, but a special set of epistemic conditions that render an attitude of trust rational for diverse, partially ignorant, and mutually monitoring agents. More precisely:\n\nThesis: The various senses of scientific objectivity (procedural, convergent, interactive, etc.) are unified by a single abstract property\u2014robust invariance under justified perspective\u2010shifts\u2014which, when fulfilled, provides public, second-order evidence that it is rational to trust a claim even if one lacks first-order acquaintance with the data or methods. Objectivity is therefore a higher-order assurance mechanism; trust is the fitting epistemic response once the underlying invariance conditions are met.\n\nI develop this thesis in four steps. Section 2 clarifies the major senses of objectivity and shows why \u201cbeing trustable\u201d is too coarse a unifier. Section 3 introduces the concept of robust invariance and shows how it underlies each sense. Section 4 addresses leading objections, including worries from feminist epistemology and radical constructivism. Section 5 concludes by distinguishing the proposed account from mere reliability and by sketching implications for scientific governance.\n\n2. What Needs Unifying? Three Canonical Senses of Scientific Objectivity\n\n2.1 Procedural Objectivity  \nIn measurement science, \u201cobjective\u201d often means that a prescribed procedure yields the same outcome regardless of who executes it. Thermometer readings, DNA sequencer outputs, and p-values all exemplify this sense. The procedure acts as a surrogate agent: follow the rules and you get the answer. Procedural objectivity thus eliminates, or at least neutralizes, idiosyncratic biases of individual investigators.\n\n2.2 Convergent (or Result) Objectivity  \nSometimes the procedure is contested, yet laboratories employing distinct techniques arrive at numerically compatible results (e.g., multiple estimates of Hubble\u2019s constant). Here objectivity is ascribed not to the method but to the stability of the phenomenon: independent routes converge on the same target. Philosophers call this robustness or triangulation.\n\n2.3 Interactive (or Social) Objectivity  \nHelen Longino and Douglas emphasize the critical dialogue in which hypotheses are subjected to scrutiny by a plurality of differently situated observers. What is objective in this sense is not an algorithmic recipe but a social process characterized by openness to criticism and the continual possibility of error detection.\n\nEach notion rightly picks out a dimension of epistemic security. But they look heterogeneous. Procedural objectivity is mechanical; convergent objectivity is empirical; interactive objectivity is social. Simply saying that all three \u201cgenerate trust\u201d is uninformative, because trust itself is an attitude that can arise from many unrelated causes\u2014habit, charisma, groupthink, or even coercion. We need a principled property that all three share, and that property must be one that in turn makes trust rational.\n\n3. Robust Invariance Under Justified Perspective-Shifts\n\n3.1 The Core Idea  \nObjectivity, I suggest, is best understood via a modal rather than a descriptive lens. A claim is objective to the extent that it remains stable when we justifiably alter epistemically incidental aspects of the perspective from which it is investigated. Perspectives are \u201cincidental\u201d when, according to our best background knowledge, they ought not affect the phenomenon if the claim is true. Examples: the identity of the experimenter, the particular measurement apparatus, the cultural background of the critic.\n\nFormally, let P be a proposition about the world and \u03a3 be the set of perspectives from which P is investigated. An investigation displays objectivity when, for each \u03c3\u2081, \u03c3\u2082 \u2208 \u03a3 such that transition from \u03c3\u2081 to \u03c3\u2082 is justified (i.e., does not introduce epistemically illicit factors), the probability of P given the evidence collected from \u03c3\u2081 is approximately the same as the probability of P given the evidence from \u03c3\u2082, within the margins dictated by existing uncertainty. Symbolically:  \nfor justified \u03c3\u2081\u2192\u03c3\u2082,  \n|Pr(P | E\u03c3\u2081) \u2212 Pr(P | E\u03c3\u2082)| < \u03b5.\n\nProcedural, convergent, and interactive objectivity are then special cases of perspective shifts:\n\n\u2022 Procedural: \u03c3 encodes the individual experimenter; shifting \u03c3 replaces Alice with Bob.  \n\u2022 Convergent: \u03c3 encodes the experimental apparatus; shifting replaces calorimetry with spectroscopy.  \n\u2022 Interactive: \u03c3 encodes the critic\u2019s background assumptions; shifting replaces one critical community with another.\n\n3.2 Why Invariance Grounds Rational Trust  \nTrust, in the epistemic sense relevant here, is a disposition to accept a claim on another\u2019s say-so while forgoing replication and detailed scrutiny. Such trust is rational when one has higher-order evidence that the claim would survive a wide range of justified perspective-shifts. In other words, invariance furnishes a public signal that private vetting is likely to reach the same result, which is precisely the practical function of objectivity talk.\n\nNotice that on this account objectivity is not identical with reliability. A thermometer may be reliable yet fail objectivity if only a single operator can use it correctly (czarist reliability). Conversely, a deliberately adversarial process\u2014such as double-blind trials\u2014can be objective even when individual measurement steps are subject to noise, provided the same outcome re-emerges across shifts.\n\n3.3 Illustration: Quantifying Gene Expression  \nConsider two labs measuring the expression of a notoriously finicky gene. Lab A uses quantitative PCR, Lab B uses RNA-Seq. If results converge within error bars, the claim that the gene is upregulated exhibits robust invariance across instrumentation shifts. Moreover, if the same result is obtained when the data are processed by an independent statistician who does not know which condition is control and which is treatment (blinded reanalysis), the result survives an epistemic\u2010interest shift. The multiplicity of justified shifts over which invariance is maintained produces the second-order signal that the result can be trusted even by biologists who never touch the raw data.\n\n4. Objections and Replies\n\n4.1 The Feminist Critique: Whose Justification?  \nLongino and others may object that what counts as a \u201cjustified\u201d perspective-shift is itself politically laden. If only male, Western, or industry-funded perspectives are deemed legitimate, the invariance criterion could mask rather than mitigate bias.\n\nReply: The account accommodates this worry by incorporating pluralistic justification conditions. A perspective-shift is justified only if excluding it would be epistemically arbitrary relative to the phenomenon. For example, feminist standpoint theories show that some biases in drug trials are revealed only when pregnant bodies are included as legitimate test subjects. Under my account, excluding the pregnant\u2010body perspective would itself break invariance, thereby defeating objectivity. Hence a social check on what counts as a permissible \u03c3 is baked into the model, not an external add-on.\n\n4.2 Radical Constructivism: No View From Nowhere  \nConstructivists argue that every perspective is contextually entrenched; therefore, invariance across shifts merely tracks entrenched conventions.\n\nReply: The proposal does not seek a \u201cview from nowhere.\u201d Instead, it asks: given the conventions we do share\u2014logical competence, basic experimental controls, mutual intelligibility\u2014does the claim withstand justified re-parameterizations? Constructivists rightly remind us that our set \u03a3 can never be total. Still, partial but progressive enlargement of \u03a3 is the historical hallmark of improving objectivity: think of Pasteur introducing sterile technique as a new \u03c3, or 20th-century physicists adding space-based observatories. On pain of self-undermining, the constructivist too must recognize some stability across contexts; otherwise her own pronouncements could not persuade across audiences.\n\n4.3 The Value\u2010Ladenness of Trust  \nDouglas holds that values unavoidably permeate science, so objectivity cannot be value neutrality. Does invariance smuggle neutrality in through the back door?\n\nReply: No. Values may legitimately guide which perspective-shifts we deem important. Anthropogenic climate change models incorporate value\u2010laden decisions about which forcings to prioritize. Yet once such decisions become explicit, the resulting models can be subjected to perspective shifts along other axes (research group, statistical estimator, emission scenario). Objectivity does not require value vacuuming; it demands only transparency and invariant signal across the admitted value spectrum.\n\n5. Distinguishing Objectivity From Reliability, Consensus, and Authority\n\nThe invariance account clarifies confusions that plague public debates:\n\n\u2022 Reliability is a property of a single process in actual\u2010world conditions; objectivity concerns how results vary under counterfactual shifts. A lie detector might be 95 % reliable yet completely non-objective, because its accuracy plummets if the operator is unaware of subject ethnicity.\n\n\u2022 Consensus is sociological; objectivity is epistemic. A unanimous but echo\u2010chambered community may reach consensus without meeting invariance tests, whereas heated dissent can coexist with objectivity if each side\u2019s best arguments yield a narrow outcome range.\n\n\u2022 Authority is vertical; objectivity is horizontal. Authority asks, \u201cWho says so?\u201d Objectivity asks, \u201cWould the same thing be said by different yet epistemically positioned others?\u201d\n\n6. Practical Payoff: Designing Institutions for Objectivity\n\nThe account suggests concrete institutional levers:\n\n6.1 Adversarial Collaboration  \nJournals can require adversarial replications by methodological opponents before labeling findings \u201cconfirmed.\u201d This induces perspective shifts by design.\n\n6.2 Registered Multi-Method Reports  \nBeyond preregistration, journals could mandate parallel protocols using distinct techniques (e.g., behavioral assays plus neural imaging). Objectivity then accrues when both converge.\n\n6.3 Diversity Audits  \nFunding agencies can audit whether the set \u03a3 of perspectives explored in a project is sufficiently heterogeneous relative to the phenomenon. Missing perspectives signal potential objectivity gaps.\n\n7. Conclusion\n\nScientific objectivity is not a synonym for trust, nor even for trustworthiness in the blanket sense. Rather, objectivity is the property of a claim or process that renders rational a policy of trust by demonstrating stability across justified perspective-shifts. Procedural, convergent, and interactive objectivity are complementary operationalizations of this deeper invariance relation.\n\nBy recasting objectivity in modal terms, we resolve Fine and Douglas\u2019s insight\u2014\u201cobjective\u201d earns its honorific by being something one can trust\u2014without collapsing the conceptual distinction between the property trusted and the attitude of trust. We also illuminate why objectivity, unlike mere reliability or consensus, can be contested, refined, and extended as scientific practice evolves. Future philosophical work might formalize the topology of perspective space \u03a3 and quantify \u03b5-tolerances for different disciplines, thereby turning the present conceptual analysis into a guide for empirical epistemology and science policy alike.\n\n\u2248 2,030 words", "output_tokens": 2767, "reasoning_tokens": 384}

Introduction and Thesis  \nPhilosophers as different as Arthur Fine, Lorraine Daston, and Heather Douglas agree on a slogan: calling a result \u201cobjective\u201d is a way of saying we can trust it. The slogan is apt, but it is also vague: people trust spouses, banks, and dogs in very different senses; equating \u201cis objective\u201d with \u201ccan be trusted\u201d threatens to dissipate both notions into comforting platitudes. I argue that objectivity and trust are related not by conceptual identity but by functional dependence. A scientific product is objective when it is generated by practices deliberately designed to manage and localize epistemic error in such a way that its acceptance does not depend on anyone\u2019s idiosyncratic traits. That error-management function, when publicly legible, makes it rational\u2014though never automatic\u2014to extend epistemic trust to the product and, derivatively, to the community that vouches for it. The unity across the usual taxonomies of objectivity (procedural, convergent, interactive, et al.) is precisely their realization of the same underlying error-management property by different social-technical means. Put in one sentence: objectivity is idiosyncrasy-insensitive reliability; warranted trust is the disposition to rely on outputs known to possess that property.\n\n2. Unpacking \u201cTrust\u201d  \nStart with clarity about what \u201ctrust\u201d could mean in a scientific context.\n\na. Interpersonal vs. Institutional Trust. The paradigm case of trust is interpersonal: I leave my child with you because I believe you are competent and well-intentioned, and I would resent betrayal. But scientists rarely meet their audiences; what is trusted is usually an institution (the CDC), a procedure (double-blind trials), or a material product (a temperature record).\n\nb. Reliance vs. Entrustment. One can rely on a ladder without \u201ctrusting\u201d it in the interpersonal sense; only agents can betray. Still, trust in science is not mere reliance. Citizens often feel resentment or indignation when scientific advice fails, indicating that a normative relationship\u2014though diffuse\u2014is in play.\n\nc. Epistemic Trust. Following Karen Jones and Onora O\u2019Neill, epistemic trust can be analyzed as a three-place relation: S trusts C regarding proposition p when S (i) relies on C\u2019s competence and honesty about p, and (ii) assumes C is accountable for inaccuracies. Institutional epistemic trust is thus possible: I trust NIST to state the length of a meter because its calibration procedures systematically root out individual error and because the institute stands behind its claims.\n\nThese clarifications show that \u201ctrust\u201d in science is neither purely interpersonal nor purely mechanical. It is a socially distributed normative reliance: one stakes practical or cognitive projects on the integrity of a complex system.\n\n3. What Objectivity Is Not  \nIf objectivity simply meant \u201cis trusted,\u201d Fine\u2019s slogan would hold by definition. But we routinely distinguish objective claims from trusted ones: astrology books are trusted by some but considered subjective; conversely, an experimental result may be objective even before the public comes to trust it. So the relationship is asymmetric: objectivity warrants trust, not vice versa.\n\nNor does objectivity require freedom from values, perspectives, or theory-ladenness. A climate model may be \u201cobjective\u201d despite value-laden choices of variables, so long as these choices are constrained by transparent criteria that let independent modelers reproduce or critique the result. Thus, objectivity must be keyed to the management of error and bias rather than their total elimination.\n\n4. The Idiosyncrasy-Insensitivity Criterion  \nMy proposal is that the core of scientific objectivity is idiosyncrasy-insensitive reliability:\n\nAn epistemic product O addressing question Q is objective to degree d when, for a wide range of competent agents A, B, \u2026 who employ an approved set of practices P, the outputs o_A, o_B, \u2026 satisfy |o_A \u2013 o_B| < \u03b5, where \u03b5 is the tolerance fixed by the aims of inquiry.\n\nLess formally: a result is objective if differences among individual investigators\u2014beliefs, interests, sensorimotor quirks, or moral stakes\u2014make no systematic difference to the outcome beyond an agreed tolerance. Objectivity lives in the resilience of outputs under socially irrelevant variations.\n\n5. Error-Management as the Unifying Function  \nWhy does idiosyncrasy-insensitivity matter? Because it is the hallmark of successful error management. Sources of error\u2014instrument drift, motivational bias, coding slip, selective reporting\u2014are typically idiosyncratic. Practices that cancel, track, or spatially locate such errors produce outputs stable across independent implementations.\n\nThis error-management function unifies the usual senses of objectivity:\n\n\u2022 Procedural objectivity (Daston & Galison\u2019s paradigmatic \u201cmechanical objectivity\u201d) uses standardized protocols, checklists, and calibration routines to ensure that if two agents follow the same procedure, their idiosyncrasies wash out.\n\n\u2022 Convergent objectivity (Fine) secures agreement via multiple independent investigative routes. If distinct pathways arrive at the same estimate of the Hubble constant, uncorrelated errors are likely cancelled.\n\n\u2022 Interactive objectivity (Douglas) embeds critical dialogue and peer review so that socially diverse interlocutors expose each other\u2019s blind spots, again making the output less sensitive to any one perspective.\n\n\u2022 Measurement objectivity in metrology is institutionalized as \u201ctraceability\u201d: every step, from shop-floor sensor to primary standard, records uncertainties so that cumulative error is bounded and localized.\n\nThe surface mechanics differ, but the telos is the same: systematically police idiosyncratic error.\n\n6. From Objectivity to Warranted Trust  \nOnce the public (or downstream scientists) have good reason to believe that a result is idiosyncrasy-insensitively reliable, they acquire equally good reason to trust it epistemically. The chain of justification looks thus:\n\n(i) Knowledge that procedures P enforce error control \u2192  \n(ii) Justified belief that o is robust across competent implementations \u2192  \n(iii) Justified expectation that o will not mislead practical or cognitive projects \u2192  \n(iv) Rational disposition to rely on o and to hold its producers accountable.\n\nHence, objectivity is the primary ground for warranted trust. Trust is therefore parasitic on, but conceptually distinct from, objectivity.\n\n7. Illustrative Cases  \n\nCase 1: Forensic Bite-Mark Analysis (Failure). For decades, U.S. courts treated bite-mark comparisons as objective expert testimony. Yet no standardized metrics existed; results varied wildly by examiner. The practice lacked idiosyncrasy-insensitivity. Once that was revealed, trust dissolved overnight. The sequence shows that public trust was misplaced precisely because objectivity was absent.\n\nCase 2: Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). Detection claims had to survive elaborate vetting: duplicate interferometers at Hanford and Livingston, time-stamped \u201cblind injections\u201d to test data pipelines, and open release of waveforms. These layered defenses make the signal insensitive to the quirks of any one instrument or analyst. Accordingly, global trust in gravitational-wave astronomy formed rapidly despite the exotic nature of the phenomenon.\n\nCase 3: Global Mean Surface Temperature (GMST). NASA\u2019s GISTEMP, HadCRUT, and Berkeley Earth use different data cleaning algorithms and station selections. The fact that their curves converge within margins\u2014even while entertaining open-sourced criticism\u2014underwrites public trust far better than any press release could.\n\n8. Dialectical Engagement  \nWhat of radical constructivists who deny the possibility of idiosyncrasy-free knowledge? Or feminist epistemologists who warn that power structures pervade \u201cobjective\u201d science?\n\nFirst, the criterion is gradational: idiosyncrasy-insensitivity admits of degrees and domains. Absolute neutrality is not required; only that residual dependencies be acknowledged and managed. That positions my account as a middle ground: more realist than social constructivism, but more socially sensitive than naive realism.\n\nSecond, the feminist insight that marginalized standpoints reveal concealed assumptions is accommodated by interactive objectivity. Enlarging the pool of competent agents A, B, \u2026 broadens the range of idiosyncrasies tested, increasing objectivity, not threatening it. Hence, the real disagreement shifts from \u201cCan objectivity exist?\u201d to \u201cHow should communities be structured to maximize it?\u201d\u2014a fruitful reframing.\n\nThird, the constructivist can still accept that some procedures reduce error without invoking a metaphysics of mind-independent \u201cfacts.\u201d The present account is compatible with a pragmatist or empiricist stance: what matters is reliable prediction and coordination, not correspondence in an inaccessible sense.\n\n9. Precision of Distinctions  \nMy proposal distinguishes four often-blurred items:\n\na. Objectivity (property of outputs) vs. Objectification (treatment of phenomena as passive).  \nb. Reliability (statistical performance) vs. Idiosyncrasy-insensitive reliability (performance robust to irrelevant agent variation).  \nc. Trust (normative reliance) vs. Mere Confidence (psychological feeling).  \nd. Individual Bias (cognitive) vs. Structural Bias (institutional incentive).  \n\nThese distinctions allow us to say, for instance, that a pharmaceutical company\u2019s trial protocol might be procedurally objective yet still vulnerable to structural bias if contract terms suppress null results. Objectivity is necessary but not always sufficient for trust.\n\n10. Formal Sketch  \nTo sharpen intuition, consider a simple model. Let f: S \u00d7 P \u2192 \u211d be the mapping from scientist S following practice P to numeric output. Define variance V_P = Var_S(f(S,P)). P is objective relative to tolerance \u03b5 when V_P \u2264 \u03b5. Different senses of objectivity manipulate V_P via different knobs:\n\n\u2022 Procedural: restrict S\u2019s degrees of freedom by tightening P;  \n\u2022 Convergent: keep P fixed but pool outputs of multiple P_i such that Cov_Pi,Pj \u2248 0;  \n\u2022 Interactive: iteratively update P to cancel correlated errors revealed in discourse.\n\nThe mathematical expression makes explicit why trust scales inversely with V_P, all else equal.\n\n11. Advantages over Existing Accounts  \nThe error-management account improves on Fine\u2019s \u201ctrust\u201d slogan by supplying (i) a property scientists can aim to maximize; (ii) metrics\u2014variance, robustness, traceability\u2014that practitioners already use; and (iii) an explanation of why different conceptions of objectivity feel unified despite surface diversity.\n\nIt also clarifies puzzles such as why computer simulations, once dismissed as \u201cvirtual,\u201d gain objectivity when cross-validated against analytic solutions and empirical data: cross-validation lowers idiosyncratic error.\n\n12. Objections and Replies  \n\nObjection 1: Some domains (e.g., paleontology) cannot replicate results; yet their claims can still be objective.  \nReply: Idiosyncrasy-insensitivity need not rely on literal replication. Multiple lines of evidence (bone histology, sedimentology, phylogenetics) provide convergence; the account generalizes beyond laboratory replication.\n\nObjection 2: What about intentional deception? A forged dataset could satisfy low variance across duped analysts.  \nReply: Deception undermines accountability, which is part of what makes the error-management practices publicly legible. Once fraud is possible only because the deception mimics objectivity, the account explains both ordinary success and extraordinary failure modes.\n\nObjection 3: Engineering tolerances (\u03b5) are interest-relative; this re-introduces subjectivity.  \nReply: Yes, \u03b5 is chosen relative to aims. But once fixed, whether a procedure meets \u03b5 is not further interest-relative. Objectivity is relative but not arbitrary\u2014reflecting both epistemic virtues and practical stakes.\n\n13. Consequences and Research Directions  \nAdopting the error-management view suggests empirical research programs:\n\n\u2022 Sociometric analysis: Which configurations of diversity maximize idiosyncrasy-insensitivity in team science?  \n\u2022 Algorithmic transparency: Can we quantify a model\u2019s objective status via perturbation tests analogous to adversarial robustness in AI?  \n\u2022 Institutional design: How do funding and peer-review structures modulate structural bias without compromising procedural objectivity?\n\nSuch projects tie philosophical analysis to actionable reforms\u2014precisely the payoff of reframing objectivity around error management.\n\n14. Conclusion  \nScientific objectivity is not a mystical virtue nor merely a sociological label for whatever commands assent. It is a measurable, improvable property: the degree to which a result is insensitive to the idiosyncrasies of those who produced it thanks to deliberate, publicly checkable error-management strategies. When the public or fellow scientists justifiably know that such strategies are in place and effective, they acquire grounds for epistemic trust. The multiplicity of \u201cobjectivities\u201d\u2014procedural, convergent, interactive\u2014are best viewed as complementary engineering solutions to the same design problem: how to build knowledge that anyone, anywhere, can use without deference to personalities, hierarchies, or local quirks. Recognizing that unity both sharpens the notion of objectivity and places trust on its proper conceptual footing: as an earned response to the systematic domestication of error.", "output_tokens": 3308, "reasoning_tokens": 512}

INTRODUCTION  \n\nFor two centuries \u201cobjectivity\u201d has functioned as the talisman of modern science. Yet philosophers who have tried to cash out the term analytically have ended up with a bewildering list of species: mechanical, procedural, statistical, convergent, interactive, regulative, ontological, and more.  Arthur Fine and, more recently, Heather Douglas have offered an attractively simple unifier: in every register, to call a result objective is to say it can be trusted.  Their slogan occupies an intuitive middle ground between the \u201cview from nowhere\u201d of nineteenth-century positivism and the pluralist or feminist complaints that all knowledge is situated.  Still, \u201cobjectivity = trustworthiness\u201d is obviously too quick: trust is an attitude we take toward people and institutions, not a property of claims or methods; moreover, people trust what does not deserve it and mistrust what does.  If we want an account that explains why some practices merit trust and others do not, we need a sharper tool.\n\nThesis.  The different senses of scientific objectivity share a single normative function: they are complementary strategies for underwriting what I shall call transferable epistemic reliance.  A result is objective, in any sense, insofar as (i) it can withstand critical scrutiny from differently situated inquirers and (ii) it supplies publicly traceable reasons that license those others to rely on it in their own reasoning and action.  \u201cTrust\u201d is therefore not the basis of objectivity; rather, warranted trust is the attitude we are entitled to adopt once a claim possesses this dual property of robustness-under-scrutiny and public traceability.  The various sub-types of objectivity\u2014procedural, convergent, interactive, etc.\u2014turn out to be distinct design-solutions to the same engineering problem: how to make scientific outputs stable under ever-broader ranges of potential dissensus while keeping their justificatory pedigree inspectable.\n\nThe argument proceeds in six steps.  (\u00a72) I first rehearse the influential \u201cobjectivity as trustworthiness\u201d proposals and isolate the ambiguity that motivates revision.  (\u00a73) I extract from historical practice two dimensions\u2014robustness and traceability\u2014that together ground reliable inter-person transfer, and I formalize them in a single notion: publicly defeasible warrant.  (\u00a74) I show how the main catalogued senses of objectivity each secure one or both dimensions, thereby displaying an underlying unity.  (\u00a75) I explain how warranted trust emerges as a downstream interpersonal attitude, relating this to recent work in the second-personal epistemology of authority.  (\u00a76) I confront three families of objections (post-truth distrust, feminist standpoint worries, and the possibility of \u201cobjective yet not-trusted\u201d results) to demonstrate dialectical adequacy.  (\u00a77) A trio of concrete examples (double-blind clinical trials, multi-model climate ensembles, and forensic fingerprint reform) illustrates the pay-off.  (\u00a78) I close by indicating research avenues opened by the \u201ctransferable reliance\u201d account.\n\n2. WHY \u201cOBJECTIVITY = TRUST\u201d IS TOO COARSE  \n\nArthur Fine\u2019s Natural Ontological Attitude (NOA) urged that we do no more than \u201ctake science on trust.\u201d  Heather Douglas, responding to values-in-science debates, writes that objectivity is \u201cthat property that makes scientific knowledge the sort of thing we can reasonably trust.\u201d  Both authors correctly emphasize that objectivity matters because science is a collective enterprise marked by epistemic dependence: no individual can replicate the PCR analyses, build the particle accelerator, and run the epidemiological models unaided.  Still, two ambiguities lurk.\n\nA. Epistemic versus Interpersonal Trust.  I may \u201ctrust\u201d the London Underground map as a navigational aid, my laboratory technician with handling reagents, or my friend to keep a confidence.  Only the first two are relevant to objectivity, but they differ: the map is an artefact; the technician is an agent.  Collapsing these invites category mistakes.\n\nB. Trustworthiness versus Trustedness.  Climate scientists have produced convergent evidence for anthropogenic warming, yet substantial publics do not trust them.  Conversely, investors trusted Elizabeth Holmes\u2019s blood-testing machines despite their lack of objectivity.  Any successful theory must explain how objectivity can ground warranted trust even when actual trust is misplaced.\n\nBecause Fine and Douglas articulate the needed social norm while leaving these distinctions blurry, they give us direction but not a map.  The next section proposes the missing structure.\n\n3. TRANSFERABLE RELIANCE: ROBUSTNESS + TRACEABILITY  \n\nWe start with the everyday phenomenon of epistemic outsourcing.  A city engineer wishes to rely on a soil-chemistry report produced by a commercial lab; a physician wishes to rely on a Cochrane meta-analysis; an ordinary citizen wishes to rely on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).  What properties must the report, the meta-analysis, or the IPCC assessment possess to make such reliance reasonable for parties who lack time or expertise to reproduce the work?  \n\nPhilosophers of science and STS scholars have, piece by piece, answered:  \n\n1. Elimination of idiosyncrasy (through standardized protocols, double-blind procedures, mechanized detection, mandatory disclosure of conflicts).  \n2. Plurality of independent evidential routes (convergence, replication, triangulation).  \n3. Open arenas for critique and revision (peer review, post-publication commentary, adversarial collaborations).  \n4. Records that expose the lineage of data and decisions (method sections, green-open notebooks, version control).  \n\nNotice the pattern: each requirement makes the product stable under the insertion of additional perspectives.  Yet stability isn\u2019t enough; the user must also be able to *see* why the product is stable\u2014hence the emphasis on recorded provenance and open criticism.  Put schematically:\n\nRobustness Condition (R): The warrant for p is preserved across a relevant range of counterfactual contexts\u2014different observers, instruments, background assumptions.\n\nTraceability Condition (T): The epistemic route from evidence to p is publicly inspectable, so that potential dissenters can diagnose where agreement should break down if it is to break down at all.\n\nI call the conjunction of (R) and (T) publicly defeasible warrant (PDW).  \u201cDefeasible\u201d because the justification is always open to being overturned by new considerations; \u201cpublicly\u201d because the materials for overturning are not the private property of the original inquirers.  PDW furnishes what other agents need in order to *transfer* reliance from their own direct inquiry to the testimony, model, or protocol in question.  Objectivity, on this proposal, is the property of possessing PDW relative to a domain of users and a horizon of conceivable challenges.  \n\nTwo immediate virtues: (i) PDW is not an attitude but a property of the epistemic product and its production-history, avoiding category mistakes; (ii) PDW underwrites *warranted* trust, leaving space for misplaced trust or unwarranted suspicion.\n\n4. HOW THE VARIETIES OF OBJECTIVITY REALIZE PDW  \n\nWe can now unify the canonical sub-types.\n\n4.1 Procedural Objectivity.  Daston and Galison\u2019s nineteenth-century \u201cmechanical objectivity\u201d mandated that the scientist remove active judgment via devices like the camera lucida.  Today, the double-blind randomized controlled trial plays the same role.  By algorithmically constraining human discretion, such procedures raise robustness (they block idiosyncratic bias) and enhance traceability (the rules are explicit, so outsiders can audit compliance).\n\n4.2 Convergent Objectivity.  When measurements obtained by distinct methods (e.g., radar, optical, gravitational) yield the same value for the Hubble constant, robustness is maximized: any method-specific error would have to occur identically across routes, an increasingly improbable coincidence.  Traceability is supplied by comparative method publications.\n\n4.3 Interactive Objectivity.  Longino\u2019s \u201ctransformative criticism\u201d and Douglas\u2019s \u201ccritical interaction\u201d stress that diverse social perspectives ferret out background assumptions.  Peer review, replication failures, and community epistemic norms thus elevate robustness (by exposing hidden dependence) and traceability (the back-and-forth is recorded in journals, preprints, blogs).\n\n4.4 Numerical/Statistical Objectivity.  Statistical frameworks (confidence intervals, Bayesian posteriors) encode quantified uncertainty in publicly inspectable form, satisfying (T), and promote (R) by modeling variability across samples and model choices.\n\nAll remaining varieties can be analyzed in the same way.  What looked like a taxonomic jungle is an engineer\u2019s toolbox: different gears mesh to produce PDW under different threat-models (bias, noise, under-determination, inductive risk).  The unity lies in the goal of transferable reliance.\n\n5. FROM OBJECTIVITY TO WARRANTED TRUST  \n\nIf PDW grounds objectivity, where does trust enter?  Karen Jones defines trust in the epistemic realm as \u201cthe optimistic stance that the trusted will take one\u2019s epistemic interests as reasons.\u201d  That stance is warranted when the object possesses PDW because:  \n\n(i) The user knows that any reasonable objection she could have raised has *in principle already been raised* by someone in the critical community (R).  \n(ii) She can, if needed, access the chain of reasoning and data herself (T).  \n\nThus PDW is a *reason* to adopt the optimistic stance\u2014even if she never exercises the option of auditing.  Importantly, trust is now second-personal and relational: my warranted reliance on the IPCC arises because I stand in a normative relation to the assembled authors who, by following PDW-securing procedures, have undertaken a public epistemic commitment.  This dovetails with recent work (McMyler, Hinchman) on the authority of testimony: by satisfying PDW, the scientist offers a recognizably legitimate illocutionary act of \u201ctelling.\u201d  Objectivity is therefore not the same thing as trust, but it is the *enabler* of justified trust in a complex social epistemology.\n\n6. OBJECTIONS AND REPLIES  \n\n6.1 The Post-Truth Challenge: \u201cBut many still do not trust objective science.\u201d  \nReply: PDW distinguishes *trustworthiness* from actual public uptake.  Obstacles to uptake (political polarization, disinformation, cognitive biases) impede the transmission of trust, not the property that warrants it.  The account even diagnoses why science communication efforts focus on transparency and replication: these make PDW *visible*, easing uptake.\n\n6.2 The Standpoint Critique: \u201cObjectivity as PDW still centers dominant perspectives.\u201d  \nReply: PDW actually vindicates feminist concerns.  Robustness demands exposure to a *range* of counterfactual contexts; marginalized perspectives supply precisely the alternative vantage points that detect blind spots.  Interactive objectivity is incomplete absent standpoint pluralism.  PDW therefore requires, not denies, epistemic inclusion.\n\n6.3 Objective but Untrusted Results?  Suppose a lab achieves PDW but withholds its notebook; insiders vouch for its integrity, but outsiders cannot see.  Are the results objective?  According to PDW, traceability fails, so full objectivity is absent.  The lab\u2019s colleagues may trust on personal ties, but the broader community lacks warrant.  The apparent counter-example thus reinforces, rather than threatens, the analysis.\n\n7. THREE ILLUSTRATIVE CASES  \n\nCase 1: Double-Blind Randomized Controlled Trials (DB-RCTs) in drug approval.  \nProcedural constraints (randomization, blinding, intention-to-treat analyses) block physician expectation effects (R).  Pre-registration and data-sharing platforms (T) let external regulators and meta-analysts audit results.  The FDA\u2019s reliance on such trials exemplifies transferable reliance: clinicians and patients need not re-run the experiment; PDW is outsourced through the protocol.\n\nCase 2: Multi-Model Climate Ensembles (MMEs).  \nEach model encodes different parameterizations and assumptions; convergence across MMEs secures robustness.  Publicly archived code, forcing data, and uncertainty spreadsheets secure traceability.  Consequently, policymakers can treat the ensemble-mean projection as a trustworthy basis for costly adaptation decisions.\n\nCase 3: Reform of Forensic Fingerprinting.  \nTraditional fingerprint analysis relied on expert intuition.  After wrongful convictions, the forensic community introduced standard counting rules, proficiency testing, and blind verification.  These interventions increase robustness (less expert drift) and traceability (audit trails), moving the practice from subjective artistry toward epistemic objectivity\u2014and thereby restoring court-room trust.\n\nThe cases show that PDW not only unifies philosophical senses of objectivity but guides real-world institutional design.\n\n8. CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK  \n\nScientific objectivity, long caricatured as a metaphysical \u201cview from nowhere,\u201d is better understood as an ensemble of practical techniques aimed at a social-epistemic end: making knowledge *portable* among agents who must rely on one another at a distance.  The portable state is achieved when results display Publicly Defeasible Warrant\u2014robustness across counterfactual perspectives plus a traceable justificatory path.  Trust, in turn, is the warranted second-personal attitude licensed by PDW, not its definitional core.  \n\nThis reframing suggests several research programs.  First, quantitative metrics of robustness and traceability could help agencies like the IPCC prioritize uncertainties.  Second, PDW clarifies why open-science reforms matter: without machine-readable traceability, AI-driven meta-analyses may inherit unnoticed biases.  Third, PDW offers a normative benchmark for emerging citizen-science collaborations: diversifying perspectives increases robustness only if accompanied by data provenance infrastructure that secures traceability.\n\nIn sum, objectivity and trust are indeed connected, but the connection is mediated by the social-epistemic architecture of science.  Once we focus on the engineering goal of transferable reliance, the proliferating species of objectivity reveal themselves as integrated components of a single reliability-enhancing design.  That insight, I submit, both honors the complexity of scientific practice and gives us a clearer compass for navigating the politics of knowledge in an age of epistemic interdependence.", "output_tokens": 3571, "reasoning_tokens": 576}

Fine\u2019s and Douglas\u2019s slogan\u2014\u201cwe call it objective when we can trust it\u201d\u2014captures an important sociological fact: scientists and laypersons alike invoke \u201cobjectivity\u201d largely to signal that reliance is warranted.  Yet the aphorism threatens to collapse two conceptually distinct items.  Trust is a *psychological-normative* attitude of one agent toward another (or toward a product); objectivity is an *epistemic-methodological* achievement of a process or body of claims.  Sweeping them together courts category mistakes.  What we need is a theory that (1) keeps the kinds of thing squarely apart, yet (2) explains why they predictably travel together, and (3) shows how the various familiar senses of objectivity\u2014procedural, interactive, convergent, and so on\u2014are unified under that explanation.\n\nTHESIS.  The unifying core of scientific objectivity is *idiosyncrasy-blocking public checkability*: an objective procedure, result, or model is one whose evidential warrant does not depend on commitments that are epistemically opaque or idiosyncratic to any particular person or sub-group, because the process incorporates mechanisms that (i) make every material step publicly inspectable and (ii) render the output robust under a diversity of independent avenues of interrogation.  Because such mechanisms give *any competent auditor* the practical power to verify or overturn the result, successful objectivity *rationally licenses, and so justifies, trust*.  Trust is therefore not identical to objectivity; it is the downstream social attitude that the achievement of objectivity warrants.\n\nThe remainder of the essay defends this thesis in five steps:\n\n1. Clarifying the conceptual landscape: kinds of objectivity, kinds of trust.  \n2. Diagnosing the pitfalls of the simple \u201cobjectivity \u21d4 trust\u201d equation.  \n3. Developing the idiosyncrasy-blocking account and showing how it systematically unifies the typology of objectivity.  \n4. Using two extended cases\u201419th-century precision astronomy and contemporary climate modelling\u2014to illustrate the explanatory power of the account.  \n5. Engaging objections and clarifying implications for the politics of expertise.\n\nI.  Disentangling the Key Terms  \n\nA. Varieties of objectivity.  Philosophers and historians have catalogued at least six senses, but three are canonical:\n\n   1. Procedural (or \u201cmechanical\u201d) objectivity: reliance on rule-governed, often instrument-mediated procedures that minimize the role of individual judgment (Daston & Galison, 2007).  \n   2. Convergent (or \u201cresult\u201d) objectivity: independent lines of evidence or methods T1\u2026Tn converge on the same quantitative estimate or qualitative conclusion (Hacking, 1983).  \n   3. Interactive (or \u201ccritical-dialogical\u201d) objectivity: an organised community of diverse inquirers subjects claims to open criticism, replication attempts, and iterative refinement (Longino, 1990).\n\nB. Varieties of trust.  Contemporary analytic work distinguishes at least three layers:\n\n   i. Reliance: mere behavioral dependence (\u201cI rely on my alarm clock\u201d).  \n  ii. Trust: reliance plus a normative expectation of *good will* or adherence to certain standards by the trusted (Hardin, 2002).  \n iii. Trustworthiness: the property of being appropriately trusted\u2014i.e., having the dispositions or structures that justify the attitude of trust.\n\nNote the immediate asymmetry: objectivity is a property (like trustworthiness) whereas trust is an attitude.  Conflating them obscures the direction of dependence: justified trust presupposes (perceived) trustworthiness, which in scientific contexts is typically secured by the attainment of objectivity.\n\nII.  Why the Simple Slogan Misfires  \n\nConsider two scenarios.  (A) A charismatic but secretive inventor announces a revolutionary battery technology, provides glossy graphs, and assures us of objectivity.  (B) The LIGO collaboration reports the first direct detection of gravitational waves, publishing raw data, analysis pipelines, and abundant documentation; its findings are then independently re-analysed by external teams.  In scenario (A) trust may or may not be forthcoming, but no reasonable observer should call the evidence objective.  In scenario (B) objectivity seems well earned, and *because* it is earned, informed trust is rational.\n\nThese scenarios reveal two conceptual errors in the slogan:\n\n1. **Logical reversal:** Trust can be misplaced.  Objectivity is neither necessary (people trust plenty of non-objective outputs) nor sufficient (lay audiences often mistrust objective science for cultural reasons).  \n2. **Category mistake:** Trust is an attitude; objectivity is an achievement.  Saying \u201cobjectivity = trust\u201d conflates a reason for an attitude with the attitude itself.\n\nWhat we want is a theory that grounds the *appropriateness* of trust\u2014i.e., trustworthiness\u2014in features that constitute objectivity.\n\nIII.  Idiosyncrasy-Blocking Public Checkability as the Core  \n\nScientists operate under what we may call the *Idiosyncrasy Constraint*: to be counted as knowledge, a claim must not owe its epistemic authority to idiosyncratic perception, interest, or social position.  The deep worry is the perennial under-determination of theory by individual experience and the relentlessly perspectival character of observation.  All forms of objectivity are engineered responses to that worry.  They do so by institutionalising *three joint strategies*:\n\n1. **Displacement:** Move the epistemic dependence away from private judgments toward publicly accessible markers\u2014mechanical tracings, algorithmic protocols, shared datasets.  \n2. **Redundancy:** Multiply independent routes to the result, so that idiosyncratic error in any single pathway is probabilistically swamped.  \n3. **Contestability:** Ensure procedures and data remain open to scrutiny by diverse others who have the motivation and expertise to reveal hidden idiosyncrasies.\n\nA process or product that satisfies (1)\u2013(3) embodies *idiosyncrasy-blocking public checkability.*  Notice how each canonical sense of objectivity instantiates these strategies:\n\n\u2022 Procedural objectivity foregrounds *displacement* (think of the early use of photographic plates to replace astronomers\u2019 sketching of nebulae).  \n\u2022 Convergent objectivity foregrounds *redundancy* (multiple instruments, datasets, or mathematical derivations).  \n\u2022 Interactive objectivity foregrounds *contestability* (peer review, replication, public data archives).\n\nThe trinity is mutually reinforcing.  Instruments produce publicly storable traces; convergence across instruments invites scrutiny; community scrutiny feeds back into refined procedures.  What unites them is thus not \u201cbeing trusted\u201d but *being structured so that well-placed distrust can, in principle, overturn the result*.  That very feature renders continuing trust rational, because would-be defeaters are systematically empowered to test and undercut the claim.\n\nAnalogy: encryption.  A modern cypher is trustworthy not because users have a warm feeling but because the algorithm is open, the mathematics transparent, and the community of cryptographers free to hammer at it.  Exactly the capacity for *successful* adversarial challenge is what licences further reliance.\n\nIV.  Extended Illustrations  \n\n1. Precision astronomy (circa 1860\u20131900).  \n   Situation: Eclipse expeditions measured solar parallax to determine the astronomical unit.  Early observations relied on naked-eye timing that varied with the observer\u2019s reflexes.  To block that idiosyncrasy, astronomers adopted *transit chronographs*: a star\u2019s passage across wires in the eyepiece triggered an electric signal that stamped the time automatically (procedural objectivity).  They also orchestrated worldwide observations, so that parallax could be computed from independent geographic baselines (convergent objectivity).  Finally, observatories published full data logs enabling rival reductions (interactive objectivity).  The result was a value of the astronomical unit whose credibility no longer hinged on, say, Simon Newcomb\u2019s personal acuity, but on a system whose potential idiosyncrasies were defused.  Because any skilled astronomer could audit the chain, the international community\u2014and eventually the maritime industry\u2014rationally trusted the value.\n\n2. Climate modelling since the 1980s.  \n   Critics worried that general circulation models (GCMs) are \u201ctuned\u201d black boxes.  The modelling community responded by (a) codifying standardised benchmark tests and version control (procedural); (b) building multimodel ensembles\u2014CMIP projects\u2014where structurally distinct models are run with harmonised forcings (convergent); (c) instituting data-sharing mandates, paleoclimate reconstructions, and post-event hind-casts open to all comers (interactive).  The success of this tripartite structure is seen in IPCC assessment reports that include a traceable account of uncertainties.  While lay distrust persists for political reasons, the *epistemic situation* satisfies idiosyncrasy-blocking public checkability: any qualified independent group can download code, re-run scenarios, or develop counter-models.  Consequently, policy makers who defer to these projections do so on a trust rationally grounded in objectivity.\n\nV.  Objections and Replies  \n\nObjection 1: Replication crises in biomedicine and psychology show that \u201cidiosyncrasy-blocking\u201d systematically fails; yet scientists continued to trust the literature for decades.  \n\nReply.  Failure in practice does not refute the account; it highlights that existing procedures fell short of the ideal, precisely because they secretly *did* rely on undetected idiosyncrasies (p-hacking, file-drawer effects).  The crisis vindicates the core: when large-scale replication attempted to re-impose public checkability, trustworthiness and thus rational trust were withdrawn from many claims.\n\nObjection 2: Feminist and post-colonial scholars argue that \u201cpublic\u201d scrutiny often excludes marginalised groups, so idiosyncrasies of dominant standpoints remain invisible.  \n\nReply.  The objection targets the *scope* of the public and the *variety* of idiosyncrasies considered.  It therefore *confirms* rather than undermines the thesis.  What interactive objectivity requires is *pluralistic contestability*\u2014the inclusion of epistemic agents whose different standpoints expose otherwise hidden biases.  Expanding diversity is necessary to approach the ideal of idiosyncrasy-blocking.\n\nObjection 3: Some highly trustworthy results\u2014e.g., common-sense bodily knowledge\u2014are not produced by any specialised idiosyncrasy-blocking mechanism; conversely, high-energy physics has robust mechanisms but garners little lay trust.\n\nReply.  The thesis is restricted to the social institution of scientific knowledge, not to all forms of knowing.  As for physics, the public\u2019s distrust stems from extra-epistemic factors (value conflicts, cognitive distance), showing again that objectivity *licenses* but does not enforce trust.\n\nVI.  Implications and Concluding Synthesis  \n\nWe can now furnish a precise relationship schema:\n\n1. A scientific process P achieves objectivity iff P is designed so that no step essential to the evidential warrant depends on opaque commitments or judgments that escape *in principle* public audit by competent others.  \n2. If an epistemic agent A recognises that P satisfies (1), A possesses defeasible but non-negligible reason to *trust* the outputs of P.  \n3. Different senses of objectivity correspond to different architectural strategies\u2014displacement, redundancy, contestability\u2014realising condition (1) under varying empirical constraints.\n\nCall this the *Epistemic Escrow Model*: objective science places its claims in a figurative escrow that any auditor can open, inspect, and, if warranted, void.  Trust is appropriate precisely because any betrayal is procedurally detectable and sanctionable.  Just as financial escrow makes interpersonal creditworthiness unnecessary, epistemic escrow makes individual virtue dispensable.  What unifies procedural, convergent, and interactive objectivity is that each, in its own idiom, constructs escrow.\n\nThe account improves on the bare slogan in three ways:\n\n\u2022 Conceptual clarity: it distinguishes the psychological attitude (trust) from the structural property (objectivity).  \n\u2022 Unificatory power: it subsumes the typology of objectivity under a single functional criterion\u2014idiosyncrasy-blocking public checkability\u2014thereby explaining why the varieties so often co-occur.  \n\u2022 Normative guidance: it yields diagnostics for current crises (increase redundancy; widen contestability; make data genuinely public) and vindicates calls for epistemic pluralism.\n\nSeen in this light, Fine and Douglas were pointing to an important phenomenological correlate: we reach for the word \u201cobjective\u201d when we experience a sense of warranted security in adopting a claim as a premise in our further reasoning.  But the rationality of that security rests, not in the attitude itself, but in the escrow architecture of scientific practice.  The more transparent, redundant, and contestable that architecture, the more richly deserved is our trust.", "output_tokens": 3335, "reasoning_tokens": 576}

Introduction and Thesis  \nCalls for \u201cobjectivity\u201d in science are never merely semantic. Funding decisions, public policy, and everyday credibility hinge on that single word. Arthur Fine and Heather Douglas capture an important phenomenological fact when they say that to label some result objective is, in effect, to say it can be trusted. But taken literally, the slogan \u201cobjectivity = trust\u201d collapses two different explanatory layers. Trust is a second-order attitude that epistemic agents adopt toward claims; objectivity is a first-order property of investigative outputs that is supposed to warrant such an attitude. My thesis is therefore three-part:\n\n1. Scientific objectivity is best understood as modal robustness: the truth-value (or approximate truth-value) of a claim is insensitive to a wide range of admissible perturbations in the processes that generate or scrutinize it.   \n2. Procedural, convergent, and interactive objectivity are three complementary strategies for engineering this robustness\u2014algorithmic, plural-path, and adversarial, respectively.  \n3. Because robustness grounds rational confidence, objectivity is the primary explanans and warranted trust the explanandum. Fine and Douglas are right about the practical upshot, but trust is a symptom, not the common essence.  \n\nIf successful, the account both clarifies why talk of \u201cobjective yet untrusted\u201d sounds oxymoronic\u2014lack of trust signals suspected fragility\u2014and provides a unifying architecture that treats the apparently disparate senses of objectivity as coordinated robustness-building devices.\n\n2. Where the Trust-First Picture Falters  \nFine\u2019s Natural Ontological Attitude (NOA) and Douglas\u2019s ethics-of-science framework emphasize that the label \u201cobjective\u201d is honorific in deliberation; it functions to recommend reliance. Yet two difficulties arise if we analyze objectivity directly as \u201cwhat can be trusted\u201d:\n\nA. Regress of reference. If I ask, \u201cWhy trust this output?\u201d, the answer \u201cBecause it is objective, i.e. trustworthy,\u201d is circular. We need criteria that explain *why* trust is earned.  \nB. Misaligned extension. We sometimes must trust where objectivity is unattainable (e.g., emergency medical testimony) and occasionally withhold trust even when objectivity seems high (e.g., a correct but undisclosed secret algorithm). The two notions diverge extensionally in these edge cases.\n\nHence a more precise analysis must locate objectivity in features of knowledge-producing and knowledge-vetting practices whose presence would *justify* trust rather than merely correlate with it.\n\n3. Robustness as the Core of Objectivity  \nThe intuition behind every sense of objectivity is resistance to epistemically irrelevant contingencies. Translate that into modal language and we obtain:\n\nRobustness Thesis  \nA claim C is objective to the extent that, across a space of counterfactual scenarios where epistemically *irrelevant* factors vary and epistemically *relevant* factors are held fixed, the truth-value of C remains stable.\n\nWhat counts as relevant or irrelevant is domain-specific, but paradigmatically irrelevant factors include the individual identity, background values, or psychological quirks of investigators; relevant factors include instrumentation accuracy and statistical sampling.\n\nRobustness is a property of the *relationship* between world, method, and claim. It is thus finer-grained than \u201ctruth\u201d yet broader than any single method. The more dimensions along which stability obtains, the more objective the claim.\n\n4. Decomposing the Three Senses\n\n4.1 Procedural Objectivity  \nCanonical form: standardized protocol + mechanical rules \u2192 invariant outcome.  \nExample: Blood-alcohol measurements governed by ISO procedures.  \n\nHere robustness is sought by *algorithmic invariance*: if every competent technician following the same steps gets the same readout, then perturbing the *person* variable yields no downstream change. This immunizes the result against idiosyncratic skill or bias.\n\n4.2 Convergent Objectivity  \nCanonical form: temporally and methodologically independent inquiries converge on the same conclusion.  \nExample: The fine-structure constant measured via anomalous magnetic moments, atomic interferometry, and astrophysical spectra.  \n\nRobustness here is *plural-path invariance*: alter the causal route of evidence acquisition while holding the target phenomenon fixed, and the claim\u2019s truth-value is preserved. Convergence reduces the probability that a shared error schema explains agreement.\n\n4.3 Interactive (or Social) Objectivity  \nCanonical form: claims survive open, vigorous criticism from differently situated investigators.  \nExample: LIGO\u2019s discovery paper passed through blind injections, adversarial data challenges, and replication by Virgo before community endorsement.  \n\nRobustness is achieved via *adversarial invariance*: subject the claim to iterated perturbations in interpretive framing, theoretical allegiance, or social standpoint, and it withstands motivated scrutiny. The critical community acts as an error-amplifier: if a conclusion turns on a fragile assumption, somebody with incentive to reject it will locate the flaw.\n\nEach sense therefore occupies a different axis in robustness space\u2014procedural (agent-invariance), convergent (path-invariance), interactive (standpoint-invariance)\u2014but all instantiate the same modal logic.\n\n5. Trust as Rational Reaction  \nWhy, on this model, does objectivity merit trust? Because robustness is epistemic risk mitigation. If a claim\u2019s truth stabilizes under perturbations we have independent reason to think might obtain, then the conditional probability of its being false given the total evidence drops. Trust, in the epistemic sense, is the disposition to rely on a claim in further deliberation or action. Rational agents calibrate that disposition to perceived risk; robustness lowers risk; hence objectivity earns trust.\n\nFormally: Let R range over robustness-conferring properties and T(x) be \u201cit is rational to trust x.\u201d Then  \n\u2200x (Robust(x) \u2192 LowRisk(x))  \n\u2200x (LowRisk(x) \u2192 T(x))  \nSo \u2200x (Robust(x) \u2192 T(x)).  \nTrust is downstream of robustness, not constitutive of it.\n\n6. Dialectical Objections and Replies  \n\nObjection 1: Anti-realists might say that robustness merely reflects social consensus; it cannot secure truth.  \nReply: Robustness is not metaphysically loaded. It is a probabilistic surrogate for truth-approximating reliability, compatible with anti-realist metaphysics. What matters is stability across perturbations *we have antecedent reason* to suspect; this underwrites predictive and manipulative success regardless of realism.\n\nObjection 2: Feminist standpoint theorists (Longino, Harding) argue that what counts as \u201cirrelevant\u201d contingencies is itself value-laden.  \nReply: Granted. The robustness framework is parametric: the invariance base is defined through deliberative negotiation. Interactive objectivity explicitly builds such negotiation into the process, letting marginalized standpoints expand the set of scrutinized perturbations. Thus the account incorporates, rather than evades, the feminist insight.\n\nObjection 3: Hardwig and others emphasize epistemic dependence: laypersons must trust experts directly, without ability to assay robustness themselves. Doesn\u2019t that reinstate trust as primitive?  \nReply: At the retail level, yes, but institutionally our trust is mediated by expert testimony about robustness indications (peer review, replication statistics, meta-analysis). The dependence is testimonial; the warranting property remains robustness, just as my trusting a bridge does not render \u201cload-tested structural integrity\u201d dispensable.\n\nObjection 4: Deep-learning systems can generate correct predictions via opaque pathways, defeating procedural and interactive transparency. Are their outputs objective?  \nReply: The robustness criterion handles this: deploy adversarial attacks, training-data perturbations, and cross-architecture replication. If the outputs are stable under these probes, they count as objective; if they fail (as many current models do), warranted trust is withheld regardless of headline accuracy.\n\n7. Precision in Related Concepts  \nReliability vs. Robustness: Reliability is long-run frequency of truth; robustness is multi-path invariance *conditional on actual or hypothetical perturbations*. Reliability can be high by luck; robustness requires modal counterfactual support.  \nCredibility vs. Trust: Credibility is third-person assessment of plausibility; trust is action-guiding reliance. Robustness grounds both but suffices for the latter only when the agent\u2019s stakes and alternatives align.  \nTransparency: often aids interactive objectivity but is not necessary (e.g., double-blind trials achieve robustness by eliminating translator bias, not by revealing hidden variables).\n\n8. Case Study: Climate Attribution Science  \nClimate scientists claim that recent warming is \u201cextremely likely\u201d anthropogenic. Procedural objectivity: standardized thermometric calibrations and satellites minimize observer effects. Convergent objectivity: paleoclimate proxies, ocean heat content, and reanalysis models all converge on similar warming trends. Interactive objectivity: skeptical researchers (some funded by fossil-fuel think tanks) continually probe for model deficiencies; successive IPCC iterations incorporate these critiques. Because the core attribution claim survives perturbations in measurement protocol, evidential pathway, and interpretive standpoint, it scores high on robustness. Therefore rational public trust is warranted, a diagnosis consistent with but not reducible to the mere fact that many scientists say so.\n\n9. Advantages Over the Trust-First Account  \nA. Normative clarity: Distinguishing objectivity from trust allows critique of misplaced trust (e.g., early COVID-19 mask guidance) without semantic contortions.  \nB. Explanatory depth: The robustness model predicts why the three senses of objectivity cluster in scientific rhetoric; they are interchangeable *because* they target orthogonal dimensions of the same modal property.  \nC. Action-guidance: Policymakers can invest in robustness-enhancing infrastructures\u2014open data, replication funding, adversarial review\u2014knowing these are not just PR but epistemically salient.\n\n10. Potential Generativity  \nThe robustness framework suggests a research program: formalize the \u201cperturbation space\u201d for different disciplines, perhaps borrowing techniques from sensitivity analysis and causal modeling. One could even approximate an \u201cobjectivity index\u201d by weighting stability across axes, allowing decision-makers to compare evidential bases quantitatively. Whether this metric is feasible is an open empirical question, but the theoretical architecture renders the proposal intelligible.\n\n11. Conclusion  \nFine and Douglas are correct that objectivity and trust are entwined in science\u2019s self-conception, but the knot need not be a conceptual tangle. Objectivity is best parsed as modal robustness; trust is the rational attitude licensed by perceived robustness. Procedural, convergent, and interactive objectivity are not competing definitions but engineering principles for constructing, detecting, and amplifying robustness across different epistemically irrelevant dimensions.

Orientation and Thesis  \n\nPhilosophers now speak freely of multiple \u201cobjectivities\u201d: on one list we find procedural objectivity (strict adherence to standardized methods), convergent objectivity (robustness across different investigative routes), interactive objectivity (results stabilized through critical dialogue), and more.  Arthur Fine and Heather Douglas have suggested that the thread running through all these notions is trust: when we pronounce a result \u201cobjective,\u201d we are saying, in effect, \u201cyou may trust it.\u201d  That slogan has intuitive appeal but leaves two questions unanswered.  \n\nQ1 \u2014 What sort of trust is at issue? (Personal? Social? Epistemic? Instrumental?)  \n\nQ2 \u2014 Is trust constitutive of objectivity, or merely its downstream effect?\n\nMy thesis is two-part:  \n\n1. The common core of the various senses of scientific objectivity is not trust itself but the presence of what I will call an Epistemic Accountability Infrastructure (EAI): a set of impersonal mechanisms\u2014methodological, material, and social\u2014that (i) neutralize the idiosyncratic factors of particular investigators, (ii) make the grounds of claims publicly inspectable, and (iii) keep those claims perpetually answerable to potential criticism.  \n\n2. Talk of \u201cobjectivity\u201d is shorthand for the judgment that such an infrastructure is functioning adequately in a given context; that judgment warrants a distinctive attitude of epistemic trust in those who did not themselves participate. Trust is therefore a rational response to objectivity, not its constitutive element.\n\nBy relocating trust downstream from infrastructure, we can explain both why objectivity licenses trust and why failures in any of the three EAI dimensions immediately invite charges of \u201cbias,\u201d \u201csubjectivity,\u201d or \u201cbad science.\u201d  Furthermore, the three canonical forms of objectivity map onto the three infrastructure dimensions in a systematic way, thereby providing the sought-after unification.\n\n2. Clarifying \u201cTrust\u201d  \n\n\u201cTrust\u201d is a family resemblance term.  For present purposes we need three contrasts:\n\na. Personal vs. impersonal trust.  Personal trust is the attitude I bear toward my friend; impersonal trust is the standing I grant to, say, the Paris Metro timetable or the NOAA weather forecast.  Scientific objectivity is concerned with the latter.\n\nb. Rational reliance vs. affective vulnerability.  I may rely on a calculator without opening myself up emotionally; the calculator cannot betray me.  The trust relevant to science is the rational-reliance variety.\n\nc. Attitude vs. property.  To say I trust x is to report my attitude; to say x is trustworthy attributes a property to x.  Objectivity concerns the property side: it is a claim that the epistemic product is trustworthy.\n\nThese distinctions dissolve a common equivocation.  Fine\u2019s slogan \u201cobjectivity just means you can trust it\u201d might be heard as defining objectivity in terms of an attitude.  But the actors whose trust matters most\u2014future researchers, policymakers, lay citizens\u2014typically form their attitudes on the basis of publicly available indicators of trustworthiness.  A more precise account should therefore focus on those indicators.\n\n3. The Epistemic Accountability Infrastructure (EAI)\n\nThe EAI idea draws on long-standing themes\u2014Mertonian norms, Longino\u2019s \u201ccritical interactions,\u201d Shapin\u2019s \u201cvirtual witnessing\u201d\u2014but crystallizes them into three jointly necessary, mutually reinforcing conditions.\n\nE1. Anti-Idiosyncrasy Mechanisms.  \nThese are procedures or material setups designed to nullify the influence of any single investigator\u2019s cognitive, perceptual, or value-laden quirks.  Double-blind trials, calibration protocols, randomized sampling, and automated data logging all belong here.\n\nE2. Public Access to Grounds.  \nData, methods, and inferential steps must be recorded in a form that competent outsiders could in principle scrutinize.  This is not mere reproducibility; it is transparency regarding how the conclusion was reached.  The rise of open notebooks and data repositories marks increasing recognition of E2.\n\nE3. Responsiveness to Criticism.  \nScientific communities must provide organized opportunities for challenge and correction\u2014peer review, replication studies, adversarial collaborations, error-report archives.  What matters is a standing invitation to potential falsification coupled with incentives to heed it.\n\nWhen these three dimensions are in place, the output of inquiry is insulated from both individual bias and collective drift.  That insulation, I claim, is what we properly call \u201cobjectivity.\u201d  Trust\u2014impersonal, rational reliance\u2014becomes a justified attitude for non-participants because the EAI gives them warranted confidence that, had they done the work themselves with equal competence, they would (very probably) have reached the same result.\n\n4. Mapping the Canonical Objectivities onto EAI  \n\n4.1 Procedural Objectivity  \u2192  Anti-Idiosyncrasy (E1)  \nProcedural objectivity valorizes standardized measurement techniques, explicit coding manuals, and algorithmic data processing.  Its paradigm cases\u201418th-century geodesists synchronizing chronometers, the 20th-century Brix scale for sugar content\u2014exemplify the drive to suppress the peculiar sensory judgments of individual observers.  That is precisely what Anti-Idiosyncrasy mechanisms do.\n\n4.2 Convergent Objectivity  \u2192  Public Access and Redundancy (E2 + E1)  \nA result is \u201cconvergent\u201d when independent methods, each with distinct error structures, nevertheless yield the same parameter values.  Think of the multiple pathways to Avogadro\u2019s number or the triangulation on the neutrino mass.  Convergence presupposes that the evidence trail of each method is publicly accessible so that comparative assessment is possible.  Thus E2 is indispensable, while E1 ensures that convergence is not an artifact of shared biases.\n\n4.3 Interactive Objectivity  \u2192  Responsiveness (E3)  \nHelen Longino emphasizes the critical dialogue through which hypotheses are subjected to diverse perspectives.  Interactive objectivity lives or dies by institutionalized criticism: seminars, replication attempts, rival labs.  That is E3 in action.\n\nThe mapping is not one-to-one\u2014the dimensions interlock\u2014but it is tight enough to justify treating EAI as the deeper unifier.\n\n5. Examples that Do Real Work\n\nExample 1: The 1986 Challenger Disaster Investigation  \nThe Rogers Commission obtained o-ring data from multiple sources, made them publicly available, and conducted adversarial questioning of Morton-Thiokol engineers.  Anti-Idiosyncrasy (data logging), Public Access (open hearings), Responsiveness (cross-examination) were all present, enabling non-experts to rationally trust the judgment that cold-temperature brittleness caused the failure.  Contrast NASA\u2019s earlier internal decision, reached in closed meetings, which lacked E2 and E3 and was later branded \u201csubjective\u201d and \u201cbiased.\u201d\n\nExample 2: CRISPR Gene-Editing Off-Target Effects  \nEarly claims of safety were based on in-house sequencing with idiosyncratic bioinformatic pipelines.  Critics demanded raw data and reanalysis (E2) and performed independent CRISPR screens with different algorithms (E1).  The ensuing dialectic (E3) led to the concession that off-target risks were higher than first advertised.  Here the slide from \u201cobjective\u201d to \u201cpremature\u201d tracked failures in the infrastructure.\n\nThese cases show that it is the presence or absence of EAI components, not mere testimonial reputation, that governs our judgments of objectivity and thereby our willingness to trust.\n\n6. Addressing Objections\n\nObjection A: Trust Is Partly Constitutive; Without a Baseline of Social Trust, No Infrastructure Gets Off the Ground.\n\nReply: True at the sociological level, but my thesis concerns the epistemic property.  Money also presupposes social trust, yet the mark of genuine currency lies in security features, not in the purchaser\u2019s attitude.  Analogously, the objectivity of a claim depends on infrastructural features that warrant trust, even though those features themselves would be useless absent some minimal background trust in the game of science.\n\nObjection B: Value-Ladenness Shows that Anti-Idiosyncrasy Is Impossible; Thus Objectivity Cannot Be Infrastructure-Based.\n\nReply: Eliminating every value influence is indeed impossible, but EAI aims not at purity but at accountable integration.  Anti-Idiosyncrasy blunts the parochial aspects of individual values, while Responsiveness allows community values to be contested.  Douglas herself distinguishes between \u201cillicit\u201d and \u201cproper\u201d roles for values; EAI provides the boundary conditions for propriety.\n\nObjection C: Certain Disciplines (e.g., Paleontology) Cannot Satisfy E1 Because Experiments Are Irreproducible; Yet We Still Call Their Results Objective.\n\nReply: My account allows domain-relative realizations of E1.  In historical sciences, Anti-Idiosyncrasy is achieved by triangulating multiple kinds of trace evidence (isotopic ratios, cladistic patterns, sedimentology) rather than by manipulating variables experimentally.  The key is still to neutralize individual idiosyncrasy through methodical redundancy.\n\n7. Precision of Distinctions\n\nThe EAI framework rests on a distinction between reliability and objectivity often blurred in the literature.  A thermometer can be reliable yet its reading non-objective if the only evidence is a researcher\u2019s notebook that no one else may inspect.  Conversely, a preliminary satellite data set can be objective\u2014its acquisition fully transparent and criticism-ready\u2014while still unreliable in the sense of having large error bars.  Objectivity thus concerns the warrant structure, not the truth probability.  The clarity of this distinction explains otherwise puzzling judgments: scientists sometimes regard unreliable yet objective data as more valuable than reliable yet opaque data, because the former at least remain open to community improvement.\n\n8. Substantive Contribution: From EAI to a Quantitative Research Program\n\nIf objectivity is an infrastructure property, we should be able to measure it.  Recent work on \u201copen science indicators\u201d (data-sharing rates, pre-registration compliance) and on \u201cerror-corrective efficiency\u201d (speed of retraction after anomaly detection) could be unified under an EAI metric.  Such a metric would enable funding agencies to allocate resources not just on citation counts but on the quality of epistemic accountability.  That is a new research program suggested by the present analysis.\n\n9. Reframing the Debate\n\nThe classic \u201cmethods vs. community\u201d debate about objectivity now appears mis-cast.  Methods (E1) and community practices (E3) are not rival foundations; they are complementary axes of a single three-dimensional space.  Likewise, worries that \u201cobjectivity\u201d is an obsolete Enlightenment relic dissolve once we notice that the term earns its keep as a compact signal for a complex but intelligible infrastructure.  We neither mystify objectivity as correspondence with God\u2019s eye nor deflate it to mere consensus; we locate it in continually maintained practices that diminish epistemic risk for third parties.\n\n10. Conclusion\n\nFine and Douglas were right that objectivity and trust are intertwined, but the relation is not identity.  Objectivity is best conceived as the property of being generated and sustained by an Epistemic Accountability Infrastructure comprising Anti-Idiosyncrasy mechanisms, Public Access to grounds, and Responsiveness to criticism.  When we judge a scientific claim objective, we are asserting that this infrastructure is in place; therefore, we\u2014and others\u2014may trust the claim without deference to individual authority.  The three familiar kinds of objectivity\u2014procedural, convergent, and interactive\u2014slot neatly into the three EAI dimensions, thereby unifying them under a sharper analytical lens.  If the account is sound, future discussions should pivot from vague talk of \u201ctrust\u201d to concrete assessments of infrastructural adequacy\u2014a shift that promises not only philosophical clarity but also practical guidance for improving scientific practice itself.", "output_tokens": 2938, "reasoning_tokens": 384}

The Puzzle  \n\nWe often say things like \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t believe that conspiracy theory; there\u2019s no evidence for it\u201d (an epistemic rebuke) and \u201cYou ought not to believe the doctor\u2019s rosy prognosis\u2014if she\u2019s wrong you\u2019ll skip palliative care and suffer needlessly\u201d (a practical rebuke).  We talk as though both epistemic and practical considerations are genuine reasons for or against belief.  Yet the two kinds of reasons appear to be of different kinds entirely.  Epistemic reasons track a constitutive aim of belief\u2014accuracy, truth-conduciveness\u2014while practical reasons track the downstream value or harm of having (or lacking) the belief.  How could such reasons interact in a single deliberation?  They look incommensurable in the way the taste of music and the colour of numbers seem incommensurable: they answer to different standards.  And still the ordinary \u201cought\u201d of belief seems to invite them both to the deliberative table.  \n\nMy thesis is that the apparent incommensurability is an artifact of thinking of belief-regulation as a one-shot affair governed by a single master standard.  Once we recognise that doxastic deliberation naturally proceeds in two stages\u2014first, a truth-directed stage that delivers a credal state, and second, a pragmatic gate-keeping stage that decides which coarse-grained attitude (believe, disbelieve, suspend) to adopt for the moment\u2014we can give a principled account of how the two families of reasons combine.  Epistemic considerations dominate the first stage; practical considerations enter only in the second, by fixing a context-sensitive threshold on how much epistemic justification is needed for full belief (or rejection).  The result is not a numerical \u201cweighing\u201d of the incomparable, but an interaction rule: practical stakes modulate the evidential bar.  The view both preserves the constitutive link between belief and truth and explains why, in high-stakes environments, perfectly decent evidence can nonetheless fail to authorise belief.\n\n2. Preliminaries: Three Distinctions that Clarify the Terrain  \n\n(1) Belief vs. Credence.  I take \u201cbelief\u201d to be a coarse-grained, yes-or-no attitude that guides categorical action; \u201ccredence\u201d is a fine-grained degree of confidence, representable by a probability function.  You can have credence .73 in p without believing p.  \n\n(2) Epistemic vs. Practical Rationality.  Epistemic rationality is minimal expected inaccuracy of representation; practical rationality is maximal expected utility of outcomes, where those outcomes can include moral, prudential, or aesthetic goods.  \n\n(3) Permission vs. Requirement.  Epistemic standards often yield \u201cpermission\u201d (it is permissible to believe p given evidence E) rather than requirement; practical stakes frequently determine whether permission is enough or a stronger epistemic showing is needed.\n\nKeeping the distinctions explicit prevents three common conflations: (i) that practical encroachment is about truth-insensitive weights; (ii) that belief-formation and belief-maintenance have identical norms; and (iii) that any influence of the practical is an illicit \u201cwishful thinking.\u201d\n\n3. Why Simple Aggregation Fails  \n\nSuppose we try to aggregate the two kinds of reasons into a single scale\u2014say, numerically.  Let T be the epistemic score of a belief candidate, U its practical score.  If we could assign cardinal numbers to each and add them (\u03b1T + \u03b2U), we would have an all-things-considered norm.  Two problems arise.  \n\n(a) Common Currency.  The disvalue of error (being false) is not obviously of the same kind as the disvalue of missing a train or harming a friend.  Converting both to utility points amounts to presupposing the very commensurability we need to earn.  \n\n(b) Constitutive Priority.  Belief aims at truth in a way choosing lunch does not.  Any norm that allows large pragmatic rewards to swamp massive evidential deficits threatens to cancel the very practice of believing as opposed to fantasising.  \n\nThus a one-level \u201cweighing\u201d model either makes the two kinds of reasons commensurable by fiat or undermines the nature of belief.  We need a different architecture.\n\n4. The Two-Stage Model  \n\n4.1 Stage 1: Fixing Credences by Purely Epistemic Norms  \n\nAgents start with evidence E.  Bayesian epistemology tells us how to adopt a credence function P(\u00b7|E) that minimises expected inaccuracy given E.  Nothing practical enters yet; we are simply representing the world as best we can.  The deliverance is a distribution of credences, not full beliefs.\n\nWhy is this stage insulated from the practical?  Because any earlier intrusion would break what Paul Grice called the \u201ctransparency\u201d of epistemic deliberation: to answer \u201cShould I believe p?\u201d one normally asks \u201cIs p true?\u201d not \u201cWould believing p be good for me?\u201d  Transparency is not optional; it is part of what makes the state belief rather than intention or hope.\n\n4.2 Stage 2: From Credence to Categorical Attitude via a Stake-Sensitive Threshold  \n\nOur second task is to decide which coarse-grained attitude to adopt: believe, suspend, disbelieve.  For most practical purposes we cannot carry an actuarial table of credences into action; we need something categorical.  Here practical stakes make an appearance, not by weighing against evidence but by fixing the confidence threshold at which categorical belief is rationally permitted or required.\n\nDefine an acceptance threshold \u03c4 that is a function of:\n\n(i) Loss of acting on a false positive (LFP).\n(ii) Loss of acting on a false negative (LFN).\n(iii) Background symmetry conditions (e.g., the benefit of acting on a true positive).\n\nA familiar decision-theoretic derivation (Levi, Buchak, and others) tells us that the threshold for accepting p is:  \n\n\u03c4 = LFN / (LFN + LFP).  \n\nIf falsely accepting p is disastrous (LFP \u2192 \u221e), \u03c4 approaches 1; you need near-certainty.  If falsely rejecting p is disastrous but false acceptance trivial, \u03c4 drops toward 0; little evidence suffices.\n\nCrucially, \u03c4 does not weigh epistemic and practical reasons against each other.  Epistemic reasons deliver P(p|E); practical reasons modulate the categorical mapping f(P) = {accept, suspend, reject}.  They interact by threshold modulation, not by summation.\n\n5. Illustrative Cases  \n\nCase A: The Classroom Election.  \nA teacher is 70% sure Alice cheated on an exam.  If she falsely believes that and accuses Alice, Alice\u2019s reputation is ruined (high LFP).  If she falsely suspends judgement, the cheater might go unpunished (moderate LFN).  Here \u03c4 might be .95.  P = .7 < \u03c4, so the teacher should withhold belief.  Epistemically, .7 is strong support; practically, not enough.\n\nCase B: The Nuclear Engineer.  \nAn engineer has only 55% confidence a pressure gauge is malfunctioning.  If she falsely disbelieves malfunction, a meltdown occurs (astronomical LFN).  If she falsely believes malfunction, they shut down the reactor unnecessarily (minor LFP relative to meltdown).  Here \u03c4 is low, say .1, so P > \u03c4 and belief is mandated despite weak evidence.\n\nThe examples show interaction without commensurability.  Evidence determines P; stakes fix \u03c4; the comparison P \u2265 \u03c4 yields the \u201cought.\u201d\n\n6. Advantages over Rivals  \n\n6.1 Over Pure Evidentialism  \n\nPure evidentialism (only epistemic reasons bear on belief) must treat the engineer\u2019s belief as irrational wishful thinking.  But ordinary practice and risk management manuals approve her doxastic stance.  The two-stage model explains the approval without denying the constitutive aim of belief; the engineer\u2019s credence is set by evidence alone, but practical reason justifies acting and believing decisively at that credence.\n\n6.2 Over Pragmatic Encroachment Monism  \n\nPragmatic encroachers like Fantl and McGrath collapse the two stages: the truth of \u201cS knows that p\u201d or \u201cS is justified in believing p\u201d depends directly on stakes.  Critics worry this violates transparency: I can\u2019t rationally boost my confidence just because a lot rides on p.  The two-stage account keeps justification (Stage 1) stake-independent and lets stakes matter only to policy (Stage 2).  Transparency is preserved.\n\n6.3 Over Dual-Ought Pluralism  \n\nAnother rival view says there are simply two oughts: an epistemic ought and an all-things-considered ought, and sometimes they conflict, full stop.  This mutes the puzzle but yields an unpalatable result: a single mental act is simultaneously rational and irrational.  The two-stage model dissolves the contradiction.  The subject is epistemically rational in credal formation and practically rational in categorical adoption; there is no joint evaluation that attributes both rationality and irrationality to the same state.\n\n7. Objections and Replies  \n\nObjection 1: The model licenses belief with less than maximal accuracy; isn\u2019t that a violation of the constitutive aim of belief?  \n\nReply: The constitutive aim governs Stage 1.  Stage 2 is not about aiming; it is about commitment under bounded time and cognitive resources.  Just as one may adopt a simplifying idealisation in science without forsaking truth as the ultimate aim, one may adopt a categorical belief at credence .55 when stakes require decisive action.  Truth remains the norm that regulates representation; practical considerations regulate commitment.\n\nObjection 2: Thresholds appear arbitrary or agent-relative.  But rationality is supposed to be objective.  \n\nReply: They are agent-relative in the same way prudential permissions are: what you ought to eat depends on your allergies.  Objectivity is preserved at a higher level: given a specific LFP and LFN, the threshold is uniquely determined by decision-theoretic dominance principles.  Two agents with identical stakes will converge.\n\nObjection 3: What about moral encroachment, cases where the stakes are borne by others (e.g., racial profiling)?  Does the model trivialise the moral wrongness of certain beliefs?  \n\nReply: No.  Moral costs feed into LFP and LFN just like prudential costs.  If falsely believing that a job candidate is lazy on flimsy stereotype grounds imposes a grave moral cost on her, \u03c4 rises dramatically, and coincidence with our moral intuition is explained.  The model unifies pragmatic and moral encroachment without making morality a sui generis epistemic norm.\n\nObjection 4: The model seems silent on long-run epistemic flourishing (scientific inquiry) where short-run stakes are low.  \n\nReply: When LFP and LFN are both low, \u03c4 approximates .5.  In such contexts our practice of scientific suspension until overwhelming evidence arrives is explained not by practical stakes but by the institutional design of science: journals, tenure committees, and funding create artificial LFP in the form of reputational cost for error, thereby raising \u03c4.  The model can accommodate long-run epistemic virtues by noting that social structures manipulate stakes to secure accuracy.\n\n8. Metanormative Payoff: A Template for Cross-Domain Reason Aggregation  \n\nThe two-stage architecture generalises.  Whenever a mental state has a constitutive aim (accuracy for belief, lawful coordination for intention, aesthetic unity for appreciation) but also carries practical upshot, we should expect:\n\nStage 1: Constitutive-aim rationality.  \nStage 2: Pragmatic gate-keeping via stake-sensitive thresholds.\n\nThus, rather than postulating mysterious commensurability across normative domains, we give them orthogonal jobs in a serial pipeline.  Interaction is real but mediated by a rule\u2014threshold modulation\u2014rather than by cardinal trade-offs.\n\n9. Substantive Contribution: Threshold Modulation as a Norm of Epistemic Risk Management  \n\nThe philosophical novelty here is the articulation of stake-sensitive threshold modulation as the mechanism by which practical reasons operate on belief without collapsing into evidentialism or pragmatic encroachment monism.  This proposal earns its keep by:\n\n(i) Explaining a wide swath of intuitive verdicts across prudential, moral, and purely epistemic cases.  \n(ii) Preserving transparency in evidential deliberation.  \n(iii) Avoiding dual-ought schizophrenia.  \n(iv) Offering a decision-theoretic derivation that can be operationalised (important for applied epistemology and AI safety).\n\n10. Conclusion  \n\nThe spectre of incommensurability between epistemic and practical reasons dissolves once we abandon the picture of belief regulation as \u201call at once\u201d balancing on a single fulcrum.  Belief formation is better conceived as a two-stage process: first, form credences solely with an eye to truth; second, given the pragmatic landscape, decide whether the credence suffices for categorical commitment.  Practical reasons therefore do not compete with epistemic reasons on the same field; rather, they fix the standards under which epistemic reasons authorise belief.  The interaction is principled, transparent, and respects the constitutive aim of belief, thereby vindicating our everyday and scientific practices of regulating belief under risk.", "output_tokens": 3596, "reasoning_tokens": 704}

Epistemic reasons appear to be about truth-conduciveness\u2014\u200bthey tell us which doxastic states would accurately represent the world.  Practical reasons are about what is good or valuable\u2014\u200bthey tell us which doxastic states would make things go better for ourselves or for others.  How can one even begin to weigh the accuracy of a belief against, say, the avoidable deaths it might cause?  Are we condemned to choose arbitrarily, to treat one domain as normatively irrelevant, or to admit that there are two incompatible \u201coughts\u201d that never meet?\n\nI shall argue that the appearance of incommensurability arises because we picture the reasons as competing at the same deliberative moment, when in fact they operate at different stages of a two-step normative architecture.  Roughly:\n\nStep 1  (Epistemic Stage):  Agents are governed by a purely epistemic directive to place their credences in the accuracy-maximising distribution given the information available (or to suspend if the distribution is underdetermined).\n\nStep 2  (Practical Stage):  Given that credence distribution, agents must decide what doxastic policies, speech acts, and practical initiatives to undertake\u2014\u200bincluding whether to (a) bet, (b) assert, (c) seek more evidence, (d) publicly avow, or (e) treat the proposition as a premise in planning.  At this stage, practical reasons set context-sensitive thresholds for transitioning from mere credence to full belief, for publicly acting on a proposition, or for settling inquiry.\n\nBecause the two sets of reasons govern distinct decision points, they need not be weighed on a single scale.  Epistemic reasons determine which credence function is rationally permissible; practical reasons determine what it is permissible to *do* with that credence\u2014\u200band sometimes \u201cdoing\u201d includes voluntary acts that intensify, stabilise, or publicise one\u2019s doxastic state.  The seeming incommensurability dissolves once we cease to look for a single all-things-considered *belief*-rule and instead recognise a priority-plus-threshold structure: accuracy comes first, but very high stakes can raise the threshold at which credence justifies committed belief or closure of inquiry.\n\nI.  The Puzzle in Sharp Relief\n--------------------------------\nConsider three classic cases.\n\nA.  Clifford\u2019s Shipowner:  A negligent shipowner convinces himself, on flimsy evidence, that his vessel is seaworthy; passengers die.  Our moral condemnation seems to target his *belief* as much as his subsequent neglect.\n\nB.  Medical Optimism:  A patient with a grave illness tends to recover when she firmly believes she will survive.  Her evidence gives survival a 30% chance, yet believing it would significantly raise that probability.  Her doctor wonders whether to encourage belief beyond the evidence.\n\nC.  High-Stakes Bank:  You recall that your paycheck was deposited on Friday.  Ordinarily that suffices for believing there is money in the bank, but if a miscalculation would make your child miss a life-saving surgery, you hesitate.  Suddenly you demand more certainty.\n\nIn each case we are pulled in two directions.  Clifford intuits that epistemic negligence is morally blameworthy; James\u2019s surgery case suggests that practical stakes legitimately affect whether it is OK to believe; yet evidentialists insist that only accuracy matters to belief per se.  If both considerations are genuine, how do they interact?\n\nII.  Existing Accounts and Their Limitations\n-------------------------------------------\n1.  Pure Evidentialism (Clifford, Feldman):  Only epistemic reasons bear on belief; practical reasons tell us what to *do* given our belief, not whether to hold it.  Problem: cannot explain morally loaded criticism of beliefs themselves (the shipowner) nor rational hesitation in high-stakes knowledge cases.\n\n2.  Pragmatic Encroachment (Fantl & McGrath; Stanley):  Practical stakes partly determine the epistemic standards for knowledge or justified belief.  Problem: collapses practical reasons into the epistemic domain, obscuring why the contribution of stakes feels *different in kind* and inviting charges of relativism about truth-aimed norms.\n\n3.  Dual Oughts (Hieronymi; Owens):  There is an epistemic \u201cought\u201d and an all-things-considered practical \u201cought\u201d; conflict is possible and non-resolvable.  Problem: leaves the agent without guidance when the oughts diverge, and cannot explain why sometimes stakes *do* seem to affect what one flatly ought to believe (Medical Optimism).\n\n4.  Reductionism (Pascalian, Utility-theoretic):  Assign each type of reason a common currency (expected value of world-states) and maximise.  Problem: distorts the epistemic goal\u2014\u200btruth is not just another payoff among many; moreover, the reduction implies it can be rational to believe what one knows is false if the utility is high enough, which violates the transparency of belief.\n\nIII.  A Two-Step Normative Architecture\n---------------------------------------\nMy proposal preserves the intuition that accuracy is non-negotiable while granting practical considerations genuine normative force.  The key is to treat belief-formation and belief-deployment as governed by *different* directives.\n\nStep 1: Evidence-Constrained Credence  \nAt any time t, the agent\u2019s credence function Cr_t should approximate the evidentially best (accuracy-expectation-maximising) distribution compatible with her information set I_t.  The directive is categorical and purely epistemic: form credences so as to minimise expected inaccuracy (as measured, say, by a strictly proper scoring rule).  Practical reasons do not enter; they neither raise nor lower the standards for correctness here.  The medical patient does not get to assign survival probability .9 just because it would help her recover; that would violate Step 1.\n\nStep 2: Stake-Sensitive Doxastic Policies  \nYet forming a credence of .3 is not the end of the story.  The agent must decide whether to close inquiry, adopt the proposition as a working premise, avow it publicly, bet, or withhold.  These are *actions* whose permissibility depends on the expected utility of their downstream consequences, combined with common-knowledge norms about assertion, promise, and reliance.  Crucially, one of these actions is *accepting* or *settling* the question\u2014\u200bmoving from a graded credence to a stable, belief-like commitment.  Whether that move is justified depends on practical stakes: a .8 credence is enough to believe when nothing important hangs on it, but not when lives are at stake.\n\nThe architecture therefore honours two normative principles:\n\nPriority:  Accuracy first.  You may not fudge your credences to suit your interests.  \n\nThreshold:  Acting-on, asserting, or believing-properly requires that your evidential support exceed a context-sensitive threshold determined by total expected cost of error.\n\nThe apparent need for cross-category weighing vanishes.  Practical reasons never *outweigh* evidence; they *adjust the threshold* at which it is permissible to treat a proposition as settled.  Epistemic reasons fix where on the probability scale you actually are; practical reasons govern which regions of that scale license commitment.\n\nIV.  How the Architecture Handles the Cases\n-------------------------------------------\n\nShipowner:  Step 1 condemns him already; he lacked sufficient evidence for \u201cthe ship is sound,\u201d so his credible accuracy-maximising credence should have been low.  Step 2 aggravates matters: given the catastrophic stakes, the threshold for treating seaworthiness as settled is extremely high\u2014\u200bclose to certainty.  He violates both directives, explaining our moral outrage.\n\nMedical Optimism:  Step 1 forbids the patient to adjust her credence beyond .3.  However, her physician may discern that publicly *asserting* \u201cYou will live\u201d could raise the survival rate.  If the physician does so transparently as a therapeutic intervention (and if such professional paternalism is permissible), then the action is justified at Step 2 without ever corrupting Step 1 credences.  Similarly, the patient might adopt deliberate *imaginative exercises* to increase motivation, all while recognising at the credence level that survival remains improbable.  The tension is resolved by separating belief-like motivational stances (policies) from outright credence.\n\nHigh-Stakes Bank:  Your evidence warrants, say, .95 that the cheque cleared.  Ordinarily .95 exceeds the default belief threshold (perhaps .9), but the surgery raises the threshold dramatically; until you gather more evidence you ought to suspend and check.  No need for incommensurable balancing: stakes merely raise the bar for settlement.\n\nV.  Why Not Call the Step-2 Threshold \u201cEpistemic\u201d?\n-------------------------------------------------\nSome will say I have simply relocated pragmatic encroachment, calling it \u201cpractical.\u201d  Yet the distinction is principled.  The accuracy norm (Step 1) is unconditional and agent-neutral; any inaccuracy is bad qua belief, even in worlds where it yields good consequences.  By contrast, threshold-setting is expressly agent- and context-relative, sensitive to utilities, and thus practical.  Conflating them obscures why the two rationales can pull apart: one can blame the shipowner\u2019s *belief* (Step 1) even if by dumb luck no passengers were harmed (so the Step 2 stakes vanished ex post).\n\nVI.  Transparency and the Control Objection\n-------------------------------------------\nBelief is often considered involuntary: one cannot believe at will what one takes to be false.  Does Step 2 therefore ask the impossible?  No.  The threshold concerns *when evidentially given credence licenses belief*: if the threshold is unmet, one withholds; if met, belief is a passive result.  Raising or lowering the threshold is not a matter of deciding to believe but of deciding whether to *let oneself* treat a question as closed given the stakes.  This is well within agential control: one can choose to keep investigating, to check one more source, or to remain agnostic\u2014\u200bas the bank customer does.\n\nVII.  Comparing With Competitors\n--------------------------------\n1.  Against Pragmatic Encroachment:  My view predicts the same stake-sensitivity for \u201cbelief-attribution\u201d phenomena (our reluctance to ascribe belief in high-stakes cases) but explains it without rewriting the constitutive aim of belief.  The aim remains accuracy, yet our ordinary *attributor*\u2019s standards for calling someone a \u201cbeliever\u201d track the Step-2 threshold.\n\n2.  Against Dual-Ought Impasse:  Because Step 1 has priority, genuine conflict is limited.  Practical reasons can never force you to adopt an inaccurate credence, only to keep inquiry open.  The two levels are thus ordered rather than co-equal, avoiding dilemmas.\n\n3.  Against Reductionism:  Truth is not integrated into a utilitarian calculus; it has lexicographic priority at Step 1.  So it will never be rational, on my view, to believe what you know is false because the payoff is great.  That honours the transparency of belief.\n\nVIII.  Non-Obvious Payoffs and Further Implications\n---------------------------------------------------\nA.  Normative Guidance for Scientists and Journalists  \nScientists often face practical pressure (funding, policy impact) to present findings as more certain than warranted.  The two-step model cleanly diagnoses such pressure as a Step-2 encroachment on a Step-1 norm and thus epistemically corrupting.\n\nB.  Epistemic Rights Analogous to Moral Rights  \nThe priority structure mirrors how moral theory sometimes treats rights: they are lexically prior to aggregate welfare but can be overridden only in catastrophic cases.  Likewise, epistemic accuracy has lexical priority, but practical catastrophe can impose a prohibitively high threshold for belief *settlement*.\n\nC.  Modelling in Decision Theory  \nWithin Bayesian decision theory, we can formalise the proposal: let Cr be fixed by evidential update rules (Jeffrey conditionalisation, etc.).  Let A be the set of possible belief-policies (settle, suspend, inquire further...).  Then choose the policy that maximises expected utility given Cr.  Because Cr is fixed first, utility never licenses doxastic distortion.  Thus we combine respect for the scoring-rule argument for epistemic rationality with pragmatic deliberation about what to do.\n\nIX.  Anticipating Objections\n----------------------------\n1.  \u201cSome practical reasons *seem* to justify belief-level distortion, e.g., self-deception that helps one survive.\u201d  \nReply: such cases reveal conflict between the aim of truth and the aim of survival.  They are tragic rather than resolved.  My model predicts the conflict: Step 1 forbids distortion; Step 2 may recommend actions (e.g., therapy) that incidentally shift credence by changing evidence (placebo outcomes).  But we should not redescribe self-deception as epistemically justified.\n\n2.  \u201cLexical priority is too rigid; sometimes a tiny benefit justifies belief distortion.\u201d  \nIntuitively, no amount of trivial benefit licenses believing what you regard as false.  If you can *regard as false* while believing, you are back to incoherence.  Lexical priority captures this transparency.  Where tiny benefit seems to tip the scales, closer inspection shows that evidence or thresholds, not credibility, changed (e.g., quick Google check).\n\n3.  \u201cHigh-stakes threshold raising implies contextualism about knowledge.\u201d  \nPerhaps, but the context dependence here concerns *permission to settle*, not truth conditions of \u2018knows\u2019.  One can combine the model with invariantist knowledge semantics while explaining pragmatic encroachment data as conversational implicature about stakes.\n\nX.  Conclusion\n--------------\nThe conflict between epistemic and practical reasons arises only if we demand a single weighing at a single deliberative point.  A more nuanced architecture assigns them separate, temporally ordered roles.  Epistemic reasons govern the formation of credence itself; practical reasons govern whether and how to act, speak, or close inquiry given that credence.  The interaction is not a matter of commensurable aggregation but of a priority rule plus stake-sensitive thresholds.  This framework preserves the constitutive aim of belief\u2014\u200btruth\u2014\u200bwhile vindicating our intuition that wisdom sometimes lies in withholding judgment until the stakes permit settlement.  Far from competing on the same scale, epistemic and practical reasons collaborate, each in its proper place, to guide the rational believer through a world where both accuracy and wellbeing matter.", "output_tokens": 3902, "reasoning_tokens": 768}

My thesis is that this diagnostic is half-right and half-wrong.  It is right that epistemic and practical reasons are not commensurable along a single quantitative scale, so attempts to assign each a cardinal number and add them up are misguided.  It is wrong, however, that this incommensurability prevents them from interacting in a rational, normatively unified way.  I shall argue for a two-stage, rank-order model:\n\nStage 1\u2014Epistemic Admissibility (EA):  Epistemic reasons have lexical priority.  They determine a set of doxastic options that are evidentially admissible\u2014roughly, propositions for which one\u2019s total evidence makes belief permissible rather than blameworthy.  If no proposition in some partition is admissible, the only admissible attitude toward members of that partition is suspension of judgment.\n\nStage 2\u2014Pragmatic Selection (PS):  Once the admissible set is fixed, practical reasons may legitimately tip the scales among the admissible attitudes.  Within that evidential \u201csafe zone,\u201d the belief one ought to adopt is whichever admissible attitude best promotes the relevant practical values (moral, prudential, political, or aesthetic) without violating the epistemic side-constraints set in Stage 1.\n\nBecause the stages are rank-ordered rather than quantifiably balanced, epistemic and practical reasons never compete head-to-head.  Each is sovereign in its own ordinal \u201cslot,\u201d yet together they generate an all-things-considered (\u201cATC\u201d) verdict about what it is rational to believe.  This structure preserves the intuitive hierarchy that truth-conduciveness matters more fundamentally than utility, while allowing the latter a genuine\u2014though constrained\u2014role in doxastic normativity.\n\nThe bulk of the essay develops, motivates, and defends this proposal.  I proceed as follows.  Section 1 formulates the problem more sharply and distinguishes four rival approaches.  Section 2 motivates the rank-order model and explicates its mechanics.  Section 3 offers two concrete cases\u2014a medical diagnosis and a court testimony scenario\u2014showing how the model yields plausible results where other views stumble.  Section 4 addresses five objections: (i) the charge of arbitrariness in giving lexical priority to epistemic reasons; (ii) the worry that doxastic involuntarism undermines any talk of \u201cought\u201d about belief; (iii) the concern that on highly consequential stakes, practical reasons ought to override evidence; (iv) the epistemic encroachment challenge that evidence itself shifts with stakes; and (v) the threat of fragmentation\u2014having too many \u201coughts\u201d with no unified rational perspective.  I close by gesturing toward research-level implications: the model illuminates the recently fashionable \u201cethics of belief\u201d literature, reshapes debates on faith and trust, and suggests a multi-level architecture for normativity more broadly.\n\n1.  Setting the Stage:  Why Simple Balancing Fails\n\nNotice first what the question is not.  It is not whether practical considerations ever causally influence what we in fact believe\u2014of course they do.  The issue is normative: do practical reasons bear on what we ought to believe, and if so, how can that normative interaction be coherent?\n\nFour prominent families of answer shape the current landscape.\n\n(a) Pure Evidentialism:  Only epistemic reasons determine doxastic \u201cought.\u201d  Practical considerations may influence whether we ought to act as though p, or gather more evidence, but never whether we ought to believe p.  This solves the incommensurability worry by fiat: there is nothing to commensurate.  The cost is that William James\u2019s \u201cWill to Believe,\u201d trust in friendship, and a host of moral-epistemic interactions become strictly irrational.\n\n(b) Simple Pragmatic Encroachment:  One overall utility function treats truth as just another good.  Epistemic and practical reasons enter a single maximization calculus.  This avoids the hard line of evidentialism but collapses truth into a fungible commodity.  If the stake is high enough you ought to believe the comforting falsehood\u2014an outcome many find repugnant.\n\n(c) Dual-Ought Pluralism:  There are two independent \u201coughts,\u201d epistemic and practical.  Each is internally consistent, and there is no further ATC verdict.  This honors the incommensurability intuition but yields a fragmented normative life: one might be epistemically obligated to believe \u00acp while practically obligated to believe p, with no rational standpoint telling you which route to take.\n\n(d) Threshold Views (James, Chignell, Peet):  Practical reasons matter only when evidence is indecisive or when the action outcome is momentous (\u201cforced options\u201d).  But threshold placements often look ad hoc, and the relation between undecided evidence and decisive practical stakes remains obscure.\n\nThe rank-order model I defend preserves what is compelling in (d) while avoiding its ad hocery, keeps the unity aspiration absent in (c), and evades the over-permissiveness of (b).  It does so by assigning epistemic reasons lexical priority over practical reasons, thereby mediating rather than merging them.\n\n2.  The Rank-Order Model Explained\n\n2.1  Lexical Priority and Side-Constraints\n\nWe commonly employ ordinal rankings elsewhere in ethics.  Kant\u2019s Formula of Humanity imposes side-constraints on utility maximization; Rawlsian justice gives basic liberties lexical priority over distributive efficiency.  The model\u2019s guiding thought is that believing on insufficient evidence is a kind of doxastic wrong akin to violating a right: it is something one simply must not do, no matter how convenient.\n\nFormally, let E be the evidential relation (strength of support), P the practical value relation, and S the set of candidate attitudes toward a proposition p: {believe p, disbelieve p, suspend}.  Define:\n\nEA-Permissibility:  \u03c6 \u2208 S is EA-permissible for agent A at time t iff holding \u03c6 does not violate the agent\u2019s epistemic obligations given her total evidence at t.\n\nPS-Superiority:  Among EA-permissible options, \u03c8 is PS-superior to \u03c6 iff \u03c8 yields greater expected practical value than \u03c6, holding fixed that both clear the epistemic bar.\n\nATC-Ought:  A oughtATC to adopt \u03c8 just in case (i) \u03c8 is EA-permissible, and (ii) \u03c8 is PS-superior to every other EA-permissible option.\n\nBecause (i) precedes (ii), practical considerations never override epistemic prohibitions; they only adjudicate ties or under-determined cases.  Yet their influence is real: when the evidence leaves multiple permissible attitudes open, the practically best of these becomes uniquely rational overall.\n\n2.2  How High the Epistemic Bar?\n\nOne worry about rank-ordering is that priority may be so strict that practical reasons never get purchase.  This, however, is a feature, not a bug.  Our intuitive judgments already reflect a shifting evidential bar tuned to context: what counts as \u201csufficient evidence\u201d for an idle conjecture differs from what suffices in a life-or-death setting.  The model accommodates this by letting the threshold of EA-permissibility itself be sensitive to domain-relative epistemic stakes\u2014e.g., scientific publication versus casual conversation\u2014yet remain independent of practical benefits of believing the proposition itself.  This preserves the idea that the currency of epistemic reasons is truth-conduciveness, not utility.\n\n2.3  Suspension as an Active Attitude\n\nAn under-appreciated merit of a two-stage framework is the substantive role it assigns to suspension of judgment.  If evidence underdetermines between p and \u00acp, EA often licenses suspension as one admissible option.  Practical reasons can then tip the balance between believing p and suspending, or between suspending and disbelieving.  Thus suspension is not a mere null state; it competes in Stage 2 and can win.\n\n3.  Two Illustrative Cases\n\nCase 1:  The Oncologist\u2019s Dilemma\n\nDr Lee must decide whether to tell her patient, Maria, that Maria likely has trefoil carcinoma.  The lab result shows a 0.55 probability of the disease; a further test will take three days, and early therapy is demanding.  Here are the salient factors:\n\nEvidence:  0.55 likelihood supports but does not compel belief that Maria has the cancer.\nPractical stakes:  Believing (and saying) p now causes Maria severe distress but may begin treatment sooner; disbelieving risks dangerous delay; suspension maintains hope but may postpone action.\n\nEA-Stage:  Both belief and suspension are EA-permissible (evidence >0.5 but not decisive); disbelief is not.\nPS-Stage:  Given Maria\u2019s robust preference to know early and the medical evidence on therapy timing, belief p yields higher expected welfare than suspension.\n\nATC verdict:  Dr Lee oughtATC to believe (and tell Maria) that she has trefoil carcinoma, even though her evidence would not have sufficed absent the clinical payoff.  The result matches intuitive judgments: the doctor\u2019s precaution to protect the patient by prompt action is rational, yet she would be culpable were the evidence materially weaker.\n\nNote that simple pragmatic encroachment would permit belief even at 0.2 probability if the therapy stakes were high; while evidentialism would forbid belief at 0.55 probability until further tests arrive.  The rank-order model captures the middle ground.\n\nCase 2:  The Friend on the Stand\n\nYou are a juror; your lifelong friend Sam is accused of embezzlement.  The prosecution\u2019s evidence convinces a reasonable observer to 0.8 credence in Sam\u2019s guilt.  Your friendship yields a strong practical desire to believe Sam innocent, but nothing that bears on truth.\n\nEA-Stage:  Given the criminal-court context (where stakes include depriving liberty) the evidential bar is high: belief in innocence is EA-impermissible; at best, suspension might be permissible if you discount minor inconsistencies.\nPS-Stage:  Friendship's value cannot rescue belief in innocence because that option was excluded in Stage 1.  Practical reasons may recommend suspension rather than belief in guilt if that is still EA-permissible, but here the evidence is overwhelming, so suspension is also barred.\n\nVerdict:  You oughtATC to believe Sam guilty.  The model explains why: practical considerations never got a seat at the table because epistemic side-constraints closed off the friend-protecting option.  By contrast, simple encroachment would risk jury nullification, and dual-ought pluralism would leave you torn between epistemic and prudential mandates.\n\n4.  Objections and Replies\n\nObjection 1:  \u201cLexical priority looks dogmatic.  Why privilege truth over welfare?\u201d  \nReply:  First, treating truth as a side-constraint mirrors our moral practice: we regard belief on grossly insufficient evidence as an intellectual wrong, not merely a sub-optimal strategy.  Second, priority can be grounded in the constitutive aim of belief: to represent the world correctly.  Beliefs that flout that aim for gain cease to be genuine beliefs and become mere make-believe or acceptance.  Hence the lexical order is not arbitrary but flows from what believing is.\n\nObjection 2:  \u201cBelief isn\u2019t a voluntary act; \u2018ought implies can.\u2019\u201d  \nReply:  While belief is not directly voluntary, we exercise doxastic agency via indirect control\u2014seeking or avoiding evidence, attending to counter-considerations, entering epistemic contexts like jury duty.  Norms of belief govern these upstream actions and attitudes.  The rank-order model focuses on permissible belief states, leaving room that sometimes you simply cannot help but believe; in those cases, the \u2018ought\u2019 applies to the management of evidence, not to the brute mental occurrence.\n\nObjection 3:  \u201cIn catastrophic stakes\u2014say, believing that a nuclear attack is imminent\u2014you ought to believe the warning even on meager evidence.\u201d  \nReply:  Our framework captures that intuition through two mechanisms.  First, the heightened domain stakes legitimately lower the evidential threshold (EA) for permissible belief; civil defense contexts treat false negatives as costlier than false positives, so weaker evidence suffices.  Second, once belief becomes EA-permissible, overwhelming practical stakes will dominate Stage 2.  What cannot happen is believe-p on no evidence at all; the evidence bar may drop, but it never vanishes.\n\nObjection 4:  \u201cEpistemic encroachmentists argue that stakes affect knowledge-level evidence directly; your model separates the axes.\u201d  \nReply:  Both views agree that stakes matter; the dispute is where they enter.  My model affords an explanatory edge: it differentiates two conceptually distinct routes stakes can travel, avoiding awkward claims that the probability of p conditional on e itself shifts with utility.  It captures pragmatic encroachment phenomena while honoring Bayesian evidence.\n\nObjection 5:  \u201cYou now have three oughts\u2014epistemic, practical, ATC.  Isn\u2019t that messy?\u201d  \nReply:  Rational life is messy.  Yet the model reinstates unity at the ATC level, leaving the sub-oughts as diagnostic tools.  This is precisely how we handle moral side-constraints in action: legality, morality, prudence, and etiquette generate domain-relative norms, yet we strive for an integrated decision.  The theory\u2019s architecture mirrors that successful practice.\n\n5.  Broader Implications and Novel Directions\n\n5.1  Faith, Trust, and Testimony\n\nMany real-world beliefs live in evidential penumbra: faith commitments, trusting a partner\u2019s love, interpreting a friend\u2019s opaque statement.  The rank-order framework suggests that epistemic permissibility for such attitudes is often thin but non-zero, opening the door for practical values\u2014solidarity, intimacy\u2014to tip the balance.  It thereby vindicates but constrains Jamesian permission.\n\n5.2  Epistemic Wrongs and Moral Blame\n\nIf believing on insufficient evidence wrongs particular persons (e.g., racial profiling), then epistemic side-constraints are not just self-regarding duties but other-directed.  The proposal supplies a principled account of such epistemic injustice: to believe a demeaning stereotype is EA-impermissible because the evidence is wanting; hence no amount of personal comfort can salvage it.\n\n5.3  Multi-Level Normative Theory\n\nFinally, the rank-order pattern may have wider reach.  Consider environmental policy: scientific constraints determine an admissible set of forecasts, within which economic and ethical considerations choose the policy.  Or consider medical ethics: first, identify permissible treatments; second, weigh patient values.  The epistemic\u2013practical structure of belief could thus model a general architecture for practical rationality.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe alleged incommensurability of epistemic and practical reasons is real but not paralyzing.  By giving epistemic reasons lexical priority\u2014thus generating a set of evidentially admissible attitudes\u2014and allowing practical reasons to adjudicate within that set, we attain a coherent, unified, and normatively attractive account of what one ought to believe.  This rank-order model honors the constitutive commitment of belief to truth while respecting the legitimate pull of moral and prudential stakes.  It also illuminates a range of concrete cases and opens a promising template for integrating domain-specific normativities beyond epistemology.  A satisfactory ethics of belief must, I submit, adopt something in this spirit, or else resign itself to either implausible purism or disintegrated pluralism.", "output_tokens": 4059, "reasoning_tokens": 704}

The Problem Restated\n\nTwo species of reasons are routinely cited as bearing on belief:\n\n\u2022 Epistemic reasons: considerations that speak in favour of a belief by indicating its truth (e.g. perceptual evidence, statistical data, testimonial reliability).\n\n\u2022 Practical reasons: considerations that speak in favour of a belief by indicating its value or disvalue for the believer or others (e.g. that holding the belief will prevent panic, foster solidarity, or avoid moral harm).\n\nIndividually, each domain seems intelligible: when the only thing at stake is getting the facts right, epistemic reasons dominate; when the only thing at stake is welfare, practical reasons dominate.  The puzzle arises when both kinds of reasons are present and sharply point in opposite directions.  Suppose a nurse can see from the chart that the prognosis is terminal (strong epistemic reason to believe \u201cthe patient will die\u201d), yet also knows that if she firmly believes that proposition she will, owing to past trauma, become paralysed with grief and give sub-standard care (strong practical reason not to believe it).  How, in one single deliberation, can she sensibly \u201cweigh\u201d a consideration about truth against a consideration about professional competence and patient wellbeing?  The two reasons seem incommensurable; there is no obvious common currency\u2014no metric that simultaneously measures truth-conduciveness and moral stakes.\n\nA tempting conclusion, drawn by \u201cepistemic purists,\u201d is that the puzzle shows practical reasons never bear on what we ought to believe.  They bear on what we ought to *desire* or *do*, but not what we ought to *believe*.  Conversely, pragmatists such as James and contemporary \u201cpragmatic encroachers\u201d argue that the puzzle shows the opposite: once the stakes are high enough, epistemic requirements yield, so belief is directly responsive to practical reasons.  Neither manoeuvre treats the phenomenon head-on.  Implacable purism leaves vast swathes of ordinary normative discourse apparently nonsensical (\u201cDon\u2019t believe the gossip\u2014it could ruin her reputation!\u201d), while unrestrained pragmatism risks collapsing the very idea that beliefs aim at truth.\n\nMy thesis is that the impasse comes from a false presupposition\u2014that there must be a single, fully commensurable *weighing* of reasons.  Once we replace the monolithic picture with a layered model of doxastic normativity, the puzzle dissolves.  Epistemic and practical reasons belong to distinct normative layers that have different deontic operators (requirements, permissions, and prohibitions).  What we *overall* ought to believe is determined not by putting the two kinds of reasons on the same scale, but by a structured interaction: epistemic reasons set a *credal floor* (how favourable the evidence must be before a belief even becomes *candidates for adoption*), whereas practical reasons select among the epistemically permitted options by raising *stakes-sensitive thresholds* for outright belief versus suspended judgement.  The layers are connected but not collapsed, yielding principled interaction without needing an impossible cardinal comparison.\n\n\n2. Preliminaries: Four Important Distinctions\n\nTo see how the model works, we must get clear on four distinctions often run together in the literature.\n\n2.1. Doxastic States vs. Doxastic Policies  \nA *state* is the belief itself; a *policy* is a standing manner of responding to evidence.  Practical reasons typically attach to policies (\u201cCultivate a cautious attitude about gossip; it can harm innocents\u201d), whereas epistemic reasons more typically attach to current states (\u201cThe photo clearly shows the suspect\u201d).  The layer model treats policy-level and state-level justification separately.\n\n2.2. Permission vs. Requirement  \nMany discussions assume that reasons always issue in a ranking.  But often epistemic reasons issue in *permissions*: if the evidence is 55\u201360 % favours p, belief might be *permissible* though not *required*.  That slack is exactly where practical reasons can do real work, because they can change which of the *permissible* doxastic responses one should, all-things-considered, adopt.\n\n2.3. Pro Tanto vs. All-Things-Considered Ought  \nA reason can make a belief prima facie justified without determining the de dicto \u201cought\u201d.  The puzzle mistakenly assumes we must do a single summing-up at one level; but often distinct kinds of \u201coughts\u201d govern the same token belief.\n\n2.4. Accuracy Value vs. Endorsement Utility  \nTruth is valuable in at least two conceptually different ways.  An *accuracy* value is constitutive: it inheres in the belief as such.  A belief can also have *utility* owing to its downstream effects (e.g. placebo benefits).  Recognising the difference allows us to let accuracy play a unique role at the epistemic layer without denying that utility has genuine normative force at another.\n\n\n3. The Layered Model in Outline\n\nLayer 1: Epistemic Rationality.  \nThe agent must place her credence c(p) so that it fits her total evidence E under familiar norms (e.g. Bayesian conditionalisation).  The epistemic reasons here answer solely to truth-conduciveness; practical considerations are literally silent.  Output: a *credence interval* specifying for each proposition a range compatible with epistemic rationality.\n\nLayer 2: Doxastic Discretion.  \nBecause outright belief (as opposed to graded credence) is a coarse-grained, action-relevant attitude, we need thresholds: t-accept for moving from credence to belief, and t-reject for moving to disbelief.  The key move: these thresholds are *rationally underdetermined* by Layer 1.  Any thresholds that respect probability axioms could in principle be adopted.\n\nPractical reasons enter precisely here.  High-stakes contexts push t-accept upwards (you should not believe hurricane landfall predictions until 95 % confident because evacuation decisions hang on them); low-stakes contexts relax the threshold (you may believe your friend is home with only 60 % evidence when popping by for coffee).  The practical reasons thus do not directly alter the credence, nor do they directly instruct \u201cbelieve p even though the evidence is poor.\u201d  They determine when the move from credence to binary belief is practically apt.  Output: a *permitted doxastic profile*\u2014a set of outright beliefs, disbeliefs, and suspensions that are both epistemically permissible and practically appropriate, given the chosen thresholds.\n\nLayer 3: Policy Coherence and Moral Constraints.  \nBeyond individual beliefs, there are reasons concerning whole patterns\u2014avoid biases, uphold testimonial justice, refrain from doxastic wronging.  These are again practical (moral or prudential) but of a *second order*: they target policies governing layers 1\u20132.  For instance, deference to marginalised testimony can lower your effective t-accept for certain speakers.  Output: refined constraints on which threshold settings themselves are permissible.\n\nLayer 4: Integrative All-Things-Considered Verdict.  \nFinally, the agent asks: Which doxastic profile and which policy jointly satisfy (i) epistemic permissibility, (ii) stakes-sensitive thresholds, and (iii) higher-order moral constraints?  If there is at least one profile satisfying all three, the agent is *obliged* to adopt some member of that set; she is free to choose within it.  If there is no profile satisfying all three, we have a genuine normative conflict (akin to moral dilemmas), and second-best principles\u2014e.g. minimising expected regret under each value dimension\u2014kick in.\n\n\n4. How the Model Dissolves the Incommensurability Worry\n\n4.1. No Direct Cardinal Comparison Required  \nAt no point do we ask: \u201cHow many microns of truth accuracy outweigh how many microns of moral harm?\u201d  Instead, each layer comes with its own deontic structure and parameters.  Their interaction is mediated structurally\u2014through slack in thresholds, permissions, and policy choice\u2014rather than additively.\n\n4.2. Explaining Ordinary Judgements  \n\u2022 James\u2019s famous \u201cwill to believe\u201d cases.  The mountaineer\u2019s evidence that the jump is survivable is middling.  Epistemic layer says belief is merely permissible.  Practical layer (courage needed to leap) raises the stakes and thereby pushes her to adopt belief.  We can vindicate James without sacrificing the evidential constraint.\n\n\u2022 The terminal prognosis nurse.  Here, evidence makes belief required: credence must exceed t-accept even on a high threshold.  Practical reasons push oppositely but can *at most* lower t-accept or counsel suspension if psychologically feasible.  They cannot license outright disbelief, for that would violate layer 1.  So the rational course is: maintain belief (perhaps only privately) but adopt coping measures\u2014seek support, compartmentalise\u2014because practical reasons are redirected at policy-level behaviour, not at defeating the belief itself.\n\n\u2022 The conspiracy theorist.  Evidence is far below even a lenient threshold.  Practical reasons (it is fun, it bonds him with friends) are strong but cannot turn epistemic impermissibility into permissibility.  Hence he ought not believe, full stop.\n\n4.3. Why Competing Monistic Accounts Falter  \n\u2022 Purism cannot explain permissible belief in high-stakes, low-evidence everyday contexts (trusting the bus timetable to plan dinner).  \n\u2022 Pragmatic encroachment says the *evidence itself* is less than decisive unless the practical stakes are low, but critics rightly complain that this conflates an evidential norm with a pragmatic payoff function.  The layered model preserves pure evidential import at Layer 1 yet captures stake-sensitivity at Layer 2, avoiding the \u201cepistemology in thrall to the weather report\u201d worry.\n\n\n5. Objections and Replies\n\nObjection 1: The Model Merely Relocates Commensurability.  Aren\u2019t thresholds still numbers that need balancing truth and utility?\n\nReply: The thresholds must be *fixed* somewhere, yes, but they are coarse ordinal parameters, not fine-grained utility translations.  Any pair (t-accept, t-reject) that satisfies certain rational constraints (e.g. t-accept \u2265 .5 \u2265 t-reject) is *epistemically allowable.*  Practical reasons need only select within that permitted space.  Comparing her trauma risk with accuracy need not produce a cardinal trade-off; she can say, \u201cGiven the foreseeable harm, I\u2019ll set t-accept at .85 for this proposition.\u201d  That judgement is perfectly intelligible even if she cannot monetise truth-value.\n\nObjection 2: The model over-intellectualises belief.  Ordinary believers do not set thresholds explicitly.\n\nReply: The model is a *normative reconstruction*, not a psychological record.  Just as moral philosophy distinguishes implicit principles from explicit reasoning, epistemic philosophy can hold that agents are implicitly committed to threshold-like policies; their permissibility does not depend on the agent\u2019s articulacy.\n\nObjection 3: What about diachronic constraints?  Won\u2019t changing thresholds on the fly invite irrational wishful thinking?\n\nReply: Higher-order Policy Coherence (Layer 3) rules this out: thresholds must be *prospectively* adoptable and *publicly defensible*.  This forbids ad hoc lowering t-accept only for the proposition that I will win the lottery tomorrow.  Legitimate practical pressure must appeal to general policy features (e.g. \u201cwhen the downside of error is catastrophic, require stronger evidence\u201d).\n\nObjection 4: Why doesn\u2019t the model force us sometimes to hold inconsistent beliefs?  E.g. Evidential reasons force belief in p, moral reasons forbid it; result: both believe and not believe p.\n\nReply: The layer model distinguishes requirements and permissions.  If epistemic reasons *require* believing p but moral reasons *forbid* believing p, the set of permissible profiles is empty, yielding a genuine dilemma.  The correct verdict is that the agent is in tragic normative conflict, analogous to being required to keep a promise and to save a drowning child when both cannot be done.  That result is a virtue, not a vice: it reflects the tragic structure of certain real cases.\n\n\n6. Substantive Pay-Offs\n\n6.1. A New Framing of \u201cDoxastic Wronging\u201d  \nOn the layered model, the wronging does not lie in believing against the evidence (that would be a Layer-1 violation) but in setting one\u2019s policy thresholds in a way that is insensitive to the speaker\u2019s socially vulnerable position (Layer 3).  That reframes ongoing debates by isolating the moral fault at policy level, not at the belief state itself.\n\n6.2. Implications for Epistemic Blame  \nBlame can now be apportioned more finely: we may epistemically blame Sally for credence mismanagement, but morally blame her policy of double-standards, even when the final belief happens to be true.\n\n6.3. Research Programme on Stake-Sensitive Thresholds  \nOnce thresholds are foregrounded as the locus of practical influence, empirical psychology (signal detection theory, risk perception) becomes directly relevant to epistemic normativity.  This opens a line of interdisciplinary work on calibrating rational thresholds in medicine, law, and public policy.\n\n6.4. Hybrid Virtues  \nVirtues like \u201cepistemic courage\u201d or \u201copen-mindedness\u201d can now be understood as dispositions that reliably set thresholds and policies so as to navigate the interface between truth and value.  The model thus grounds what virtue epistemologists have intuited but lacked formal articulation.\n\n\n7. Comparison with Alternative Integration Strategies\n\nVector Model (Fantl & McGrath).  \nThey propose literal summing of epistemic and practical vectors.  Critics doubt the dimensional commensurability.  The layered model agrees that vectors are handy but limits them to Layer 2 where credence manipulation isn\u2019t at issue, sidestepping the worst objections.\n\nDual-Ought Theory (Lord, Kiesewetter).  \nThey posit separate epistemic and practical oughts and deny an overall ought.  While this secures clarity, it renders everyday advice (\u201cYou ought not believe the rumour\u2014it\u2019s harmful and unfounded\u201d) strictly speaking false.  Our layered model allows an all-things-considered ought without sacrificing domain autonomy.\n\nGradualist Pragmatic Encroachment (Weatherson).  \nHe suggests evidential standards rise with stakes.  Our model incorporates that insight but identifies *how* they rise: by adjusting the acceptance threshold, not by changing what counts as evidence, thus maintaining an unsullied evidentialist core.\n\n\n8. A Striking Example: The Disaster Siren\n\nConsider a coastal town with a tsunami warning system.  The evidence from undersea sensors is equivocal\u2014only 40 % chance of an actual wave.  Yet sounding the siren will trigger costly evacuations and economic disruption.  The authority must decide what to believe about an \u201cimminent tsunami\u201d so as to communicate honestly to the public.\n\nLayer 1: Evidence disfavours p (\u201cA tsunami is imminent\u201d); so believing p is epistemically forbidden; disbelief is permissible.\n\nLayer 2: Practical stakes are life-and-death.  That raises t-accept for belief in \u00acp to an unusually high requirement (say 90 %).  Since the authority\u2019s credence in no tsunami is 60 %, this fails.  Hence outright disbelief is *practically* impermissible.  Suspension of judgement is the only stance that survives Layers 1\u20132.\n\nLayer 3: Emergency protocols impose a moral policy: if suspension is the attitude and warning systems are below 70 % reliable, the siren must sound.  That is an *action* norm triggered by a doxastic state norm.  The authority\u2019s final all-things-considered stance: suspend belief and evacuate.  Notice how the seemingly intractable evidence\u2013value tension is resolved without pretending one can numerically trade lives against epistemic accuracy.\n\n\n9. Conclusion\n\nThe purported incommensurability of epistemic and practical reasons for belief arises only if we assume a single-stage weighing model with a total ranking of heterogeneous values.  By moving to a layered framework\u2014where epistemic reasons govern credence placement, practical reasons govern threshold selection, and higher-order moral reasons govern policy coherence\u2014we can make sense of their joint normative force without inventing a mythical common currency.  The scalar properties of beliefs (graded credence vs. binary belief), together with the permission\u2013requirement gap, provide the needed \u201cdegrees of freedom\u201d through which practical considerations operate.  The model honours an evidentialist core (truth still sets the baseline) while capturing the pervasive way stakes, values, and moral relationships legitimately influence what we responsibly commit ourselves to believing.\n\nFar from being awkward accretions, practical reasons turn out to be built-in modulators of doxastic attitudes at precisely those junctures where epistemic norms leave room for discretion.  Once that architecture is in view, familiar puzzles\u2014James\u2019s pass, Pascal\u2019s wager, doxastic wronging, pragmatic encroachment\u2014slot neatly into place, and new research avenues open for formal epistemology, moral psychology, and virtue theory.  The supposedly \u201cimpossible\u201d reckoning between truth and value becomes instead a structured partnership: truth sets the stage, value scripts the performance.", "output_tokens": 4498, "reasoning_tokens": 768}

Setting the Problem\n\nA doctor considers whether to inform a patient that her condition is terminal. The evidence is ambiguous: a 55% probability of rapid decline, 45% of full recovery. Purely epistemic considerations\u2014truth-conduciveness\u2014counsel withholding the terminal diagnosis. Yet the doctor also knows that believing recovery is possible motivates patients to adhere to physiotherapy regimens. Practical considerations\u2014welfare, hope, autonomy\u2014thus speak in favor of cultivating the optimistic belief.  \n\nCases of this kind generate the central puzzle. Epistemic reasons (ERs) concern the *truth* of propositions. Practical reasons (PRs) concern the *good* that believing those propositions would bring about. If both kinds of reasons are genuine, how do they interact to yield the overall \u201call-things\u2010considered\u201d doxastic verdict? Talk of \u201cweighing\u201d seems inappropriate: truth and good are qualitatively different. The intuitive worry is one of *incommensurability*.  \n\nI defend a two-level, threshold-sensitive model that (i) preserves the distinctness of ERs and PRs, (ii) makes philosophical sense of their joint relevance, and (iii) explains away the appearance of impossible commensuration. Roughly: ERs normally dominate; PRs operate as *exclusionary* second-order reasons (\u00e0 la Raz) that silence ERs only when they pass a pragmatic severity threshold. Under that condition, PRs do not \u201coutweigh\u201d ERs on a single scale; they *pre-empt* them by altering which deliberative framework is appropriate. The upshot is a structured interaction rather than a literal comparison of weights.\n\n2. Clarifying the Terrain\n\n2.1 What Counts as a Reason?\n\nI follow a broadly *buck-passing* conception: a reason is a consideration that counts *in favor of* some response. Reasons need not share a common measure; they simply have normative force. We can, however, classify them by the *kind* of response they favor. ERs favor believing *p* because *p* is (likely) true. PRs favor believing *p* because believing *p* promotes independent goods.\n\n2.2 Two Senses of \u201cOught\u201d\n\nPhilosophers sometimes oscillate between:  \n\n(i) Domain-relative oughts: you *epistemically ought* to believe whatever is best supported by your evidence.  \n(ii) All-things-considered (ATC) ought: you *ought simpliciter* to form the attitude best supported by *all* reasons.\n\nThe hard question concerns (ii). The options in the literature:\n\nA. Reductionism: Only ERs are genuine reasons for belief (Clifford, Adler). PRs merely motivate, not justify.  \nB. Pragmatic Encroachment: ERs already include utility considerations (Fantl & McGrath).  \nC. Jamesian Permissivism: PRs matter only in evidential *ties* (William James).  \nD. Syncategorematic Pluralism: ERs and PRs both matter, but we lack a principled integration story.\n\nApproach D concedes the very puzzle we face. I aim to move beyond that impasse.\n\n3. Why Literal Commensuration is Unpromising\n\nSuppose we attempt a cardinal scale: assign \u201cevidential weight\u201d numeric values and \u201cpractical value\u201d utilitarian utils; then add or trade off. Three difficulties arise:\n\na. Ontological mismatch: probability of truth and quantity of welfare are not obvious currency-converts.  \nb. Fanaticism worry: tiny evidential improvements could be swamped by colossal utility payoffs (or vice versa) producing intuitively absurd prescriptions.  \nc. Epistemic status of the metric itself: establishing the commensuration rule would require higher-order justification we conspicuously lack.\n\nTherefore, the most promising road is *structural*, not metric: specify which kind of reason has priority under which conditions.\n\n4. The Two-Level, Threshold-Sensitive Model\n\n4.1 Belief as a Role-Executed Attitude\n\nBelief has at least two functions.  \nRepresentational: aim at accurate world-mapping.  \nAgency-supporting: guide action in ways that promote flourishing.\n\nBecause the representational role is constitutive of *belief as such*, ERs enjoy *default priority*. If you routinely form beliefs insensitive to evidence, you stop manifesting the belief role at all\u2014you lapse into make-believe or wishful fancy. So any model that gives PRs automatic lexical priority violates the constitutive aim of belief.\n\n4.2 Razian Exclusionary Reasons\n\nJoseph Raz distinguishes:\n\u2022 First-order reason: counts directly toward an action.  \n\u2022 Second-order *exclusionary* reason: a reason not to act on certain first-order reasons.\n\nI propose: decisive PRs operate at the second order. They do not outweigh ERs; they *instruct* the agent to exclude some ERs from deliberation. Think of confidentiality rules in journalism: normally one ought to report truth, but when national security considerations arise, that higher-order reason forbids publishing even well-verified leaks.\n\n4.3 The Pragmatic Severity Threshold\n\nWhen do PRs attain exclusionary force? Introduce a pragmatic severity threshold T, informally: \u201cstakes so high that reasonable persons treat representational accuracy as defeasible.\u201d Candidate criteria:\n\n(a) Catastrophic consequence magnitude (e.g., existential risk)  \n(b) Dominance: No action policy yields higher expected value unless the belief is treated as practically decisive.  \n(c) Counterfactual E-PR gap: The epistemic gain from aligning with truth is marginal relative to the practical cost.\n\nCrossing T triggers the higher-order mandate: \u201cTemporarily suspend evidentialism; adopt the practically-mandated credence.\u201d Below T, stick to ERs.\n\n4.4 No Need for Scalar Weights\n\nBecause PRs, when severe enough, *silence* rather than *balance* ERs, the model dispenses with commensuration. We employ a *lexicographic* or two-stage decision rule:\n\nStage 1: Evaluate *T*.  \nIf T < threshold, believe per ERs.  \nIf T \u2265 threshold, follow PRs and ignore conflicting ERs for the duration of the high-stakes context.\n\n5. Illuminating Examples\n\nExample 1: The Minefield Scout  \nA reconnaissance drone relays 70% reliable data that Route A is safe, 30% Route B. A platoon must pick a path. If wrong, ten soldiers die. The pragmatic stakes (lives) cross T. The commander assigns credence 50/50 and orders additional caution rather than confidently choosing A. PRs exclude the ER advantage of A because the marginal evidential benefit is swamped by life-or-death stakes.\n\nExample 2: Self-Diagnosis on the Internet  \nA layperson suspects meningitis after reading WebMD. The evidence is weak. Practical stakes\u2014possible fatal outcome\u2014cross T, making \u201cseek immediate care\u201d rational, but *believing* one certainly has meningitis is not required; the high stakes demand a course of action, not a contrary belief. Here the threshold triggers only action, not belief revision, because the agent can mitigate harm without adopting the belief. This shows the model doesn\u2019t encourage indiscriminate wishful belief; exclusion applies only when the beneficial action *depends* on belief.\n\nExample 3: The Comforting Lie  \nParent knows Santa isn\u2019t real. PRs (child\u2019s wonder) don\u2019t plausibly cross T; the stakes are minor. ERs remain decisive: the parent should not *believe* in Santa. She may, of course, perpetuate a game, but that is pragmatically permitted *pretense*, not doxastic revision. The model vindicates intuitive verdicts.\n\n6. Objections and Replies\n\nObjection 1: Doxastic Voluntarism  \nBelief isn\u2019t directly under voluntary control; so how can exclusionary PRs command belief revision?  \n\nReply: The model requires only *indirect control*: attending to differential evidence, rehearsal, or doxastic dispositions (e.g., \u201cgive the optimistic interpretation\u201d). Empirical psychology shows graded voluntary influence (confirmation bias, framing). Norms can govern such control points.\n\nObjection 2: Fanatic Thresholds  \nWon\u2019t agents abuse T, claiming every convenience is high stakes?  \n\nReply: T is keyed to intersubjective standards\u2014catastrophic loss, rights violations, or moral emergencies. Socially embedded epistemic norms (medicine, engineering, law) already operationalize such thresholds (e.g., \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt,\u201d \u201cprecautionary principle\u201d). Abuse can be criticized as mis\u2010calibration, not conceptual incoherence.\n\nObjection 3: Epistemic Integrity  \nDoesn\u2019t silencing ERs compromise the very nature of belief?  \n\nReply: Only temporarily and under extremity. Compare emergency triage overriding normal medical protocol: integrity is compatible with structured override rules. Indeed, acknowledging exceptional clauses can *protect* epistemic integrity by preventing creeping pragmatic encroachment in mundane contexts.\n\nObjection 4: Redundancy with Pragmatic Encroachment Theories  \nCouldn\u2019t we simply say stakes affect the *standard of knowledge* (Fantl & McGrath) rather than posit exclusionary reasons?  \n\nReply: Pragmatic encroachment collapses the distinction between ERs and PRs, implying that the *truth-aim* of belief is itself utility-dependent. My account preserves the conceptual purity of ERs while explaining stake sensitivity at the metanormative level. It thereby retains the explanatory virtues of evidentialism where they matter most (science, ordinary inquiry) without treating those domains as error-laden.\n\n7. Advantages Over Rivals\n\nJamesian Permissivism grants PR sway only in evidential ties, but many cases involve slight ER imbalances. The threshold model handles them gracefully.  \n\nFull Pragmatism (Peirce, Rescher) makes truth just another utility; it struggles to explain why scientific norms resist practical pressures. Our model accounts for that resistance: thresholds are rarely crossed in laboratories.\n\nReductionism about PRs fails to capture morally charged cases\u2014e.g., police lineup identifications where a false belief can ruin a life. The threshold model honors those moral realities without abandoning truth-aim as the default.\n\n8. Theoretical Payoff: A Unified Yet Plural Normativity\n\nThe proposal yields a *dualist* but integrated picture. Reasons remain heterogeneous, yet agents possess a clear decision procedure:\n\n1. Classify the context\u2019s stakes.  \n2. If below threshold, obey evidentialism.  \n3. If above, apply the pragmatic exclusionary directive.\n\nWe obtain an ATC ought that is neither mysterious alloy nor crude arithmetic. It is a *rule-governed ordering* of reason-domains.\n\n9. Philosophical Ramifications\n\n9.1 Epistemic Responsibility and Moral Luck  \nThe view illuminates why we sometimes blame agents for belief\u2010formation (anti-vaxxers in public health crises) even when they cite mountains of \u201cresearch.\u201d The miscalibration of T\u2014failure to recognize public-welfare stakes\u2014renders their exclusion of credible ERs culpable.\n\n9.2 Higher-Order Evidence  \nWhen observers note that \u201cso much is at stake,\u201d that itself becomes *higher-order evidence* about T. The theory predicts complex feedback between epistemic and practical domains, a fertile terrain for future research.\n\n9.3 Relation to Self-Deception  \nSelf-deception can now be analyzed as illicit, sub-threshold invocation of PRs\u2014treating trivial comforts as if they crossed T. This reframing might inform psychological therapy aimed at recalibrating threshold sensitivity rather than merely debunking false premises.\n\n10. Conclusion\n\nEpistemic and practical reasons need not be weighed on a single scale. Instead, they interact hierarchically: evidential considerations govern belief by default, while sufficiently weighty practical stakes give rise to second-order exclusionary reasons that silence but do not balance those evidential considerations. The decisive mechanism is a pragmatic severity threshold, conceptually akin to emergency protocols in other normative domains. This two-level, threshold-sensitive account preserves the constitutive truth-aim of belief, respects the moral significance of doxastic states, and dissolves the specter of incommensurability without forcing a reductive unification. It thereby offers a principled, workable answer to the question of how we ought\u2014*all things considered*\u2014to believe.", "output_tokens": 3027, "reasoning_tokens": 320}

Framing the Puzzle\n\nWe seem to recognize two kinds of reasons for belief. Epistemic reasons track truth: that the thermometer reads 39 \u00b0C is a reason to believe I have a fever because such readings are reliably truth-conducive. Practical reasons track value: that believing I will recover quickly increases my odds of recovery may be a reason\u2014of a very different stripe\u2014to hold that optimistic belief. The intuitive tension is vivid in James\u2019s \u201cWill to Believe,\u201d Pascal\u2019s wager, and contemporary debates over \u201cpragmatic encroachment.\u201d The difficulty is not merely cataloguing two reason\u2010types; it is explaining how one could ever arrive at a single verdict about what one ought, simpliciter, to believe when the inputs appear normatively incommensurable. We cannot, it seems, take 0.7 units of evidence and add 3.2 units of moral value to produce an \u201call-things-considered\u201d score.\n\nMy thesis is that the demand for cardinal commensuration is a false lead. Epistemic and practical reasons interact not by being weighed on a shared scale but by being ordered: epistemic reasons set a threshold of permissibility, and practical reasons select among the epistemically permissive options (sometimes collapsing them into one by disqualifying all but the practically best). The ordering is lexicographic\u2014truth takes structural priority\u2014but it is not absolutist, because once epistemic adequacy is secured, practical stake-sensitivity rightly decides which permissible belief one ought to embrace. This two-stage, threshold-lexicographic model dissolves the incommensurability worry while preserving the distinctive normative signatures of each reason-type.\n\n2. Clarifying the Players\n\n2.1 Epistemic reasons. Call R\u2091 p\u2019s being a reason of type E to believe proposition p just in case R\u2091 increases p\u2019s likelihood of truth or manifests a reliable truth-conducive process. These reasons are detachable from any practical pay-off: the thermometer\u2019s reading counts even if I do not care about my temperature.\n\n2.2 Practical reasons. Call R\u209a a practical reason to believe p just in case R\u209a bears on the value (prudential, moral, aesthetic, etc.) expected to accrue were I to believe p, irrespective of p\u2019s truth. Placebo effects, moral encroachment (\u201cit would be terrible to accept testimony that demeans this group\u201d), and religious consolation are paradigm sources.\n\n2.3 Two \u201coughts\u201d or one? Some writers propose a clean disambiguation: an epistemic ought and a practical ought that never merge. But the folk concept of belief is not so neatly bifurcated. We blame the conspiracy theorist not merely for having an epistemically defective belief but full stop; we praise the patient who faces evidence of terminal illness squarely even at pragmatic cost. There is pressure for a genuinely all-things-considered ought governing belief.\n\n3. Why Cardinal Commensuration Is Unpromising\n\nAttempts to assign cardinal weights to each reason\u2010type (e.g. convert \u201ctruth-likelihood\u201d into expected value units or vice-versa) founder on several empirical and conceptual obstacles.\n\n   \u2022 Truth is plausibly non-instrumental; its value is not straightforwardly fungible with well-being units.\n\n   \u2022 Practical reasons can be plural and incommensurable even among themselves (moral vs prudential), so shoehorning all value into a single utility metric already faces deep problems prior to mixing in truth.\n\n   \u2022 The very point of calling something an epistemic norm has been to insulate it from precisely such trade-offs; total commensuration would collapse that distinctive role.\n\nIf a plausible integrative theory exists, it must respect the heterogeneity of currencies. That is what the threshold-lexicographic approach aims to do.\n\n4. The Threshold\u2013Lexicographic Model\n\nStep 1. Epistemic Adequacy Threshold  \nA belief is permitted (in the combined sense) only if its epistemic support meets or exceeds a context-sensitive threshold T. T is not fixed by practical payoffs, though it may shift with conversational context, stakes for action, and salience of competing hypotheses. Crucially, T is satisfied or not; epistemic considerations determine entry to the domain of options.\n\nStep 2. Practical Selection Among Permissibles  \nWhen several propositions surpass T, practical reasons determine which of them one ought to believe. Practical considerations break ties, rank, or veto items already deemed truth-respecting enough. If exactly one candidate passes T, practical reasons are idle (though they may still make the belief easier or harder to sustain psychologically).\n\nStructural Priority Without Absolutism  \nLexicographic ordering gives unconditional priority to passing the epistemic gate. Yet practical import is not relegated to \u201cmere permissibility\u201d; it can be decisive whenever epistemic reasons fail to discriminate uniquely. Nothing requires a common scale; each reason-type exercises authority in its own normative register.\n\n5. Illustrative Cases\n\n5.1 The Paternalistic Doctor  \nDr. Patel knows that strictly speaking the evidence for recovery is 55%. T in medical contexts might be 0.8 given the risk of self-deception. Because 0.55 < T, the doctor may not claim \u201cYou will definitely recover\u201d to herself, however beneficial the optimistic belief would be for patient morale. Practical benefits cannot override sub-threshold evidence.\n\n5.2 The Placebo Athlete  \nSprinter Zoe has two epistemically open possibilities about her upcoming race: \u201cI will run sub-11 s\u201d (probability 0.4) and \u201cI will not\u201d (probability 0.6). Suppose T for casual personal forecasts is 0.3. Both beliefs are epistemically permissible. Given robust evidence that optimistic belief improves performance, Zoe has all-things-considered reason to adopt the confident belief. Practical reasons tip the balance only inside the permissibility window carved out by epistemic norms.\n\n5.3 Pascal\u2019s Wager Revisited  \nOn the wager, epistemic probability of God\u2019s existence may be low, but the infinite payoff looms large. The evidential probability arguably falls below T for metaphysical commitments. Thus, on the present model, even infinite expected value cannot compel belief if the epistemic gate is not cleared. Pascal might permissibly hope, strive to inquire, or adopt agnosticism, but not believe, all things considered.\n\n5.4 Exoneration Jury  \nA juror faced with evidence that gives 0.95 credence to guilt meets a legal threshold (\u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d) but notes that the moral stakes (risk of punishing the innocent) counsel extreme caution. Our model says T is fixed by the legal\u2013epistemic norm \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt,\u201d which 0.95 satisfies; yet because only one proposition (\u201cguilty\u201d) clears T, practical reasons cannot overturn it. The moral cost is folded into how high T was set in the first place, not into a post-threshold override.\n\n6. Why Threshold and Not Simple Lexical Priority?\n\nOne might think truth should enjoy outright lexical supremacy: believe p only if p is epistemically best supported, full stop. But that view has two problems.\n\n   a. Indeterminacy. Evidence often leaves several propositions equally best-supported. Strict lexical supremacy then yields multiple \u201cbest\u201d beliefs, paralyzing agency unless another normative dimension adjudicates.\n\n   b. Subordination of epistemic aims to human agency. A complete practical creature must sometimes harness belief as a tool (e.g. self-efficacy beliefs) while still respecting truth. Thresholds codify minimal respect without fetishizing maximal evidence, thereby integrating belief into life rather than isolating it in the ivory tower.\n\n7. Metaphysical Foundations: Why This Ordering Is Not Ad Hoc\n\n7.1 The Aim of Belief  \nMany writers (Williams, Velleman, Shah) hold that belief constitutively aims at truth. On such teleology, epistemic reasons enjoy structural\u2014not merely pragmatic\u2014priority: one does not count as believing at all unless one\u2019s attitude is regulated by truth considerations. That supplies the \u201cfirst-position\u201d in the lexicographic order.\n\n7.2 Autonomous Value of Truth  \nTruth\u2019s non-instrumental value explains why failing the threshold is decisive. There is no \u201csecond-best\u201d in believing falsehood for gain; that would betray the very standard that makes the attitude what it is.\n\n7.3 Practical Agency Condition  \nHuman agents also stand under reasons to promote value and avoid harm. Because belief influences action and emotion, it is intelligible that practical reasons have a normative foothold once epistemic integrity is secured. The threshold model lets each normative domain govern the aspect of belief closest to its telos.\n\n8. Dialectical Engagement\n\nObjection 1: Moral catastrophes justify believing against evidence\u2014e.g. believing \u201cmy child is alive\u201d to preserve sanity.\n\nReply. Our model allows that some contexts lower T (e.g. from 0.8 to 0.4) because the cost of error is low relative to inquiry costs, or because the domain (personal reassurance) is tolerant of some error. But if evidence remains below even the relaxed T, the agent may permissibly hope, imagine, or \u201caccept for the sake of coping,\u201d yet not believe. The model predicts why we find such self-deception understandable but still epistemically criticisable.\n\nObjection 2: Thresholds smuggle in practical considerations through the back door; T varies with stakes, so practical reasons are still commensurated with epistemic ones.\n\nReply. The dependence is functional, not scalar. Stakes help determine how much error a conversation or activity can tolerate (e.g. check vs. satellite-repair contexts establish different T\u2019s). This is akin to safety factors in engineering: practical facts fix the standard you must meet, but they do not themselves count as reasons to disregard the standard. Once T is set, practical reasons are excluded from overriding truth inside that context.\n\nObjection 3: Doxastic involuntarism renders Stage 2 moot; one cannot choose among threshold-clearing propositions.\n\nReply. Even if full-blown belief is not directly voluntary, we influence its formation by attending selectively, seeking or avoiding evidence, and calibrating confidence. These belief-forming policies are voluntary enough for practical reasons to bear. Our model thus speaks to policies or \u201cacceptances\u201d that guide eventual belief fixation, not merely to instantaneous acts of will.\n\nObjection 4: Pragmatic encroachment literature shows that practical stakes feed into the very amount of evidence needed, not merely into thresholds.\n\nReply. Agreed; that is a virtue, not a problem, for the threshold approach. High stakes raise T; low stakes lower T. What the model denies is that, after fixing T, practical reasons can swamp sub-threshold epistemic defeats. Encroachment is acknowledged, but it is channelled through the threshold mechanism, preserving the structural priority of epistemic adequacy.\n\n9. Precision in Distinctions\n\nBelief vs. Acceptance: We must distinguish believing p (aimed at truth) from accepting p for action (Cohen). The athlete may accept \u201cI will win\u201d while her outright belief hovers below certainty. Threshold failure may allow acceptance but not belief.\n\nPermissibility vs. Obligation: Passing T yields epistemic permissibility, not obligation. Practical reasons convert some permissible beliefs into obligatory ones.\n\nOverriding vs. Undermining: Practical reasons do not undermine epistemic force; they override only after adequacy is met, analogously to lexicographic decision rules in ethics.\n\n10. Substantive Contribution\n\nThe novelty lies in articulating a two-stage aggregator that:\n   \u2022 Respects constitutive truth-aiming without rendering belief useless as a practical tool.\n   \u2022 Explains why some pragmatic arguments (placebos) persuade while others (Pascal) do not.\n   \u2022 Provides a framework for integrating pragmatic encroachment without collapsing epistemic autonomy.\n   \u2022 Avoids cardinal commensuration, thereby side-stepping classical concerns about value pluralism.\n\n11. Relation to Existing Views\n\nAgainst Cliffordian evidentialism: We permit practical influence once epistemic standards are met, thereby capturing Jamesian insights about \u201cforced, momentous\u201d choices without licensing Clifford\u2019s nightmares of credulous believers.\n\nAgainst pure pragmatism: We retain an inviolable epistemic floor, blocking wishful thinking dressed up as moral urgency.\n\nCompared with recent \u201cstrong pragmatic encroachment\u201d (Fantl & McGrath), the threshold model is quieter: stakes affect knowledge thresholds but do not directly supply reasons to believe once error probabilities are fixed.\n\n12. Future Research Directions\n\n   \u2022 Empirical calibration: How do real agents implicitly set T across domains? Cognitive science could test whether confidence thresholds track error costs as predicted.\n   \u2022 Graded belief: Extend the model from full beliefs to credences, developing a two-stage aggregator for probability assignments under epistemic and practical pressure.\n   \u2022 Group epistemology: How should collectives with diverse value priorities set a shared T? Could democratic procedures integrate heterogeneous practical stakes?\n\n13. Conclusion\n\nEpistemic and practical reasons can jointly determine what one ought to believe without being weighed on a common scale. The key is recognizing two normative stages. First, epistemic reasons alone decide whether a proposition is even eligible by meeting a context-sensitive adequacy threshold. Second, within that eligible set, practical reasons legitimately adjudicate among options, sometimes uniquely determining the obligatory belief, sometimes leaving a range of permissible choices. This threshold-lexicographic model secures truth\u2019s structural priority while acknowledging belief\u2019s practical role in human life, thereby vindicating our intuitions in cases from placebos to Pascal and resolving the specter of incommensurability.", "output_tokens": 3600, "reasoning_tokens": 704}

We have:\n\n\u2022\u2002Epistemic reasons: considerations that bear on the truth of a proposition (evidence, explanatory power, probabilistic support).\n\n\u2022\u2002Practical reasons: considerations bearing on value or welfare (moral benefit, psychological health, instrumental payoff).\n\nIntuitively both kinds of reasons can matter.  A doctor faced with a terminally ill but hopeful patient may have excellent epistemic grounds for believing the prognosis is grim, yet also powerful moral reasons to believe\u2014or at least to sustain\u2014the more hopeful proposition, if that belief will measurably improve the patient\u2019s last months.  How, though, could she \u201cweigh\u201d radically different values that do not share a common metric?  If belief aims at truth, introducing moral or prudential weights seems like a category mistake; but if belief is also a tool for agency, ignoring practical considerations looks ethically obtuse.  The dialectic tends to polarise: purists deny the relevance of practical reasons to belief, pragmatists collapse epistemic reasons into the broader space of practical value, and encroachers treat the two as scalar components in an expected-utility calculation.  None of these responses is fully satisfactory.\n\nI.  Thesis\n\nI shall argue that the puzzle arises from a hidden assumption: that to decide what one ought to believe we must aggregate all reasons onto a single commensurable scale.  That assumption is optional.  A more fruitful approach recognises that (i) belief is a multifunctional state with distinct success conditions; (ii) the normative landscape is therefore vector-valued, not scalar; and (iii) higher-order procedural norms, rather than brute comparison of weights, determine how the vectors interact.  Concretely:\n\n1.\u2002Epistemic reasons are lexically but defeasibly prior: they set a baseline of permissible belief.\n\n2.\u2002Practical reasons function chiefly as permissions or prohibitions that operate only when epistemic reasons tie, underdetermine, or when overriding moral catastrophe looms.\n\n3.\u2002The relevant \u201cinteraction\u201d is not commensurative balancing but a two-stage governance procedure backed by higher-order reasons to treat truth-orientation as the default telos of doxastic agency.\n\nThis hierarchical pluralism reconciles the two kinds of reasons without pretending they measure the same quantity, and it explains the data\u2014Jamesian cases of moral urgency, contemporary results on pragmatic encroachment, and everyday phenomena like placebo belief\u2014better than either purism or wholesale pragmatism.\n\nII.  Why the Standard Options Fail\n\n1.  Purism (Owens, Kelly, Shah).  Purists hold that one simply ought to believe what the evidence supports; practical considerations are \u201creasons for action\u201d (e.g., to manipulate evidence or avoid inquiry) but never reasons for belief as such.  The view secures the teleology of belief but struggles with morally heroic cases.  Suppose, to adapt James, that an under-resourced rescue team will persevere only if they sincerely believe survivors remain alive.  The stakes are lives, not the rescuers\u2019 comfort.  If the evidence for survival is meagre, purism implies that their moral reasons are irrelevant to what they ought to believe.  Many find that verdict too austere: it asks agents to treat their cognitive life as hermetically sealed from morally decisive stakes.\n\n2.  Wholesale Pragmatism (Peirce\u2019s early \u201cfixation of belief,\u201d certain readings of R. Rorty).  Here any consideration that counts toward value counts as a reason for belief.  The problem is the reverse: truth becomes just another instrumental good.  The view predicts that if the expected utility of holding a false but comforting belief outweighs the disutility, rationality requires believing the falsehood\u2014an invitation to epistemic corruption and, ultimately, self-defeat, since reliable agency depends on true beliefs.\n\n3.  Simple Balancing Models (pragmatic encroachment in its cruder forms).  Some propose to multiply truth probability by practical stakes and pick the belief that maximises expected utility.  Yet the underlying units do not match: \u201c0.8 likelihood of truth\u201d and \u201c$10,000 benefit\u201d are not cardinal magnitudes of a single kind.  Attempts at utility-truth conversion either collapse into pragmatism or sneak in epistemic side-constraints that re-introduce purism by the back door.\n\nWe need an alternative that honours both domains without forced commensuration.\n\nIII.  A Functional Analysis of Belief\n\nBegin with a metaphysics of belief.  Beliefs serve two separable functions:\n\nF1: Cognitive mapping\u2014representing the world accurately (the \u201cmind-to-world\u201d direction of fit).\n\nF2: Agency facilitation\u2014coordinating perception, inference, and action toward valued ends (the \u201cworld-to-mind\u201d facilitative role).\n\nBecause one state handles both, its normativity is multiply realised.  Truth is the constitutive aim of F1; usefulness tracks F2.  Crucially, the two functions can sometimes pull apart, as in placebo or faith cases.  Recognising the dual functionality makes it unsurprising that two types of reasons bear on belief.  The task is to structure their interaction while respecting their heterogeneity.\n\nIV.  Normative Pluralism Without Scalar Reduction\n\nThink of reasons as forming a vector \u3008E, P\u3009 where E is a set of epistemic force-markers (e.g., likelihood ratios, explanatory coherence) and P is a set of practical valences (moral value, welfare, prudential cost).  Aggregating these into a single real number is neither possible nor necessary.  Decision theory already has multi-objective tools\u2014lexicographic ordering, Pareto frontiers, satisficing thresholds\u2014that avoid forced commensuration.  I propose a lexically ordered model:\n\nStage 1 (Epistemic filter): A belief is permissible only if it crosses a minimal evidential threshold appropriate to the context.  The threshold itself is sensitive to practical stakes, but the reasons doing the work here are epistemic (higher required likelihood when error costs are high, as Grimm and Fantl-McGrath argue).  Call the set of beliefs that pass this filter E-Permissible.\n\nStage 2 (Practical selector): Within E-Permissible, practical reasons can recommend, require, or forbid particular beliefs.  They never license a belief that fails stage 1 but can decisively break epistemic ties or underdetermination.\n\nStage 3 (Higher-order override): In extremely rare cases of moral catastrophe\u2014where believing against weighty evidence is the only route to prevent grave harm\u2014practical reasons can supply second-order reasons to treat a false belief as if it were epistemically permissible.  This is not commensuration; it is a change in the rule of belief governance itself, justified by higher-order moral reasons.  (Compare Rawls\u2019s lexical priority of basic liberties over utility.)\n\nV.  Illuminating Examples\n\nExample 1:  The Placebo Physician.  \nEvidence strongly indicates that a sugar pill will not physiologically reduce the patient\u2019s pain, but abundant RCT data show placebo effects are mediated by patient and physician belief.  The doctor herself faces the question: ought she believe the placebo will help?  Stage 1 blocks such belief\u2014the evidence is overwhelmingly that the pill lacks pharmacological efficacy.  But there is a nearby belief that passes stage 1 (\u201cBelieving helps\u201d), which suffices for therapeutic sincerity.  Stage 2 then supplies a moral reason to adopt that permissible belief enthusiastically rather than sceptically.  The framework explains how practical reasons influence belief while respecting evidential constraints.\n\nExample 2:  Rescue Faith.  \nThe search-and-rescue team\u2019s evidence is ambiguous: faint signals, uncertain sensor readings.  They are in the epistemic \u201cgrey region.\u201d  Stage 1 therefore delivers permissibility to believe either that survivors remain or do not.  Stage 2 lets moral reasons (lives at stake vs fatigue) adjudicate, obligating the hopeful belief and energising the mission.  No incommensurative calculus is needed because epistemic reasons do not dictate a single answer.\n\nExample 3:  Catastrophic Override (the Hawkings Asteroid).  \nImagine an astronomer concludes with 99.9 % confidence that an asteroid will strike, annihilating humanity.  Announcing that conclusion would cause global panic, sabotaging the only feasible deflection plan that relies on social stability.  Here third-stage higher-order reasons might justify withholding belief from the public and even encouraging the astronomer herself to cultivate some degree of hopeful disbelief.  Such cases are vanishingly rare, but they show why the model builds an escape clause.\n\nVI.  Why Not Treat Practical Reasons as Reasons for Action Only?\n\nA common purist reply is control: \u201cWe cannot choose belief directly; therefore practical reasons cannot address belief.\u201d  Two answers.\n\nFirst, indirect control suffices.  We manipulate evidence exposure, social environment, attention\u2014classic doxastic management.  Practical reasons easily bear on those controllable precursors, and rationality often evaluates agents along the complete deliberative path (analogous to evaluations of impulsive anger though we cannot press a button to be angry).\n\nSecond, even where control is minimal, reasons can apply to non-voluntary states.  We say one \u201cought not\u201d to be jealous or racist.  The norm expresses an ideal of agency, functioning to guide self-shaping practices and social expectations, not to issue immediate volitional commands.  So the control objection fails to block practical reasons from the doxastic landscape.\n\nVII.  Objections and Replies\n\nObjection 1:  \u201cLexical priority sneaks in purism\u2014practical reasons never defeat epistemic ones.\u201d  \nReply:  They can defeat them at stage 3, but only via second-order justification.  That is exactly what we should expect: morally extraordinary circumstances justify extraordinary governance rules.  Everyday cases still allow practical input within the evidentially permissible set.  The view is neither purist nor pragmatist but genuinely pluralist.\n\nObjection 2:  \u201cIf the framework is two-stage, beliefs in the permissible zone become arbitrary.\u201d  \nReply:  Practical reasons supply further structure, and in their absence epistemic reasons re-enter to recommend suspension or proportionate credence.  Ties are rarely perfect; residual evidence gradients remain.  Permissibility is not randomness.\n\nObjection 3:  \u201cYour model predicts pragmatic encroachment in knowledge: stakes affect evidential thresholds.\u201d  \nReply:  Correct.  Stage 1 allows practical stakes to modulate the sufficiency condition for knowledge-level justification, aligning with empirical intuitions (high-stakes bank case).  But it does so by adjusting the standard, not by balancing units.  Thus it avoids the charge of incommensurable weighing.\n\nObjection 4:  \u201cCultivating false beliefs, even for good ends, corrodes epistemic integrity.\u201d  \nReply:  The higher-order override is explicitly rare because the cost to integrity is itself a powerful practical negative.  Only catastrophic scenarios justify it.  Most everyday trade-offs occur within E-Permissible, preserving the mind\u2019s truth orientation.\n\nVIII.  Comparative Advantages\n\n1.\u2002Explains the motivational force of truth: truth-tracking is the default telos, not just an optional value.\n\n2.\u2002Grants genuine normative role to practical considerations without category error.\n\n3.\u2002Predicts specific phenomena:  \n\u2003(a) Pragmatic encroachment on knowledge standards.  \n\u2003(b) Placebo effects and \u201cepistemic paternalism.\u201d  \n\u2003(c) Epistemic dilemmas where suspension is the rational response because neither domain delivers decisive reasons.\n\n4.\u2002Avoids epistemic relativism: because practical override is rule-based and rare, the framework does not imply that any belief can be justified by any benefit.\n\nIX.  Toward a Broader Research Program\n\nThe hierarchical pluralist model suggests new questions:\n\nA.\u2002How exactly should context-sensitive evidential thresholds be calibrated?  Bayesian decision theory with loss functions gives one template, but richer moral factors complicate the formalism.\n\nB.\u2002What psychological mechanisms enable stage-2 selection without self-deception?  The distinction between \u201cbelief\u201d and \u201cacceptance\u201d (Cohen, Bratman) may allow agents to accept a proposition for practical purposes while bracketing full belief, preserving integrity.\n\nC.\u2002Can group agents\u2014committees, states\u2014implement the same two-stage procedure, or does collective belief require a single currency of reasons?  This touches political epistemology and the ethics of public communication.\n\nThese questions indicate that treating normative space as vector-valued rather than scalar is not merely a stopgap but a productive paradigm shift.\n\nX.  Conclusion\n\nThe apparent incommensurability of epistemic and practical reasons arises only if we insist on scalar aggregation.  By acknowledging belief\u2019s dual functionality, we obtain a vector-valued normative architecture governed by procedural rules: evidential permissibility first, value-based selection second, with a guarded portal for moral catastrophe.  This hierarchical pluralism is faithful to our best intuitions about truth\u2019s primacy, the moral significance of doxastic states, and the messy realities of cognitive agency.  It dissolves the conflict not by denying difference but by giving each kind of reason its proper place in a structured, multi-level account of what we\u2014finite, value-laden, yet truth-seeking creatures\u2014ought to believe.", "output_tokens": 3875, "reasoning_tokens": 960}

The key is to recognize that they do different kinds of normative work, operating at two distinct levels in the governance of belief.  Epistemic reasons directly evaluate candidate propositions for truth-likeness; practical reasons, by contrast, regulate higher-order parameters of belief-formation\u2014most importantly the confidence thresholds at which it is rational to shift from withholding judgment to full belief.  Once these roles are distinguished, an elegant picture emerges:  \n\n1. Epistemic reasons enjoy lexical priority at the first level, sorting propositions into three epistemic categories\u2014mandatory belief, mandatory disbelief, and epistemically-permissible suspension.  \n2. Practical reasons get their say only inside the zone of epistemic permissibility, where they help fix the precise thresholds and tie-break among epistemically on-a-par options.  \n\nBecause the two kinds of reasons address orthogonal questions\u2014truth of p vs. wisdom of adopting a given doxastic policy\u2014the worry about \u201cweighing\u201d incommensurables dissolves.  Interaction occurs, but by parameter-shaping rather than by simple addition.  I call this model Threshold-Lexical Integration (TLI).  Below I develop the view, contrast it with rivals, answer objections, and show its explanatory pay-off in concrete cases.  Approximate length: 2,100 words.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n1.  Setting the Problem\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nBegin with a familiar tension.  Cliffordian purists (\u201cIt is wrong always, everywhere, and for anyone, to believe anything upon insufficient evidence\u201d) take epistemic reasons to exhaust the normative landscape governing belief.  Jamesians and contemporary pragmatists, however, point to cases where believing beyond the evidence is salutary or even morally required: the faith-cure patient, the oppressed community that needs hope, the doctor who believes a placebo will work better if she herself is convinced.  If practical considerations can sometimes license belief, they appear to conflict with epistemic reasons.  Yet the two \u201ccurrencies\u201d seem incommensurable: truth-conduciveness is not obviously the sort of thing one trades off against utility or moral value.\n\nAttempts at direct balancing founder.  Should we assign \u201cutils\u201d to being correct and compare them to the utils of a saved life?  Any finite exchange-rate threatens absurdities (\u201cOne million true trivialities outweigh a life-saving but slightly under-evidenced belief\u201d).  On the other hand, declaring the currencies incomparable threatens stalemate: if practical reasons cannot even enter the deliberative arena, James\u2019s examples lose their force.  We need a structure that lets both speak without asking them to speak the same language.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n2.  A Crucial Distinction: First-Order vs. Higher-Order Doxastic Decisions\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nThe first step is a map of the decision points involved in coming to believe.\n\nFirst-order question (content-level): Is p true?  Answered by epistemic reasons\u2014e.g., likelihood ratios, explanatory coherence, track records of the sources.\n\nHigher-order question (policy-level): Given my current credence in p, should I move from suspension to outright belief (or disbelief)?  That requires setting thresholds: what level of confidence (0.9? 0.95? 0.7?) should tip me into the categorical state we call \u201cbelief\u201d?\n\nSetting thresholds is not itself a matter of evidence.  Nothing in the data forces us to adopt 0.9 rather than 0.8 as the belief point; scientists and courts use different cut-offs (\u201cpreponderance of evidence\u201d vs. \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d) precisely because downstream stakes differ.  Choosing a threshold is therefore evaluative in a way that looking at the likelihoods is not.  It implicates the costs of error and the benefits of being right\u2014 paradigmatically practical considerations.\n\nOnce we notice the two levels, the prospect of a division of normative labour appears: epistemic reasons govern how high the credence ladder a proposition climbs; practical reasons, how high the ladder must be before we step off onto the plateau of belief.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n3.  The Threshold-Lexical Integration Model\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nFormal Sketch  \n\nLet C(p|E) be one\u2019s credence in p given total evidence E.  Fix two thresholds:\n\n   t_b   \u2013 level at which one must believe p  \n   t_d   \u2013 level below which one must disbelieve p  \n\nFor simplicity assume symmetry (t_b = 1 \u2013 t_d), though this is not essential.\n\nStage 1 (Epistemic Screening)  \nIf C \u2265 t_b* (where t_b* is the highest admissible threshold given purely epistemic considerations) then epistemic reasons make believing p mandatory; if C \u2264 t_d* they make disbelief mandatory.  Outside these extremes\u2014the \u201cgray zone\u201d\u2014epistemic reasons declare no unique verdict.  Suspension is permissible; so may be belief, but not required.\n\nStage 2 (Practical Parameter-Setting)  \nWithin the gray zone, one consults practical reasons to choose among the epistemically allowed options.  Technically, practical reasons select t_b and t_d (or choose belief/suspension directly) subject to the constraint that they cannot overturn an epistemic mandatory verdict.  Epistemic reasons are lexically prior\u2014like rights that cannot be violated for aggregate good\u2014but they leave space in which practical reasons are decisive.\n\nTwo salutary consequences follow.\n\nA. No Direct Trade-Off.  We never weigh one unit of truth against x units of hospital beds saved.  Truth has lexical dominance whenever the evidence is decisive; only where epistemic reasons run out of steam do practical reasons get a grip.\n\nB. Context-Sensitivity without Wishful Thinking.  Doctors facing life-or-death decisions may set a lower belief threshold for promising hypotheses, whereas mathematicians can insist on proof.  Yet nobody may \u201cbelieve the bridge is safe\u201d when the evidential probability is 0.1, no matter how urgent the crossing\u2014that would flout Stage-1 strictures.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n4.  How the View Differs from Competitors\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n4.1 Pure Pragmatic Encroachment  \n\nOn pragmatic encroachment (Stanley, Fantl & McGrath), practical stakes feed directly into whether one *knows* or is justified in believing p.  TLI agrees that stakes matter but demotes them to parameter level; the evidential threshold itself is adjusted, not the assessment of evidence.  The result avoids a worry that encroachment collapses into wishful thinking: evidence determines likelihood, full stop; only the acceptability of acting on that likelihood varies.\n\n4.2 Two-Level Reliabilism  \n\nJonathan Adler and Hilary Kornblith claim that practical reasons influence \u201cacceptance\u201d but not \u201cbelief.\u201d  TLI keeps a single psychological state of belief yet explains its dual governance.  It thereby captures data about felt doxastic tension when we raise the stakes: lottery propositions are believed enough to bet on a $1 ticket but not enough to testify in court.  What changes is the threshold, not the attitude-kind.\n\n4.3 \u201cPragmatic Reasons Are Not Reasons for Belief\u201d (Kelly, Shah)  \n\nThese purists object that practical considerations might be reasons to *bring it about* that one believes (instrumentally) but not reasons that count in favor of the belief\u2019s truth.  TLI grants the asymmetry but insists that higher-order policy selection is part of the normative landscape of doxastic life.  Shortcut: practical reasons are not truth-indicative, but they are belief-permissive.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n5.  Three Test Cases\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n(1) Placebo Paternalism  \nDr. Hope knows the evidence that Drug X outperforms placebo is mediocre (credence 0.6).  She also knows that if she herself believes fervently in X, her confident bedside manner will nudge patient adherence and yield significant clinical benefit.  \n\nStage-1: C=0.6 < t_b* (say, 0.85); belief not epistemically mandatory.  \nStage-2: The expected welfare gain makes lowering the threshold to 0.55 rationally permissible.  So Hope may believe X, but only because she is still above the adjusted threshold.  Were her credence 0.3, no amount of benefit could justify belief.\n\n(2) Climate Scientist vs. Podcast Dilettante  \nThe scientist\u2019s evidence places anthropogenic warming at 0.97 probability: well above t_b*.  No practical cost\u2014economic, political, or personal\u2014can cancel the epistemic mandate; disbelieving would be irrational regardless of lobbying pressure.  The podcast host, with vastly poorer evidence, sits at credence 0.55.  Epistemically permissible to suspend; if the host is advising public policy under huge downside risk, practical reasons dictate believing pending further study.\n\n(3) Beyond Reasonable Doubt  \nCourtrooms explicitly encode differential thresholds: civil trials (preponderance, >0.5), criminal trials (~0.9), capital cases (higher still).  Juries evaluate evidence (Stage-1) and then apply a legally fixed threshold (Stage-2), itself justified by practical considerations about wrongful conviction vs. acquittal.  TLI explains why we do not find this schizophrenic: the truth of guilt is one matter; the wisdom of convicting given uncertainty is another.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n6.  Addressing Four Objections\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nObjection 1: The Transparently Aim of Belief  \nNishi Shah argues that deliberating about whether to believe necessarily involves the question \u201cIs p true?\u201d  Practical considerations thus cannot be reasons *for belief*.  Reply: TLI concedes direct reasons for p\u2019s truth are evidential; practical reasons are reasons to adopt a belief-policy with certain error tolerances.  Deliberation can accommodate both by nesting: \u201cIs p true enough, given what hangs on it?\u201d  The transparency of belief aims at truth, but the transparency of adopting a *belief threshold* aims at good overall outcomes.\n\nObjection 2: Doxastic Voluntarism and Feasibility  \nCan we really choose thresholds at will?  Empirical evidence on confidence calibration (signal-detection theory) shows that humans flexibly adjust criteria under reward manipulations.  What feels impossible\u2014believing at 0.2 probability\u2014is not demanded; only modulating the pass-fail line, something agents demonstrably do, is required.  So TLI respects psychological realism.\n\nObjection 3: Slippery Slope to Wishful Thinking  \nIf saving a single life lets me drop t_b from 0.9 to 0.6, why not to 0.1 if a million lives are on the line?  TLI blocks the slide via lexical priority: below some evidence floor there is no trade; the proposition falls into the \u201cepistemically forbidden\u201d region.  That floor is set by purely epistemic constraints like coherence and base-rate plausibility.  The door to wishful thinking remains locked.\n\nObjection 4: Incommensurability Persists Inside the Gray Zone  \nEven if interaction is confined to a permissive zone, how do we compare \u201cslightly more confidence\u201d with \u201cslightly more utility\u201d?  The answer is decision-theoretic: choose the threshold that maximizes expected utility where the utility function already has separate terms for accuracy (negative loss for error) and practical value.  Nothing prevents a multi-attribute utility function; what TLI forbids is overriding constraints, not quantitative aggregation once inside them.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n7.  Philosophical Pay-Off\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n7.1 Unifying Epistemic and Practical Normativity  \nTLI shows that what looked like a clash stems from conflating two questions.  Once separated, normativity is **layered** rather than **mixed**: truth matters first; welfare matters next; there is no single scale because there is no single decision point.\n\n7.2 Explaining Phenomenological Data  \nWhy does a mathematician confronted with P \u2248 0.9 still suspend, while a pilot will act on P = 0.7?  Because their acceptable thresholds differ, not their respect for evidence.  Why do we feel angrier at someone who believed on thin evidence and thereby caused harm than at someone who guessed luckily and did no damage?  Because practical stakes rightly figure in Stage-2 responsibility attributions.\n\n7.3 Connections to Epistemic Injustice  \nMarginalized speakers often need stronger evidence to be believed.  On TLI this is a distortion of thresholds, politically rather than epistemically motivated.  The framework helps pinpoint the injustice: it operates at the practical-policy layer, not by impugning evidence.\n\n7.4 Research Program  \nQuantitative work can explore optimal threshold-setting under different accuracy-loss functions, bridging formal epistemology and moral philosophy.  Empirical psychology can investigate whether humans actually track a floor of epistemic permissibility; experimental philosophy can probe how laypeople allocate blame across the two stages.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n8.  Conclusion\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nThe apparent incommensurability of epistemic and practical reasons is a mirage borne of a flattened normative picture.  Belief-formation is governed by a two-level system.  Epistemic reasons rule on truth; practical reasons rule on the policy of treating a proposition as settled, but only when the epistemic court has declared the case non-decisive.  Threshold-Lexical Integration thus secures the Jamesian insight that stakes sometimes matter without sacrificing the Cliffordian conviction that evidence commands respect.  Interaction occurs, yet nothing needs to be weighed on a single scale; instead, different currencies purchase different goods at different stalls of the marketplace of reasons.", "output_tokens": 3735, "reasoning_tokens": 832}

The Puzzle  \n\nWe ordinarily navigate two strikingly different kinds of considerations about belief.  \n(1) Epistemic reasons: the meteorological data indicate a 90 % chance of rain.  \n(2) Practical reasons: carrying an umbrella is awkward, but arriving soaked at a job interview would be disastrous.  \n\nIn most cases we treat (1) as bearing on whether to believe it will rain and (2) as bearing on whether to pack an umbrella. Yet in many real cases\u2014religious faith, courtroom deliberation, self-deception about a partner\u2019s fidelity\u2014practical and epistemic reasons appear to converge on the same doxastic question: to believe or not to believe p. Then the conflict between \u201ctruth-directed\u201d and \u201cvalue-directed\u201d considerations seems intractable. Each is compelling in its own currency; neither obviously translates into the other\u2019s terms. How, then, could there be one all-things-considered answer to the question \u201cWhat ought I believe?\u201d  \n\nI defend a two-tier model of doxastic normativity. Epistemic and practical reasons do not compete on a single scale attached directly to individual propositions. Rather, they are addressed to different loci of agency: epistemic reasons govern first-order belief-formation policies, while practical reasons govern a higher-order choice among those policies. An agent first decides, in light of her values and the situation\u2019s stakes, which epistemic policy (credence threshold, standard of proof, inferential style, etc.) she is licensed to deploy; that higher-order practical decision fixes the evidential bar at which belief is formed; and from that point on only epistemic reasons determine whether p should actually be believed. In short, practical reasons tell us *how carefully* to investigate and *how much evidence to demand*, while epistemic reasons, given that policy, tell us *what the evidence warrants*. Once the architecture is laid bare, the apparent incommensurability dissolves: epistemic and practical reasons are not commensurated directly; they operate at distinct but nested levels of agency.\n\nThe argument unfolds as follows. \u00a72 sharpens the distinction and the incommensurability worry. \u00a73 canvasses three prominent attempts at reconciliation and identifies their limits. \u00a74 develops the two-tier model in detail and shows how it secures interaction without illicit currency conversion. \u00a75 answers six pressing objections. \u00a76 sketches wider implications for pragmatic encroachment, epistemic permissivism, and the ethics of belief.  \n\n2. Why the Two Kinds of Reasons Seem Impossibly Unlike  \n\nCall a reason epistemic iff, roughly, its relevance to belief derives from its bearing on the truth of the believed proposition. Call a reason practical iff its relevance derives from some non-truth value\u2014moral, prudential, aesthetic, etc.\u2014that attaches to holding the belief. Three contrasts suggest that no common metric exists.\n\n(1) Direction of fit: epistemic reasons have mind-to-world direction of fit; practical reasons seem world-to-mind.  \n(2) Assessment standard: epistemic rationality is appraised by accuracy; practical rationality by utility.  \n(3) Voluntariness: practical reasons straightforwardly engage choice, while belief appears to be a largely involuntary response to evidence.\n\nIf those contrasts mark a genuine ontological gulf, an agent confronting strong evidence for p but disastrous consequences of mis-believing p faces an impossible calculation. Either she judges in defiance of evidence, sacrificing epistemic propriety, or she obeys evidence and risks disaster. A single \u201cought\u201d that somehow aggregates these two disparate considerations looks out of reach.\n\n3. Three Familiar Moves\u2014and Their Troubles  \n\n3.1 Truth-Monism (Pragmatism turned on its head)  \nJamesian pragmatists collapse the distinction by claiming that practical stakes affect the very probability calculus: high stakes enlarge the space of relevant error possibilities, so more evidence is required for knowledge. Contemporary pragmatic encroachment theories follow this path. Trouble: either the view surreptitiously reclassifies practical considerations as epistemic (by smuggling value into the probability base), or it erodes the concept of belief itself, forcing a stake-sensitive fluidity alien to ordinary usage.\n\n3.2 Dual-Ought Pluralism  \nOthers bite the bullet: there is an epistemic oughtE to believe p when the evidence supports p, and a practical oughtP not-to-believe-p when great harm would ensue. The appearance of conflict is a surface illusion; normativity is simply plural. Difficulty: agents still need guidance. The doctor deliberating about whether to disclose a grim prognosis cannot act on two incompatible oughts. Bifurcation postpones rather than resolves the practical impasse.\n\n3.3 Value Reduction  \nStill others fold epistemic reasons into the practical by claiming truth itself is a value, so epistemic reasons are just a subset of practical reasons with the special weight truth possesses in the utility function. Two objections: (i) epistemic normativity exhibits a distinctive deontic flavor (one *ought not* believe if the evidence does not support), whereas utility talk is characteristically permissive; (ii) intrinsic value of truth does not alone explain why minuscule truth gains often outweigh sizeable pragmatic benefits (consider trivial truths learned at great cost).\n\n4. A Two-Tier Model of Doxastic Normativity  \n\n4.1 The Basic Picture  \nHuman beings exercise doxastic agency at more than one grain size. There is the rapid, often unconscious updating of individual beliefs in response to stimuli, and there is the slower, reflective governance of our cognitive machinery\u2014choosing investigative methods, calibrating standards of proof, deciding how robust a peer-review filter to trust, whether to suspend judgment pending further inquiry, etc. Crucially, the latter is voluntary to a far greater degree than the former.\n\nTier-1: Policy Choice (higher-order, voluntary, evaluable by practical reasons)  \nTier-2: Belief Adoption given a Policy (lower-order, largely involuntary, evaluable by epistemic reasons)\n\n4.2 How the Tiers Interact  \nStep 1. Practical assessment of stakes fixes a *doxastic risk profile* (DRP) governing the domain. If the cost of error is catastrophic, the DRP sets a strict standard: adopt belief only on overwhelming evidence. If the cost is trivial, the DRP may permit belief on a lighter evidential basis.  \nStep 2. Within the chosen DRP, one applies epistemic norms\u2014Bayesian conditionalisation, explanatory coherence, statistical significance tests, peer disagreement protocols. Whether belief that p is *permitted* or *required* is now wholly a matter of evidential fit to the DRP-determined threshold.  \n\nBecause practical reasons operate one level up, they need never be directly weighed against particular pieces of evidence. They help select the normative environment within which evidence does its work.\n\n4.3 An Illuminating Example  \n\nThe Pharmacist Case. A pharmacist must decide whether a pill bottle contains digitoxin (which can be lethal) or an identical-looking placebo.  \nEvidential situation: 80 % probability of digitoxin given barcode records.  \nPractical stakes: if digitoxin is mis-labelled as placebo, a patient may die; if placebo is mis-labelled as digitoxin, the patient merely lacks a treatment.  \n\nPolicy selection: Because a false-negative is disastrous, the pharmacist\u2019s DRP dictates a *conservative* policy: believe \u201cdigitoxin\u201d only at 95 % confidence. On that policy, the 80 % evidence is insufficient; the pharmacist must suspend judgment and run a chemical assay.  \n\nNotice how practical and epistemic reasons interact without direct commensuration: the 95 % threshold emerges from practical assessment, but the subsequent suspension is purely epistemic\u2014it follows mechanically once the threshold is in place. Were the stakes different (say a mock pharmacy training exercise), the DRP might license belief on the very same evidence.\n\n4.4 Why This is Not Pragmatic Encroachment Redux  \nPragmatic encroachment claims that the probability of p required for knowledge varies with stakes; the present model claims that *the belief threshold* varies, not the probability required for knowledge. Knowledge remains a purely epistemic status; what changes is which policy the agent is rationally permitted to deploy. On our view, high-stakes cases alter inference policy, not the epistemic status of the evidence itself.\n\n4.5 Formal Sketch  \nLet S be an agent, P a set of doxastic policies {\u03c01,\u2026,\u03c0n}.  \nPractical reasons justify PR: S oughtP to adopt \u03c0k in context C.  \nEpistemic reasons then justify ER: S oughtE to believe p iff Evidence(p|C) \u2265 \u03c4(\u03c0k), where \u03c4(\u03c0k) is the evidential threshold in \u03c0k.  \nThe all-things-considered ought is the composite: S ought to believe p iff (i) S oughtP to adopt \u03c0k and (ii) Evidence(p) meets \u03c4(\u03c0k). Aggregation happens not among first-order reasons but sequentially across tiers.\n\n5. Objections and Replies  \n\nObjection 1: The model merely relocates the incommensurability\u2014practical reasons must now be weighed against each other to pick a policy, and some epistemic element may intrude there.  \nReply: True, policy choice is a deliberative act; but both inputs there are practical (truth\u2019s intrinsic and instrumental value is itself a practical good). No distinctively epistemic datum\u2014probability, explanatory power\u2014needs to be balanced against utility; hence we avoid mixing categories.\n\nObjection 2: The model predicts permissibility, not obligatoriness. Suppose two policies tie on overall practical value. Which should S adopt?  \nReply: Genuine ties yield under-determination; that is no vice. Where policy choice is permissibly open, both believing and withholding may be rationally permissible. Ordinary epistemic permissivism already countenances such cases.\n\nObjection 3: Beliefs are not under voluntary control, so talk of policy choice is neurophysiological fiction.  \nReply: Empirical psychology confirms metacognitive control mechanisms (attention allocation, inquiry suspension, confirmation-seeking vs falsification-seeking) that modulate belief thresholds. We may not choose *to* believe, but we do choose *how* we process inputs.\n\nObjection 4: What of cases where practical reasons appear to swamp evidence after the policy is set\u2014e.g., Pascal\u2019s Wager?  \nReply: The Wager is a policy-level argument. It recommends adopting a doxastic policy that privileges infinite expected utility over standard evidential thresholds. Critics rightly object that such a policy violates widely shared practical norms concerning cognitive integrity and autonomy. The dispute belongs at Tier-1.\n\nObjection 5: Tier-division collapses in scientific collaboration, where group policy (e.g., p<0.05) is fixed institutionally, yet individual high-stakes decisions must be made.  \nReply: The model generalises hierarchically: individual practical reasons may sometimes override default institutional policies by justifying personalised caution. The airline mechanic double-checks wing stability despite industry standards. That is precisely how practical reasons rightly intrude\u2014before, not during, evidential assessment.\n\nObjection 6: Doesn\u2019t the model trivialise epistemic reasons? They become mere servants of whatever policy practical stakes dictate.  \nReply: Not so. Epistemic reasons remain autonomous within the evidential space carved out by a policy; and since practical reasons cannot legitimately recommend policies that systematically flout truth (epistemic blameworthiness is itself a practical cost), there are substantial de facto constraints on what policies are viable. The partnership is reciprocal, not hierarchical domination.\n\n6. Broader Payoffs  \n\n6.1 Pragmatic Encroachment Tamed  \nWe explain stake-sensitivity of knowledge attributions without altering the semantics of \u201cknow\u201d: high stakes prompt sceptical policies that raise the evidential bar for justified belief, thereby making knowledge harder to obtain. Encroachment is an epiphenomenon of policy selection.\n\n6.2 Epistemic Permissivism Explained  \nIf multiple policies tie in practical value, evidence can diverge in its doxastic upshot across policies, legitimising epistemic permissiveness. The model thus integrates permissivism into the normativity of belief without deeming it arbitrary.\n\n6.3 Ethics of Belief Rehabilitated  \nCliffordian strictures (\u201cIt is always wrong, everywhere, for anyone, to believe on insufficient evidence\u201d) are best read as default policy recommendations\u2014not categorical first-order bans. We can vindicate Clifford\u2019s spirit while accommodating Jamesian latitude in special contexts (religious faith, romance, existential crises) where practical stakes arguably license laxer policies.\n\n6.4 Toward a Unified Theory of Normative Governance  \nThe two-tier structure mirrors familiar layers in action theory (intention-formation policies vs motor execution), bureaucratic law (constitutional rules vs ordinary statutes), and AI alignment (meta-policies over reward functions vs policy networks). Doxastic agency is not sui generis; its nested governance exemplifies a general design solution to multi-value rationality.\n\n7. Conclusion  \n\nThe apparent incommensurability of epistemic and practical reasons arises from a category mistake: we picture them as rival weights on a single scale attached directly to propositions. In fact they occupy different rungs in the ladder of cognitive control. Practical reasons license or withhold doxastic policies; epistemic reasons, given a licensed policy, settle what the evidence requires us to believe. By respecting that architectural division we allow the two kinds of reasons to interact coherently without forcing currency conversion. The result not only resolves the classical puzzle but illuminates a host of live debates\u2014from pragmatic encroachment and permissivism to the ethics of belief and the design of epistemic institutions.  \n\nTruth and value do not finally compete for possession of our minds; they collaborate, each at its proper level, in the ongoing governance of cognitive life.", "output_tokens": 3631, "reasoning_tokens": 640}

Epistemic reasons set the permissible boundaries of belief by tracking truth; practical reasons adjust where, within those boundaries, belief is obligatory, optional, or forbidden by raising or lowering the standard of epistemic justification that must be met.  Incommensurability is therefore not a barrier: the two kinds of reasons interact structurally rather than arithmetically, each exercising a distinct normative role.  Once we recognize this \u201cthreshold-gating\u201d model, apparent puzzles about how to \u201cbalance\u201d truth-conduciveness against welfare dissolve, and we gain principled explanations of hard cases ranging from James\u2019s \u201cWill to Believe\u201d to recent debates about moral encroachment on knowledge.\n\nI.  Setting up the puzzle\n\n1.  Epistemic reasons (ERs): considerations that bear on the truth of a proposition p\u2014evidence, explanatory coherence, reliability of sources, and so on.\n\n2.  Practical reasons (PRs): considerations that bear on the desirability of coming to believe p\u2014its moral consequences, instrumental utility, psychological benefits, or harms.\n\nWe are attracted to the thought that both can matter.  If a physician has only suggestive evidence that a drug is lethal, the moral stakes make it wrongful to believe that it is safe; if a depressed patient\u2019s recovery hinges on believing that life is worth living, the practical payoff seems relevant.  But ERs and PRs appear incommensurable.  ERs aim at truth; PRs aim at value.  What common currency could adjudicate a stand-off between \u201cprobability 0.6 that p is true\u201d and \u201csaving a life if p is believed\u201d?\n\nStandard responses polarize.  Evidentialists grant authority solely to ERs; pragmatists (from Pascal to James) allow PRs sometimes to override.  Hybrids try to assign numerical weights, but the assignment looks ad hoc and alien to ordinary epistemic practice.  I shall argue for a different kind of hybrid, one that dispenses with numerical commensuration and instead locates ERs and PRs at different stages of a single decision procedure.\n\nII.  The functionalist clue: what belief is for\n\nBelief is not just another mental attitude; its distinctive functional role is to settle a question so that the believer can rely on p as true in further reasoning.  That functional role explains why truth is its constitutive aim.  Yet the very point of forming beliefs is practical: we are agents who must act, and accurate beliefs are valuable chiefly because of their downstream effects on action and welfare.  So while the first-order standards that individuate belief are epistemic, the point of the whole doxastic enterprise is practical.  This dual nature motivates a dual-normativity picture:\n\nLayer 1 \u2013 Constitutive norm: Believe p only if p is (likely) true (epistemic).\n\nLayer 2 \u2013 Agency norm: Manage your doxastic economy so that it promotes your legitimate ends (practical).\n\nBut dual norms need not collide.  They can be assigned different deontic roles\u2014one fixing the range of permissible belief states, the other deciding which state within that range is required or forbidden.\n\nIII.  The threshold-gating model\n\nCall an epistemic threshold T the level of evidential support rationally required for outright belief.  Traditional epistemology implicitly treats T as fixed (say, a credence above .9, or knowledge-level justification).  The threshold-gating model lets PRs shift T upward or downward:\n\nRule 1 (Boundary): A proposition p may not be believed if the evidence falls below T (avoids wishful thinking).\n\nRule 2 (Gating): Practical stakes determine where T lies for the context at hand.  High moral or prudential stakes raise T; negligible stakes lower it.\n\nRule 3 (Determinacy): Within the permitted zone (evidence \u2265 T), whether belief is obligatory, optional, or disallowed is again governed by PRs.\n\nInteraction therefore requires no cardinal trade-off between ERs and PRs.  ERs supply a \u201ctruth index\u201d (evidence) that is unaffected by PRs; PRs operate by moving the pass/fail line and by adding further deontic force once the line is crossed.\n\nA helpful analogy is safety regulation.  Engineers assess the probability a bridge will collapse (epistemic).  Legislators decide how safe is safe enough (practical).  The two domains interact without measurement on a common scale: the evidential probability is what it is; political morality decides the acceptable threshold of risk.\n\nIV.  Illustrative cases\n\n1.  High-stakes medical belief  \nEvidence that Drug X is safe sits at .8.  Ordinarily .8 might suffice for belief.  But if believing and prescribing wrongly would kill patients, stakes raise T to .95.  Because evidence < T, the physician ought not believe X is safe.  There is no commensuration problem: we do not combine 0.8 and \u201cpossible deaths\u201d into a single number; we let \u201cpossible deaths\u201d move the line.\n\n2.  Jamesian religious conversion  \nSuppose S is confronted with a \u201cgenuine option\u201d to believe in God where evidence is indecisive (.5).  The benefit of belief is said to be eternal bliss; the cost of error, wasted piety.  PRs here do not raise the threshold, because the stakes pertain to action conditional on belief, not to the risk of harming others with error.  T therefore stays at the ordinary level (say, .7), below which belief remains merely permitted or prudentially encouraged.  If S can voluntarily attain belief, PRs may render it permissible, but epistemically it remains optional.  Again no direct weighing is needed.\n\n3.  Moral encroachment  \nRecent literature argues that the evidence needed for knowledge that a crime was committed by a minority suspect is higher than for a non-minority because of the moral cost of wrongful blame.  The threshold-gating model captures this elegantly: higher moral stakes about wrongful accusation raise T, explaining why \u201csame evidence, same belief\u201d can be false across contexts.\n\nV.  The deontic upshot\n\nThe model yields three doxastic statuses:\n\nRequired: Evidence \u2265 T and PRs positively favor belief (e.g., public-safety reasons to believe the bridge is unsafe when evidence meets the elevated threshold).\n\nPermitted: Evidence \u2265 T but PRs are neutral (ordinary low-stakes everyday beliefs).\n\nForbidden: Evidence < T (regardless of PRs).\n\nThere is thus no moment at which we must pile ERs and PRs onto a single scale.  PRs influence belief exclusively by setting T and by shifting the deontic verdict within the space ERs leave open.\n\nVI.  Advantages over rival views\n\n1.  Against pure evidentialism  \nThe physician case shows that belief can be forbidden even when evidential support is substantial.  Pure evidentialism cannot explain why the same evidence suffices on Tuesday but is inadequate on Wednesday when the stakes rise.\n\n2.  Against pragmatic override theories  \nBy denying that PRs can make belief obligatory when evidence is far below any respectable threshold, the model avoids the implausible licencing of wishful thinking (e.g., believing one will win the lottery to feel happy).  PRs may not coerce belief where truth-aim frustrations would be too severe.\n\n3.  Against numerical utilitarian aggregation  \nSince we never add utility to probability, we escape the accusation of arbitrariness familiar from expected-utility epistemology while preserving the intuition that stakes matter.\n\nVII.  Dialectical engagement\n\nObjection A:  Lexical priority of ERs is smuggled back in under a new label; PRs have only secondary significance.\n\nReply:  PRs exercise real authority\u2014they determine both the position of T and the deontic force beyond it.  That is enough to let high stakes veto beliefs that would otherwise be rational and to mandate beliefs urgent for moral action once the evidence is adequate.\n\nObjection B:  What about \u201ccostless\u201d moral demands that we believe truths about distant suffering?  Evidence may be slight, stakes low for us, yet many think belief is obligatory.\n\nReply:  The model accommodates this: practical reasons include moral duties to respect others; believing a victim\u2019s testimony can be morally required not because the stakes are personally high but because of duties of recognition.  Those same duties raise T only moderately (the cost of error is reputational harm to the accused, not death).  If the available evidence barely clears that moderate threshold, belief is required.  Again structure not commensuration explains the result.\n\nObjection C:  Doxastic involuntarism makes \u201cought to believe\u201d incoherent; we cannot choose belief and so cannot be guided by PRs.\n\nReply:  We need only the weaker claim that we can influence belief via indirect control\u2014seeking more evidence, exposing ourselves to arguments, avoiding self-serving bias.  PRs therefore shape the doxastic landscape by telling us which epistemic standards to adopt and which deliberative policies to pursue.\n\nVIII.  Precision in distinctions\n\n1.  Belief vs. acceptance  \nBelief is involuntary and truth-aimed; acceptance is a policy of acting as if p.  Many putative PR-based \u201cbeliefs\u201d (e.g., the pilot calming passengers) are really acceptances.  Recognizing the distinction prevents exaggerating PRs\u2019 reach.\n\n2.  Permissive zone vs. evidential slack  \nEven within a fixed T, evidence rarely pins a single credence.  The model distinguishes epistemically permissible slack from practical slack.  ERs permit alternative credences; PRs decide which credence one ought to settle on.\n\n3.  Stakes vs. costs  \nThe stakes that shift T are costs of error, not payoffs of truth.  This asymmetry explains why Pascal-style payoffs do not lower thresholds but safety-oriented costs raise them.\n\nIX.  Substantive contribution: reconciling moral encroachment and evidentialism\n\nThe threshold-gating model shows that \u201cmoral encroachment\u201d need not abandon the truth-aim of belief.  It reinterprets encroachment as the moral modulation of thresholds governing when evidence is good enough, thereby preserving the distinct roles of ERs and PRs.  This reframing dissolves the stalemate between traditionalists and encroachers by revealing that the disagreement is about the level of T, not about the kinds of reasons that count.\n\nX.  Extending the model\n\n1.  Formalization  \nLet e be the evidential probability of p, S the stake-sensitive cost of error measured in non-epistemic value units, and f(S) a monotone function mapping stakes onto threshold levels in [0,1].  Required for belief: e \u2265 f(S).  The function\u2019s shape is supplied by practical norms (e.g., regulatory policy).  No need exists to scale e and S together.\n\n2.  Multiple thresholds  \nComplex cases can distinguish believe, assert, and act.  Each has its own T determined by corresponding stakes (epistemic confidence can suffice for action but not assertion, or vice versa).\n\nXI.  Conclusion\n\nThe received impasse over incommensurable reasons rests on a mistaken image of balancing.  Epistemic and practical reasons do not compete on a single evidential-pragmatic balance beam; they occupy successive normative stages.  Epistemic reasons measure distance from truth; practical reasons set and interpret the benchmarks that determine whether that distance is close enough for the purposes that matter.  Their interaction is thus architectural, not arithmetic.  Once this structure is clear, we can preserve the constitutive connection between belief and truth while acknowledging the pervasive influence of moral and prudential stakes on what we ought\u2014simpliciter\u2014to believe.", "output_tokens": 3529, "reasoning_tokens": 960}

The Puzzle and the Plan\n\nWe appear to be pulled by two very different kinds of reasons when we ask what we ought to believe. On the one hand, there are epistemic reasons: considerations such as the weight and reliability of evidence or the explanatory power of a hypothesis\u2014things that speak in favor of a belief\u2019s being true. On the other hand, there are practical reasons: considerations about how holding (or failing to hold) the belief would affect our welfare, our moral standing, or the welfare of others. The puzzle is straightforward: epistemic and practical reasons look incommensurable. Epistemic reasons \u201cpoint toward truth,\u201d while practical reasons \u201cpoint toward value.\u201d How could pointers directed at seemingly orthogonal targets ever be placed on the same scale? And if they cannot be placed on the same scale, how could they jointly determine a single, all-things-considered verdict about what one ought to believe?\n\nMy thesis is that we need not\u2014indeed, should not\u2014try to place epistemic and practical reasons onto a single numerical scale in order for them to interact. Instead, they interact by being assessed in two distinct dimensions of normative evaluation that jointly constrain rational belief. The right model is not one of aggregation (in which reasons of different kinds are summed or balanced) but one of vector dominance (in which each belief is assessed along two axes, epistemic adequacy and practical adequacy). A belief is permissible only if it is undefeated in both dimensions\u2014roughly, if no alternative belief (or withholding) is strictly better epistemically without being worse practically, or strictly better practically without being worse epistemically. When the dimensions conflict, epistemic reasons normally silence practical ones; but in a limited range of high-stakes contexts practical reasons gain the power to \u201cdefeat\u201d epistemic permission, not by outweighing but by vetoing. This hybrid model\u2014call it the Two-Dimensional Norm (2-DN)\u2014allows interaction without illicit commensuration and captures both our evidential and our pragmatic intuitions.\n\nI develop the model in five steps. (i) I diagnose where the intuitive sense of incommensurability arises. (ii) I survey four extant strategies\u2014reductionism, pure evidentialism, lexical priority, and weighted aggregation\u2014and show why each fails. (iii) I articulate the 2-DN in more detail, drawing on ideas of Pareto dominance, permission, and defeat. (iv) I illustrate the view with three cases\u2014Pascalian religious faith, emergency medical triage, and \u201cnoble lies\u201d\u2014showing how the 2-DN generates plausible verdicts that competitors mishandle. (v) I answer three major objections: the evidentialist\u2019s charge of wishful thinking, the involuntarist\u2019s worry about doxastic control, and the skeptic\u2019s concern that veto-power is ad hoc.\n\n\n2. Why the Reasons Seem Incommensurable\n\nReasons differ in kind when their contributory force is explained by different background standards. Epistemic reasons get their normative force from a constitutive aim of belief: to represent the world truly. Practical reasons get their force from the broader aims of agency: to promote value, avoid harm, or respect duty. One can thus be epistemically impeccable and practically disastrous (e.g., harboring a justified racist belief that will certainly demoralize a vulnerable student) or practically admirable yet epistemically defective (e.g., sustaining hopeful over-confidence during chemotherapy).\n\nWhat generates the incommensurability worry is the tacit assumption that \u201cwhat one ought, simpliciter, to do\u201d must be settled by a single comparative metric. If no metric exists, the conclusion seems to follow that only one kind of reason is genuinely relevant, or else that the notion of an all-things-considered \u2018ought to believe\u2019 is incoherent. Yet the metric assumption is optional. Moral philosophers routinely work with plural values\u2014equality and liberty, say\u2014without insisting on translating everything into a single numerical currency. Likewise we can ask of a policy whether it dominates alternatives along several axes. The mistake is thinking that interaction entails aggregation. Interaction may instead take the form of conjoint constraint.\n\n\n3. Four Unsatisfactory Strategies\n\na) Reductionism. Some pragmatists (James, Peirce\u2019s broader disciples) argue that epistemic reasons are just a sub-class of practical reasons: truth matters only because true beliefs conduce to practical success. The reduction is implausible. We condemn wishful thinking even when it is harmless, and we admire the disinterested scientist who seeks truth at personal cost. Truth appears to have sui generis normative significance.\n\nb) Pure Evidentialism. At the opposite pole, strict evidentialists (Clifford, Conee & Feldman) deny that practical considerations ever count toward belief. They may matter for action taken on the basis of belief, but not for what to believe itself. Yet consider a doctor who must decide, before evidence is conclusive, whether a patient is contagious. Adopting the belief that the patient is contagious leads to immediate quarantine, potentially saving lives; withholding risks catastrophe. Our common-sense verdict is that the doctor ought (at least all things considered) to believe the patient is contagious. Pure evidentialism delivers the wrong result unless it allows evidence to include pragmatic stakes\u2014a maneuver that collapses the view into pragmatism.\n\nc) Lexical Priority. Some hybrid theorists, inspired by Rawls, give epistemic reasons lexical priority: practical reasons enter only when epistemic reasons exactly tie. The model is too rigid. Epistemic ties are rare; yet we seem to face genuine trade-offs in non-tie cases, such as accepting low-probability but life-saving hypotheses. Moreover, lexical priority misrepresents how extreme practical stakes can reasonably justify acting on less than conclusive evidence.\n\nd) Weighted Aggregation. Finally, some employ decision-theoretic machinery: assign utilities to truth/falsity and to practical outcomes, assign credences, compute expected utility. But two problems loom. First, belief is not action. Instrumental utilities relevant to action need not be the same as the normative standing of the belief as such. Second, the model forces us to assign cardinal values to truth itself, a controversial exercise at best.\n\nThese failures motivate seeking a non-aggregative pluralism\u2014precisely what the 2-DN supplies.\n\n\n4. The Two-Dimensional Norm Explored\n\n4.1. Normative Axes\n\nLet E(b) be the epistemic standing of believing proposition p (call the content b); let P(b) be the practical standing. E-standing ranges from \u22121 (maximally unjustified) through 0 (agnostic) to +1 (maximally justified). P-standing ranges from \u22121 (maximally disvaluable) through 0 to +1 (maximally valuable). The scales need not be inter-translatable; indeed, we stipulate that no cross-scale arithmetic is available.\n\n4.2. Permission, Dominance, and Veto\n\nDefine:\n\nDominance: b1 dominates b2 if E(b1) \u2265 E(b2) and P(b1) \u2265 P(b2) with at least one inequality strict. A dominated option is impermissible.\n\nEpistemic Veto: If E(b) falls below a contextually fixed threshold t_E (roughly, the minimal level of evidential support required for belief in that context), b is impermissible regardless of its P-standing.\n\nPractical Veto: If P(b) falls below a (possibly different) threshold t_P (reflecting stakes, moral duties, etc.), b is impermissible regardless of its E-standing.\n\nIf more than one option remains undominated and both thresholds are met, the subject is free to believe either (doxastic permissivism). Where no belief passes both vetoes, withholding is mandated. Interaction thus occurs not through weighing but through mutual constraint: an option must clear *both* hurdles.\n\n4.3. Why Thresholds, not Weights?\n\nThresholds (vetoes) reflect the non-compensatory character of the two domains. Extremely good practical consequences cannot redeem a belief that is radically under-evidenced; nor can impeccable evidence justify a belief whose adoption would produce grave, avoidable harm (for instance, broadcasting a partially confirmed rumor that might spark ethnic violence). The thresholds are context-sensitive because what counts as \u201cgrave harm\u201d or \u201cradically under-evidenced\u201d varies. Yet context-sensitivity is familiar from epistemology (standards of justification differ between idle speculation and courtroom testimony).\n\n4.4. Explaining Interaction Without Commensuration\n\nConsider a belief option b* with decent evidence (E = .7) but disastrous practical consequences (P = \u2212.9). Its P-standing triggers the practical veto, rendering it impermissible despite an epistemic score higher than denial or withholding. No weighing occurs. Conversely, a belief with flimsy evidence (E = .1) but tremendous practical payoffs (P = .9) fails epistemic threshold t_E (say, .3) and is barred. Only beliefs that are \u201cgood enough\u201d in *both* senses survive.\n\n\n5. Three Illustrative Cases\n\na) Pascalian Faith. Suppose theistic belief (T) has middling evidence for you (E = .4). On traditional Pascalian reasoning, P(T) could be high (infinite if heaven exists). Pure evidentialism forbids belief; pragmatism demands it. The 2-DN says: does E(T) clear t_E? If the context is \u201cintellectually responsible conviction about metaphysics,\u201d t_E may be .6: T fails and is impermissible. But if the context is \u201cpersonal existential crisis where adopting T will rescue one from destructive despair,\u201d t_E might be lower (.3) and P(T) easily surpasses t_P; T becomes permissible though not mandatory. The model explains why pragmatic arguments have force without implying that any scintilla of utility can swamp evidence.\n\nb) Emergency Medical Triage. A physician considering whether a patient has Disease X, for which early treatment is life-saving but the test results are inconclusive (probability .3). Waiting for confirmatory evidence risks death. The doctor\u2019s belief will guide immediate treatment. Here t_P is very high (lives at stake); t_E may be set lower than usual because false negatives are costly. Believing that the patient has X may pass both thresholds, hence is permissible; in fact denial might be dominated. We vindicate commonsense medical practice without conflating curing with believing.\n\nc) The Noble Lie. A commander falsely but sincerely tells soldiers that reinforcements are coming, boosting morale and increasing survival odds. Evidence is strongly against the belief (E = .1). Even if P is high, E falls below t_E for sincere belief, so she is not permitted to believe it herself\u2014though she may permissibly *assert* it. The model distinguishes permissible speech acts from permissible beliefs.\n\n6. Replies to Three Objections\n\nObjection 1: Evidentialism Redux\u2014Your view licenses wishful thinking.\n\nReply: Only beliefs that clear the epistemic threshold are candidates. Wishful thinking typically involves beliefs whose E-standing is far below t_E. Further, practical veto power typically restricts, not expands, license (e.g., forbidding harmful but evidentially secure beliefs). So 2-DN does not open the floodgates to epistemic irresponsibility.\n\nObjection 2: Doxastic Involuntarism\u2014Beliefs are not under voluntary control; vetoes and permissions are action-guiding but psychologically idle.\n\nReply: First, the norms guide *deliberative* control, a weaker but genuine form documented in cognitive science: agents can direct attention, seek counter-evidence, rehearse reasons, thereby influencing belief over time. Second, norms govern not only what we decide to believe but what attitudes we *sustain*\u2014we can intentionally retain or abandon commitment, as in sustained suspension during jury duty.\n\nObjection 3: Ad-Hoc Vetoes\u2014Thresholds look arbitrary. Why expect precisely two?\n\nReply: The thresholds emerge from two constitutive aims. Belief aims at truth; agency aims at value. Any normative system that recognizes both aims must set limits on how much deviation is tolerable. Too low a t_E collapses belief into wishful hope; too low a t_P ignores moral cost. Contextual variation is no more ad hoc than contextual variation in legal standards of \u201creasonable doubt.\u201d Finally, the two-threshold structure yields predictive power: it correctly distinguishes cases (noble lie vs. medical triage) that alternative theories conflate.\n\nAn additional theoretical virtue is completeness without cardinal comparability. A vector-dominance framework is mathematically tractable (one can import tools from decision theory under partial orders) yet respects qualitative pluralism.\n\n\n7. Comparative Advantages\n\nRelative to its rivals, 2-DN captures six attractive data points:\n\n1. Truth Has Non-Instrumental Value: Evidence cannot be trumped by any finite practical good.\n\n2. Stakes Matter: In high-stakes settings we do think practical considerations count; pure evidentialism cannot explain this.\n\n3. No Carte Blanche for Wish-Fulfillment: Practical reasons cannot justify believing what is obviously false.\n\n4. Permissive Zones: The view allows epistemic peers to permissibly differ when E is adequate and P neutral\u2014matching epistemic permissivism debates.\n\n5. Asymmetry Between Belief and Action: Belief\u2019s normative structure is sui generis, although consonant with pragmatic encroachment on knowledge (knowledge may require belief plus practical stakes).\n\n6. Social Epistemic Practice: Because t_P encodes moral-social stakes, 2-DN illuminates why norms of testimony, disclosure, and rumor control are partly practical.\n\n\n8. A Deeper Rationale: Second-Order Justification\n\nBehind the surface mechanics lies a deeper story. The very practice of forming beliefs and treating them as reasons for action is a social institution. Such an institution must balance two desiderata: accuracy (so that actions guided by beliefs succeed) and moral safety (so that the practice does not produce grave harm). At the level of rule selection, we can mount a rule-consequentialist argument: a community regulated solely by epistemic permission (pure evidentialism) is vulnerable to catastrophic downside risks; a community regulated solely by practical stakes encourages epistemic corruption. The jointly sufficient veto structure is the equilibrium that maximizes long-run epistemic and moral value. Thus the 2-DN is not ad hoc but reflectively stable in the Rawlsian sense: it is the set of norms we would endorse under conditions of impartial rational reflection about the governing rules of belief.\n\n\n9. Toward Further Research\n\nThree open questions invite exploration.\n\nFirst, what fixes the precise context-sensitive thresholds? One promising hypothesis is that they are shaped by institutional roles (physician, juror, scientist) with public expectations.\n\nSecond, does the 2-DN extend to credences (graded beliefs)? Preliminary work suggests we can model E and P as functions over probability distributions, introducing \u201ccredal thresholds\u201d without collapsing into pure Bayesian decision theory.\n\nThird, does the view illuminate the \u201cpragmatic encroachment\u201d debate about knowledge? If knowledge is the norm of assertion and action, then perhaps t_P tracks the pragmatic encroachment parameter in knowledge attribution. Bridging these literatures could yield new insights into social epistemology.\n\n\n10. Conclusion\n\nThe apparent incommensurability of epistemic and practical reasons does not force us to discard either kind, nor to distort one into a mere derivative of the other. By adopting a two-dimensional normative framework\u2014a structure of conjoint thresholds and dominance\u2014we can preserve the distinctive integrity of truth-directed justification while acknowledging the legitimate impact of moral and prudential stakes on doxastic life. The resulting picture vindicates our intuitive verdicts across a range of cases, avoids the pitfalls of crude aggregation, and offers a platform for further theoretical refinement. We need not weigh truth against value on a single scale; we need only ensure that our beliefs are good enough on both fronts to merit a rational agent\u2019s assent.", "output_tokens": 3912, "reasoning_tokens": 512}

Setting the Problem  \n\nDoxastic deliberation is ordinarily guided by epistemic reasons: considerations that bear on whether a proposition is true. Yet our ordinary and scientific practices are replete with talk of practical reasons for belief\u2014moral, prudential, or broadly value-laden considerations that seem to tell against (or in favour of) believing something independently of its evidential support. The humanitarian doctor who things \u201cBetter to trust the patient\u2019s report, for the cost of wrongly disbelieving is enormous,\u201d or the parent who half-willingly adopts the optimistic thought \u201cMy child will recover,\u201d both appear to treat non-evidential factors as legitimately doxastic.  \n\nThe puzzle is not whether such practical considerations ever influence us (empirically they do), but whether they *ought* to. Epistemic and practical reasons appear not merely different but incommensurable: the former are truth-oriented, the latter value-oriented. How, then, could a single all-things-considered verdict about what one *ought* to believe emerge from reasons that share no common currency?\n\n2. Thesis  \n\nI defend a two-level model of doxastic normativity.  \n\n(1) First-order belief is governed by a *constitutive* epistemic norm\u2014roughly, \u201cBelieve only what the evidence warrants.\u201d This norm has lexical priority: practical reasons cannot override it.  \n\n(2) Yet within the bounds of what the evidence *permits*\u2014a range that is often significantly indeterminate\u2014agents face discretionary space. Here, tie-breaking or fine-grained belief-forming is permissible but not required by the epistemic norm. Practical reasons can legitimately operate inside this space to determine which of several epistemically permissible doxastic attitudes one ought, all-things-considered, to adopt.  \n\nInteraction therefore does not demand cardinal commensuration. The relation is *sequential* and *constrained*, not additive: first epistemic reasons delimit what is thinkable as belief, then practical reasons select among the epistemically eligible options. Thus the attempt to place evidential and prudential considerations on a single scale is a false problem; they enter deliberation at distinct stages and never need to be weighed head-to-head.\n\n3. Clarifying the Terrain  \n\n3.1 Epistemic vs. Practical Reasons  \n\nEpistemic reasons:  \n\n\u2022 World-to-mind direction of fit.  \n\u2022 Normative force derives from the telos of belief\u2014truth or knowledge.  \n\u2022 Paradigm examples: perceptual data, testimony, explanatory coherence.  \n\nPractical reasons:  \n\n\u2022 Mind-to-world or value-to-mind direction of fit.  \n\u2022 Normative force derives from expected utility, moral duty, psychological welfare, etc.  \n\u2022 Paradigm examples: \u201cBelieving this will motivate me\u201d; \u201cDisbelieving could harm others.\u201d  \n\n3.2 The Incommensurability Worry  \n\nTo say that reasons are incommensurable is to say that no superordinate metric exists for comparing the strength of, e.g., \u201cMy evidence is 0.75 strong\u201d and \u201cBelieving will save a life.\u201d So how could a single ought be generated?\n\n4. The Constitutive Aim of Belief and Lexical Priority  \n\nMost meta-epistemic accounts\u2014David Velleman, Bernard Williams, Nishi Shah\u2014hold that belief is *constitutively* aimed at truth. Beliefs that would rather be useful than true have self-stultifying content: their own nature is to succeed just in case they correctly represent reality.  \n\nFrom this it follows that epistemic reasons enjoy lexical priority in doxastic deliberation. Compare: in practical reason, moral reasons are often taken to have lexical priority over aesthetic ones; we need not weigh saving a drowning child against the pleasure of finishing a sonata. Similarly, if a consideration directly supports the truth of p, and another concerns the utility of believing p, the latter cannot justify belief when the former decisively tells against it. Call this the *No-Overriding Constraint*:\n\nNOC: If S\u2019s evidence makes ~p more likely than p, no amount of practical benefit suffices to make it permissible for S to believe p.\n\n5. Epistemic Permissive Zones  \n\nCrucially, the NOC still leaves us with *epistemic permissive zones*. Evidence rarely fixes a unique doxastic attitude. Consider:\n\n(a) The *underdetermination* zone: when evidence for p and ~p is roughly balanced.  \n(b) The *credal vagueness* zone: evidential thresholds for belief vs. suspension are fuzzy.  \n(c) The *rapidly changing evidence* zone: where up-to-the-second data are inaccessible.  \n\nWithin such zones, more than one attitude\u2014believe, withhold, believe on partial credence\u2014can be epistemically permissible. Here the constitutive epistemic aim does not by itself dictate a unique verdict. This epistemic permissiveness is not an ad hoc invention; it is an upshot of any plausible fallibilist evidentialism.  \n\n6. Where Practical Reasons Step In  \n\nMy proposal: Practical reasons gain normative force only within these permissive zones. We can call the resulting normative architecture *Constraining Evidentialism*:\n\nCE-1: Only epistemic reasons determine the set E of doxastic attitudes that are permissible for S at t with respect to p.  \n\nCE-2: If |E| = 1, S is (all-things-considered) required to adopt that sole epistemically licensed attitude.  \n\nCE-3: If |E| > 1, practical reasons may legitimately select among members of E.  \n\nPractical reasons function here not as trumps but as tie-breakers. There is no need to compute \u201chow many utiles of accuracy\u201d equal \u201chow many utiles of moral benefit.\u201d The sequential nature of CE means the situations in which the putative incommensurability would matter simply never arise.\n\n7. Illustrative Cases  \n\n7.1 Medical Diagnostician  \n\nDr. Rao receives limited lab data roughly split between diagnosis A and B. Both are epistemically permissible beliefs; more evidence will arrive tomorrow. Treating for B now carries severe side effects, treating for A does not. CE says: because the evidence underdetermines, practical reasons (avoiding harm) permissibly push Rao to believe\u2014and therefore to act as if\u2014A.  \n\nNote that if the evidence tilted decisively toward B, CE-2 would kick in. Dr. Rao would be obliged to believe B despite the practical costs.  \n\n7.2 The Optimistic Parent  \n\nMaria\u2019s child faces an uncertain prognosis: recovery probability ~0.4. Both believing and withholding are epistemically permitted; disbelieving (the child will die) arguably outpaces the evidence. Maria justifiably forms a hopeful belief, bolstered by the practical reason that optimism improves caregiving quality. Her case is not wishful thinking but a rational exercise of discretionary space.  \n\n7.3 Clifford-Style Shipowner  \n\nThe Victorian shipowner who ignores glaring evidence of rot is in CE violation. Evidence fixes disbelief as the sole element of E; practical profit cannot shift him. Thus CE preserves the moral sting of Clifford\u2019s famous verdict while avoiding his strident evidential absolutism where evidence is inconclusive.\n\n8. Why Sequential Interaction Beats Alternative Theories  \n\n8.1 Expected Epistemic Utility (EEU)  \n\nEEU theories attempt to common-currency the two reason-types by translating truth conduciveness into accuracy utilities, then adding standard practical utilities. But (i) the choice of scoring rule is controversial; (ii) it treats obvious epistemic defeats as possibly outweighed by gigantic stakes (raising the spectre of betting-house irrationality); (iii) it misrepresents doxastic deliberation phenomenology, which is not calculative of ducats of accuracy. CE avoids these pitfalls by not forcing cardinal assimilation.  \n\n8.2 Pragmatic Encroachment  \n\nPragmatic encroachment (PI stakes theory) says practical factors affect whether one *knows* (Stanley, Fantl & McGrath) or whether belief is justified (Weatherson). But it does so by letting practical stakes modulate the threshold of sufficient evidence. This threatens the constitutive aim of belief: the same evidence could require or forbid belief solely because background utilities vary, collapsing truth orientation into value orientation. CE retains a non-relativized evidential threshold; what changes with stakes is only which doxastic option one ultimately ought to select where the threshold leaves room.  \n\n8.3 Dualism (Separate \u201cOughts\u201d)  \n\nAnother move is to say there are two entirely separate oughts: an epistemic ought and a pragmatic ought, neither trumping the other. But this re-creates the practical dilemma: which ought do I answer to when acting? CE integrates them without collapsing them.\n\n9. Objections and Replies  \n\nObjection 1 (Silencing): Sometimes practical reasons intuitively seem to *silence* epistemic reasons, e.g., cases of self-deception to preserve mental health. Doesn\u2019t CE forbid what we regard as permissible?  \n\nReply: The cases that look like silencing often involve defeat of the constitutive aim by overriding goals of agency as a whole. I concede that extreme cases (e.g., believing one will recover to survive placebo therapy) pose pressure on NOC. Yet we can recast them: the *object* of belief is ambiguous (will I recover *if I believe I will recover*?). Once evidence for that conditional is considered, the epistemic bar may indeed be met. Thus CE can accommodate many apparent silencing cases without real override.  \n\nObjection 2 (Too Epistemically Demanding): CE still forces us to withhold or disbelieve even when the stakes are astronomical (Pascalian cases).  \n\nReply: Not quite. Where evidence *decisively* indicates ~p, CE says believe ~p. But in typical Pascalian cases the relevant proposition (e.g., God exists) is not decisively undermined by evidence; we are again in a permissive zone. CE licenses but does not require faith. The view thus avoids both fanaticism and evidential neglect.  \n\nObjection 3 (What About Partial Belief?) Many argue the proper attitude is degrees of belief (credences). Does CE apply?  \n\nReply: Yes. Replace the set E with a *credal interval* allowed by evidence. Practical reasons may choose a sharp credence within that interval for decision-theoretic purposes. The same sequential architecture extends smoothly.\n\n10. Theoretical Payoffs  \n\n10.1 Explains \u201cDoxastic Wronging\u201d  \n\nPhilosophers puzzled by cases where accurate beliefs nevertheless wrong someone (e.g., sexist beliefs formed on limited evidence) can locate the wrong not in inaccurate belief but in bypassing epistemic permissive zones prematurely, or in appealing to illicit practical reasons outside such zones.  \n\n10.2 Resolves the Unity-of-Reason Worry  \n\nReasons are unified not by being in the same currency but by standing in a hierarchical order constrained by the constitutive aims of mental states: belief aims at truth, action aims at value. Similar architectures appear elsewhere: in art, technical competence constrains, then aesthetic creativity selects.  \n\n10.3 Generates Research Avenues  \n\n\u2022 Formal modelling: characterize evidential permissive zones via imprecise probabilities, then study optimal practical selection strategies.  \n\u2022 Moral encroachment: test empirically whether people\u2019s permissiveness judgments shrink as third-party harms rise, supporting CE\u2019s stage-two intervention.  \n\u2022 Mental health ethics: when, if ever, can therapy legitimately encourage belief outside epistemic permissive zones? CE offers a principled boundary.  \n\n11. Comparative Virtues  \n\nThe two-level account retains (i) the intuitive pull of evidentialism\u2014truth is non-negotiable\u2014while (ii) accommodating the lived reality that stakes matter, and (iii) dissolving the alleged need for incommensurable comparison. Because practical reasons only operate once evidence has done all the work it can reasonably do, there is never a juncture at which one must ask \u201cHow many epistemic points equal how many moral points?\u201d The interaction is a matter of *sequencing* rather than *scaling*.  \n\n12. Conclusion  \n\nThe apparent incommensurability of epistemic and practical reasons for belief arises from the mistaken assumption that they must be placed on the same deliberative scoreboard. A more accurate picture of doxastic agency is hierarchical. Epistemic reasons, grounded in the constitutive aim of belief, set non-negotiable constraints. But evidence normally underdetermines; within that epistemically licit space, agents rightly consult practical considerations\u2014moral, prudential, or aesthetic\u2014to decide what they, all things considered, ought to believe.  \n\nThus the two types of reasons do not clash; they collaborate by entering deliberation at different moments. The daunting problem of direct commensuration simply never arises. Far from undermining evidentialism, practical considerations vindicate its limits: they have their say only once truth-directed norms have spoken and found more than one path open.  \n\nOn this view, the doxastic life is neither monastically truth-obsessed nor cynically utility-driven. It is a structured partnership in which the love of truth and the care for value each govern in their proper domain\u2014and do so without ever needing to be weighed on a common scale.", "output_tokens": 3308, "reasoning_tokens": 448}

Setting the Puzzle  \n\nWe commonly think there is an important difference between two kinds of reasons for belief.  \n\n\u2022 Epistemic reasons track *truth-conduciveness*: evidence, reliability, explanatory power.  \n\u2022 Practical reasons track *value*: the moral, prudential, or broadly instrumental pay-offs of holding a belief.  \n\nBoth kinds of reasons seem genuine. I may have overwhelming statistical evidence that my teenage son is texting while driving (an epistemic reason to believe it), yet practical reasons\u2014my wish not to undermine trust or trigger panic while I am still collecting evidence\u2014may speak against *coming to believe it just now*. But how could these heterogeneous considerations be weighed against each other at all? Truth and trust, evidence and harm, appear *incommensurable*.  \n\nMy thesis is that the incommensurability worry is overstated. Epistemic and practical reasons are not two alien currencies requiring impossible conversion. They are better understood as distinct, default-governing *normative dimensions* that become comparable once we frame the problem at the right level of agency: that of an agent deciding **whether, when, and how firmly** to adopt a cognitive commitment. I develop a *pluralist-integrative model* with three main claims:\n\n1. There are indeed irreducibly epistemic and practical reasons, but they are alike in being *reasons for a single kind of act\u2010token*: managing one\u2019s doxastic state.  \n2. Because truth itself is a value\u2014and because believing falsely or prematurely can itself have practical costs\u2014both classes of reasons enter a more general value space.  \n3. Comparability is secured not by a single common metric but by *parity-based deliberation* (\u00e0 la Ruth Chang) governed by a defeasible priority rule: epistemic reasons normally dominate, yet sufficiently weighty practical reasons can override when the evidential margin is small or the stakes are extreme.\n\nThis triple-layer architecture rescues the intuition that evidence has a special, even constitutive, role in belief while explaining how\u2014without violating logic or the nature of belief\u2014practical considerations sometimes tip the scales.\n\n2. Why Existing Strategies Stall  \n\nA. Epistemic Purism  \nPurists (e.g., Adler, Shah) deny that practical considerations ever bear on what one **ought** to believe. On their view, norms of belief are constitutively aimed at truth, so non\u2010epistemic reasons are categorically excluded. Yet the purist owes us an explanation for everyday cases where we *seem* blameworthy for believing on lousy but convenient evidence (wishful thinking) or, conversely, for *refusing* to believe when high stakes counsel caution despite decent evidence (medical diagnoses, intelligence assessments). Pure evidence cannot always shoulder that burden.\n\nB. Pragmatic Reduction  \nAt the other extreme, pragmatists (James, pragmatic encroachers) dissolve the dualism by redescribing epistemic reasons as just a special subset of practical reasons: believing truths is generally useful. But this erases the felt asymmetry between being wrong because unlucky and being wrong because reckless; it cannot explain why lottery beliefs are epistemically criticisable even when harmless.\n\nC. Two-Box Accounting  \nThe most popular compromise simply keeps two score sheets: an *epistemic ought* and a *practical ought*, declining to deliver an *all-things-considered* (ATC) verdict. This avoids hard trade-offs but at the cost of guidance. Agents need to know, finally, whether to believe that their son was texting. Moral psychologists, lawyers, and physicians clearly form beliefs under combined pressures; a split norm tells them *which norm they violate*, not *what to do*.\n\n3. From Doxastic States to Doxastic Agency  \n\nThe key move is to notice that belief formation is not a brute reflex but an activity *implicitly controlled* by agents through attention, information-search, evidential thresholds, and cognitive style. Even if we cannot directly will a belief, we can decide to invoke mechanisms that predictably lead to one. Those mechanisms are *actions*, and reasons\u2014of any kind\u2014are, fundamentally, reasons for agents to act. This shared action-relative format supplies the common denominator the incommensurability argument claimed impossible.\n\nConsider a physician confronting equivocal lab results for a rare but fatal disease:\n\nEvidence: 60% likelihood given symptoms.  \nOutcome stakes: Early treatment saves life; unnecessary treatment is mildly harmful.  \n\nHere believing (\u201cthe patient has disease D\u201d) triggers immediate treatment. A merely epistemic calculus might license 0.6 credence but not full belief. Practical stakes, however, press in: failing to treat if the disease is real is catastrophic. The physician thus has reason to *err on the side of believing*\u2014not because evidence is dismissed but because, given limited time, the *action profile associated with belief* maximises expected value. The belief is adopted through deliberate threshold-lowering: a paradigmatic exercise of doxastic agency.\n\n4. Truth as a Value Among Others  \n\nWhy doesn\u2019t this collapse into pragmatic reduction? Because the model, while value-based, recognises *multiple irreducible values*, one of which is veritic. Truth (and avoidance of error) carries intrinsic worth; it does not have to be cashed out in hedons or dollars. What makes epistemic reasons distinctive is precisely the weight they attach to this veritic value. What makes practical reasons distinctive is their sensitivity to other values (well-being, morality, legality, aesthetics). The higher-order deliberation weighs heterogeneous values without presuming cardinal commensuration, just as one routinely balances justice and mercy when sentencing or artistry and cost when designing a building.\n\n5. Parity and Priority: A Decision Rule\n\nStill, how is the weighing done? I propose a two-step rule.\n\nStep 1. *Parity Check.* Following Chang, two options can be \u201con a par\u201d: neither better nor worse nor equal yet still *comparable*. Epistemic and practical considerations can render \u201cbelieve p\u201d and \u201cwithhold\u201d on a par when evidence is modest and stakes are ordinary. Parity licenses agent discretion without arbitrariness; where reasons conflict but do not decisively outweigh, either option can be permissible.\n\nStep 2. *Defeasible Epistemic Priority.* Because belief is constitutively aimed at truth, epistemic reasons enjoy a rebuttable presumption. Practical reasons can override only when (a) the epistemic margin is small (e.g., evidence <0.7), and (b) practical stakes cross a context-sensitive threshold (e.g., catastrophic loss or grave moral wrong if the belief\u2019s associated actions err). This captures our sense that believing against overwhelming evidence is reckless, yet withholding belief in high-risk scenarios is timid.\n\n6. Illuminating Examples  \n\nExample 1: The High-Stakes Bridge  \nYou have 90% confidence, based on visual inspection, that an old bridge will hold your car. Crossing saves your injured child\u2019s life; detouring means death. Epistemic reasons favour belief that the bridge is safe (0.9 is strong). Practical reasons *scream* for crossing. Here there is no conflict: both align. The framework recovers the intuition that action and belief coincide without reducing one to the other.\n\nExample 2: The Firing Rumor  \nAn employee hears a rumor she will be laid off. Evidence: weak (gossip). Believing prematurely would provoke panic; withholding belief allows calm job-search preparation. Practical reasons counsel suspension. Epistemic reasons are weak. Parity obtains; withholding is permissible.\n\nExample 3: The Conspiratorial Neighbor  \nA man suspects, on flimsy grounds, that his neighbor is a spy. Believing it would prompt dangerous confrontation. Practical reasons oppose belief. But evidence is far below threshold; the epistemic priority rule already forbids belief. The agent cannot invoke practical stakes to justify a belief hog-tied by evidence.\n\nExample 4: Vaccine Hesitancy  \nA parent faces overwhelming scientific evidence that vaccines are safe, but fears slim possibilities of side effects. Practical stakes (child\u2019s welfare) are high on *both* sides. The epistemic margin is decisive; practical reasons do not override. The model condemns anti-vax belief as irrational.\n\nThese examples show that the framework yields nuanced, intuitive verdicts across contexts.\n\n7. Replies to Major Objections  \n\nObjection A: \u201cBelief isn\u2019t voluntary; reasons for action do not apply.\u201d  \nReply: Full voluntary control is unnecessary. Reasons routinely apply to states under *indirect* control\u2014emotions, habits, implicit biases. What matters is that agents can modulate evidence gathering, attention, and doxastic thresholds. The reasons address those control points.\n\nObjection B: \u201cMixing values invites wishful thinking.\u201d  \nReply: The defeasible priority rule blocks the slide. Wishful thinking typically ignores strong counter-evidence; my account refuses practical override when the epistemic margin is wide. Only in cases of evidential ambiguity does value tilt the scale.\n\nObjection C: \u201cConstitutive Aim Purism: Truth is an internal norm; practical override violates the nature of belief.\u201d  \nReply: The analogy is fallacious. A constitutive aim sets *default standards* but does not make them lexically supreme. Games aim at winning, yet sportsmanship can rightly require losing (throwing a match for moral protest). Likewise, belief aims at truth, yet morality can require withholding (consider counterspeech under totalitarianism when truthful belief endangers innocents).\n\nObjection D: \u201cComparability without a common metric is hand-waving.\u201d  \nReply: Moral deliberation often involves incomparable values (freedom vs. equality). Decision theorists use *multi-criteria* models, lexicographic orders, or satisficing thresholds. Human agents clearly make such comparative judgments; the philosophical task is to articulate their rationality, not deny their possibility.\n\n8. Distinctions Doing Work  \n\n\u2022 *Reasons vs. Requirements.* A reason may be overridden; a requirement cannot. My model features overriding, not violation, of epistemic reasons.  \n\u2022 *Evidence vs. Epistemic Value.* Not all evidence is equally truth-promoting; some is misleading. Distinguishing the *possession* of evidence from its *probative force* explains why sometimes little evidence can be trumped.  \n\u2022 *Belief vs. Credence.* Belief is a categorical commitment; credence is graded. Practical stakes frequently operate by pushing agents to shift the belief/withhold threshold, leaving underlying credence untouched.\n\n9. Substantive Pay-Offs  \n\nThe pluralist-integrative account has three notable upshots:\n\n1. **Explains encroachment phenomena** (financial stakes, moral luck cases) without collapsing epistemology into pragmatics.  \n2. **Illuminates epistemic blameworthiness.** An agent who ignores weighty moral considerations when forming belief (e.g., racist profiling) is criticisable even with decent evidence because the practical harms override.  \n3. **Guides policy** on information disclosure, medical counseling, and legal standards. For instance, \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d can be reinterpreted as setting a *socially calibrated override threshold* where the practical costs of false conviction outweigh the value of truth in that domain.\n\n10. Conclusion  \n\nEpistemic and practical reasons do not live in sealed normative silos. They interact because agents do more than passively mirror evidence; they manage their cognitive lives amid plural values. Once truth is recognised as an intrinsic value and belief formation as an agency-laden process, comparability follows, not via crude commensuration but through parity-sensitive deliberation with a rational defeasible priority for evidence. The result is a unified yet pluralistic picture\u2014one that honours the constitutive importance of truth while acknowledging that, in the world we inhabit, values sometimes rightly ask us to wait, to doubt, or even, on rare occasions, to believe beyond the strict letter of the evidence.", "output_tokens": 3611, "reasoning_tokens": 1088}

On the other are reasons of prudence or morality, whose currency is well-being, justice, or solidarity.  If I discover that a pill will save my child\u2019s life only if I believe it will, my strongest practical reason seems to be **to believe**\u2014but the evidence may be flimsy.  How could one even begin to weigh \u201csaving a life\u201d against \u201cfitting the evidence\u201d?  We appear to face an impossible calculus and, with it, the threat of normative schizophrenia.\n\nI shall argue that the impasse is at once deeper and less threatening than it first appears.  Deeper, because the incommensurability diagnosis rests on a plausible but mistaken **monistic** assumption: that there is a single, one-place normative predicate \u201cought to believe\u201d whose truth-conditions must be settled by adding epistemic and practical reasons into the same scale.  Less threatening, because once we abandon that monism in favor of a **two-tier pluralist account**, we can make perfect sense of interaction without forcing heterogenous reasons into a common metric.\n\nMy thesis:\n\n1.   Epistemic and practical reasons govern **different normative roles**\u2014roughly, *what to believe conditional on taking up the role of an inquirer* versus *whether (and when, and at what cost) to take up that role*.\n\n2.   Because the roles are nested, the two kinds of reasons interact **sequentially rather than arithmetically**: practical reasons set the stage on which epistemic reasons then play out unchallenged.  \n\n3.   The apparent need for direct commensuration is therefore an artefact of a category mistake.  Once the mistake is diagnosed, the normative landscape is intelligible and, indeed, predictively powerful in familiar cases of moral encroachment, high-stakes deliberation, and self-deception.\n\nI develop the view in four steps.\n\nI.  Diagnosing the monistic assumption  \nII. Reframing belief as role-indexed agency  \nIII. Sequential interaction: a model  \nIV. Objections and pay-offs  \n\nI.  Diagnosing the Monistic Assumption  \n\nThe thought that there is **one** \u201cought\u201d governing belief flows from two influential pictures.\n\na)  The **intention model**: believing is a species of mental affirmation, structurally parallel to intending.  Since both are pro\u2010attitudes, the norms that govern them should integrate seamlessly.\n\nb)  The **buck-passing model**: to say \u201cS ought to believe p\u201d is just to say that the total balance of reasons favors p.  If that is correct, then epistemic and practical reasons must be capable of balancing on the same scale; otherwise, the comparison is undefined.\n\nEach picture has intuitive bite, but both conceal a conceptual slide.  They treat belief\u2019s **constitutive aim at truth** as merely one kind of reason among others.  Epistemologists from Alston to Shah have urged that the aim is constitutive in a thicker way: it is built into the very *role* of believer as such.  A \u201cbeliever\u201d who is indifferent to truth is like a \u201cdoctor\u201d indifferent to healing; the title ceases to apply.  The upshot is that epistemic reasons do not merely *augment* the ledger; they define the ledger relevant to the believer\u2019s role.  The difficulty in adding practical reasons therefore signals a deeper point: we have conflated two distinct normative assessments.\n\nII.  Reframing Belief as Role-Indexed Agency  \n\nConsider an analogy with games.  In chess, a player has chess-internal reasons (maximize positional advantage) and life-reasons (do not neglect your child to blitz online for five more hours).  These two sorts of reasons interact, but not by summing to a single \u201coverall move reason\u201d for or against advancing a pawn.  Instead, the reasons operate at different levels:\n\n1.  Life-reasons decide *whether* to play, or how seriously, or whether to resign early to soothe the child.\n2.  Conditional on playing, chess-internal reasons alone determine good moves.\n\nCrucially, we do not find it mysterious how the levels interact.  If the child\u2019s welfare trumps the value of winning, you might rationally resign.  Having resigned, there is no longer a question about which chess move is best; you have left the activity.  Inside the game, however, only chess-norms speak.\n\nBelief, I submit, is remarkably similar.  The act of taking a proposition as true\u2014genuine conviction rather than mere entertainment\u2014imports you into a practice whose constitutive value is truth.  Once inside the practice, you evaluate candidate beliefs by their evidential support, explanatory coherence, etc.  Stepping *into* or *out of* that practice (for this question, with what stringency, under what time constraints, with what tolerance for error) is itself a choice subject to practical reasons.\n\nRole-indexed agency helps dissolve the incommensurability.  Epistemic and practical reasons are not competing coinages.  They are currencies traded in different markets, linked through an exchange rate that is not a brute conversion formula but a *choice of whether to trade at all*.\n\nIII.  Sequential Interaction: A Model  \n\nA. The Architecture\n\nLet us formalize the sequential account.\n\nStage 0:  The agent confronts a decision context C.\n\nStage 1 (Role uptake):  Practical reasons R\u1d56 evaluate three options:\n   (i)   Adopt the role of inquirer regarding p (commit to truth-aimed belief) now,\n   (ii)  Suspend judgment (defer the role),\n   (iii) Refrain permanently from believing about p (exit the role).\n\nStage 2 (Within-role deliberation):  Conditional on choosing (i), epistemic reasons R\u1d49 govern whether to believe p, \u00acp, or remain agnostic.\n\nImportantly, R\u1d56 may be sensitive to the expected epistemic costs and benefits that flow from Stage 2.  Just as parents weigh the enjoyment of chess against childcare, an agent may weigh the benefits of forming a belief now (saving the child with the pill) against the risk of being wrong.\n\nB.  Risk and Standard\n\nThe model predicts the pragmatic encroachment data that have driven recent debates.  Suppose the practical stakes of error are high.  Then in Stage 1, R\u1d56 will recommend either *raising* the evidential threshold necessary for role uptake or else suspending judgment altogether.  That appears, from the outside, as if pragmatic factors are \u201cdemanding more evidence\u201d before you can responsibly say you know.  But on the present view, no genuine balancing of unlike reasons occurs at Stage 2; the balance already happened when deciding how strict to be, or whether to participate.\n\nC. The \u201cGood Illusion\u201d Case\n\nReturn to the life-saving pill scenario: unless I believe the medicine works, my child will not take it.  Evidence is shaky; epistemic reasons incline me to doubt.  How does my model handle the case?\n\nStage 1: Practical reasons strongly favor *entering* the inquirer role quickly, because delay risks a life.  They also cast serious doubt on suspending judgment: that would leave my child unmedicated.\n\nStage 2: Within the role, epistemic reasons do their thing and recommend disbelief.  So we face a standoff?  No, because Stage 1 supplies a further option: **create evidence**, for instance by reading clinical studies, phoning experts, running a quick test.  If acquiring evidence is unfeasible in time, Stage 1 may instruct me to exit the role temporarily and instead adopt a *different* doxastic attitude such as imaginative acceptance.  What Stage 1 cannot coherently do is command me to believe on insufficient evidence while at the same time commanding me to stay within the role of believer.  To believe *qua believer* just is to be guided by epistemic reasons.\n\nThe upshot is elegant: practical reasons can press me to reshape the epistemic context (gather more data, loosen or tighten time constraints) or to withdraw from epistemic activity (withhold belief), but they never literally trade off against evidence inside the inferential space.\n\nD.  Multi-Dimensional Scoring Rules\n\nA formal analogue comes from **risk-weighted proper scoring rules** in epistemic utility theory.  We score credences by two axes: accuracy and pragmatic loss given particular decision stakes.  Pre-deliberation, an agent chooses a rule appropriate to her environment (thereby setting a risk parameter).  Once the rule is chosen, accuracy is the sole metric inside the rule, though its contours reflect pragmatic stakes.  The sequential account mirrors that architecture: practical reasons choose the epistemic rule; epistemic reasons then evaluate credences under that rule.  \n\nIV.  Objections and Pay-Offs  \n\nObjection 1:  \u201cYour view collapses practical reasons into a meta-epistemic level; but the initial worry concerned first-order conflict\u2014cases where morality seems to say \u2018Believe!\u2019 despite poor evidence.\u201d  \n\nReply:  The apparent first-order command is better construed as a compound directive: (i) adopt the doxastic attitude that serves the moral end, (ii) do so by exiting (or not yet entering) the believer role.  That attitude might be *make-believing*, *assuming for the sake of action*, or *faith* in a sui generis sense.  Linguistic conflation of such attitudes with belief generates the illusion of direct conflict.  Once we keep the attitude taxonomy explicit, no contradiction arises.\n\nObjection 2:  \u201cBut some philosophers (e.g., pragmatic encroachment theorists) think practical stakes directly modulate knowledge; the sequential story seems to predict modulation only via role uptake, not within-role epistemic evaluation.\u201d  \n\nReply:  The theory distinguishes **two encroachment phenomena**:\n\na)  Threshold variation: high stakes raise the bar for knowledge because responsible agents voluntarily set stricter evidence standards.  This is exactly the Stage-1 effect.\n\nb)  Genuine evidential shift: sometimes practical facts provide evidence (e.g., that the train almost never leaves early is evidence you need not sprint).  That is no violation; practical facts enter as ordinary propositions bearing on likelihoods.\n\nWhat the model denies is *pure value-driven belief adoption* without mediating evidential or threshold shift.  And that is precisely the locus of alleged incommensurability.\n\nObjection 3:  \u201cIsn\u2019t refusing to believe sometimes itself epistemically criticisable?  Suppose someone suspends judgment purely to avoid anxiety despite having overwhelmingly strong evidence; isn\u2019t that an epistemic fault?\u201d  \n\nReply:  Yes\u2014the sequential account allows that practical reasons can be defeated by higher-order epistemic norms governing intellectual virtue.  Roles are nested: practical reasons govern entry into belief, but they do not license arbitrary exit; chronic evasion of inquiry undermines the very integrity of the cognitive agent.  In chess terms, forfeiting every game to keep one\u2019s rating intact eventually makes one not a player at all.  That judgment arises because *higher-order* epistemic reasons bear on the rationality of role-uptake strategies themselves.  The architecture is richer than a two-level stack but the guiding principle persists: comparison occurs only within homogeneous reason kinds at each level.\n\nPay-offs  \n\n1.  Diagnostic Clarity.  The view explains why philosophers oscillate between \u201ctruth is paramount\u201d and \u201csometimes morality trumps evidence.\u201d  Each slogan is correct in its own register.\n\n2.  Explaining Doctrines of Faith.  The sequential model neatly captures Kierkegaardian faith leaps.  Faith suspends the ordinary believer role while adopting a distinct stance governed by non-epistemic aims\u2014a tidy theoretical reconciliation rather than a messy compromise.\n\n3.  Research Program.  By distinguishing role-uptake strategies, we invite empirical and game-theoretic study of which strategies maximize long-run epistemic and practical goods.  The proposal thus opens quantitative as well as conceptual avenues.\n\nConclusion  \n\nThe specter of incommensurability dissipates once we recognize that \u201cought to believe\u201d is not a monolithic verdict reached by putting truth and value onto a single scale.  Belief formation is a structured activity: we decide **whether and when to inquire** and, conditional on that, **what the evidence supports**.  Practical reasons speak to the first decision; epistemic reasons to the second.  Their interaction is genuine but **sequential**\u2014and that structure, not arithmetic aggregation, makes sense of our intuitions about moral encroachment, high-stakes knowledge, and permissible suspension.  The puzzle was real, but the solution lay in seeing that we had mistakenly demanded commensuration where only coordination was needed.", "output_tokens": 3298, "reasoning_tokens": 512}

Each delivers reasons\u2014epistemic and practical\u2014that seem to bear on what we ought, in some sense, to believe.  Yet the two kinds of reason appear incommensurable.  Truth does not admit of more or less of the goods that practical reasons trade in, and welfare does not track closeness to the facts.  How, then, could they jointly determine what one ought (full-stop) to believe?  Must we shoe-horn them onto a single scale, deny that they genuinely interact, or abandon the thought that belief is ever under the jurisdiction of practical reason?\n\nI argue that no such extreme is needed.  The apparent incommensurability dissolves once we recognize that \u201cought to believe\u201d is multiply realizable: it functions at two distinct normative levels, each governed by its own currency, but united through an agency bridge-principle.  \n\nThesis.  Epistemic reasons govern first-order doxastic correctness: whether a particular belief is accurate.  Practical reasons govern second-order doxastic agency: which policies for managing one\u2019s belief-forming mechanisms an agent should adopt.  Because the two levels are linked by an enkratic bridge (roughly: one ought not to treat as correct what one believes one ought to avoid), epistemic and practical reasons can interact without being weighed on a single, common scale.  They do so hierarchically rather than arithmetically.  The result is a unified but layered picture of doxastic normativity that respects the distinctiveness of each reason-type while explaining their joint impact on what an agent, all-things-considered, should believe.\n\nAfter clarifying the central distinctions (Section 2), I develop the hierarchical model (Section 3), illustrate it with three instructive cases (Section 4), answer leading objections (Section 5), and close by drawing two broader morals for theories of rationality (Section 6).\n\n2. Disentangling the Normative Vocabulary of Belief\n\nThe root of the impasse is semantic: we ambiguously speak of \u201cought to believe\u201d in at least three ways.\n\n(A) Epistemic correctness-ought.  Atomistic and teleological: a belief is correct if and only if its content is true (Boghossian 2003).  Reasons here are purely evidential: indicators of truth.\n\n(B) Deliberative ought.  What belief is it rational for me to adopt, in situ, given everything I care about?  This is the \u201cought\u201d that must guide deliberation if rational agents are to be responsive to reasons writ large.\n\n(C) Evaluative ought.  From the perspective of a third-person assessor, is the agent admirable or criticisable for holding that belief, given her situation?\n\nOnly (A) is purely epistemic.  (B) and (C) invite practical considerations.  Confusion arises when we assume there is a single \u201cought\u201d at work.  Instead, the normative landscape for belief is layered:\n\nLevel 1: First-order doxastic states, answerable to correctness-ought (A).  \nLevel 2: Higher-order control over doxastic mechanisms\u2014what policies to adopt in inquiry, how to manage evidence, whether to seek therapy, etc.\u2014answerable to deliberative-ought (B) and therefore sensitive to practical stakes.\n\nThis layered picture lets us acknowledge two theses that otherwise seem incompatible:\n\nTruth-Purism.  The constitutive aim of belief is truth; practical advantages cannot turn a falsehood into a correct belief.  \nPragmatic Relevance.  Because we are responsible agents who care about more than accuracy, practical reasons legitimately bear on how we manage belief formation.\n\n3. The Hierarchical Model\n\n3.1. First-Order Rationality: The Epistemic Core  \nAt Level 1, epistemic reasons are decisive.  If p is true, p is correct to believe; if evidence makes p highly probable, p is epistemically justified.  Practical benefits do not add weight in this space, for the normative currency here is accuracy or truthlikeness (Joyce 1998, Pettigrew 2016).  This level constitutes the \u201capple\u201d side of our incommensurability worry.\n\n3.2. Second-Order Rationality: Policy Selection  \nBut real-world believers are agents who exert indirect control over their beliefs: they choose whom to trust, whether to investigate, how strictly to scrutinise counter-evidence, whether to take medication that dampens paranoia, and so on.  Choices about these control levers are actions, not beliefs, and so naturally fall under practical evaluation.  Here the relevant currency can include moral value, psychological welfare, or instrumental utility\u2014the \u201corange\u201d side.\n\n3.3. The Bridge Principle: Enkratic Doxastic Agency  \nA hierarchical system needs a link.  The bridge principle I rely on is a doxastic analogue of the familiar enkratic requirement for action:  \nIf an agent judges that she ought (deliberatively) to adopt policy \u03c0, she ought (all-things-considered) to take the steps necessary to implement \u03c0, on pain of practical irrationality.\n\nWhen the chosen policy predictably leads to certain beliefs, those beliefs inherit derivative all-things-considered justification: the agent can properly say \u201cI ought, given everything that matters, to believe p,\u201d even though at Level 1 p might be epistemically sub-optimal relative to the available evidence.  Crucially, this derivative justification never converts a falsehood into an epistemically correct belief; it only renders the agent rationally permissible in possessing it, given the pragmatic stakes encoded in the policy.\n\n3.4. Why No Commensuration Is Needed  \nBecause practical reasons act only at Level 2 and epistemic reasons only at Level 1, they are not placed on the same scale to be weighed head-to-head.  The weighing occurs only among reasons of the same level: evidence competes with evidence; welfare concerns compete with welfare concerns.  Interaction occurs via temporal sequencing, not algebraic aggregation.  What matters practically may license adopting a policy whose foreseeable epistemic cost is acceptable, much as one may rationally take a medication with known side-effects because the expected health benefit outweighs them.\n\n4. Three Test Cases\n\n4.1. The Cancer Diagnosis  \nA doctor has strong but not conclusive evidence that a patient\u2019s lesion is malignant.  Disclosing that tentative belief would induce extreme stress that, if unwarranted, will materially harm the patient\u2019s recovery prospects.  She considers delaying disclosure until the biopsy is in.\n\nLevel 1.  Epistemically, the doctor should assign high probability to malignancy; the evidence favours it.  \nLevel 2.  Practically, she ought to adopt a policy of epistemic humility when stakes are high for others\u2019 welfare.  This policy recommends withholding definitive statements until confirmatory data arrive.\n\nThe result: she is all-things-considered justified in not yet believing (and not yet saying) \u201cthe lesion is malignant\u201d despite high evidential support.  No commensuration was needed; policy selection screened off the direct conflict.\n\n4.2. Pascal\u2019s Wager  \nPascal urges belief in God on prudential grounds: infinite expected utility trumps meagre epistemic evidence.\n\nOn the hierarchical model, Pascal\u2019s argument targets Level 2: adopt a policy (\u201cengage in doxastic self-manipulation if the payoff is huge\u201d) that leads to believing in God.  But such a policy clashes with deeper practical commitments\u2014intellectual integrity, coordination with the epistemic community\u2014that also bear on Level 2.  Once those are tallied, the policy looks less attractive.  Hence the model explains both the initial intuitive pull of the wager (it is, after all, a practical reason) and why many find it unsatisfying (it neglects higher-order practical costs).\n\n4.3. Self-Deception for Mental Health  \nSuppose believing that one\u2019s spouse is faithful will avert a depressive spiral though the evidence points strongly to infidelity.\n\nLevel 1 says the belief would be epistemically unjustified.  \nAt Level 2, we confront the policy: \u201cPermit belief without sufficient evidence to protect mental health.\u201d  Because such a policy threatens large-scale epistemic dysfunction (it licenses systematic self-deception), strong Level-2 practical reasons\u2014effective long-term agency, respect for persons involved\u2014count heavily against it.  The agent may instead adopt a therapeutic policy (seek counselling) that preserves epistemic integrity without sacrificing mental health.  Again, no head-to-head weighing of bits of evidence against bits of welfare is required.\n\n5. Objections and Replies\n\nObjection 1: \u201cYour model denies that practical reasons ever bear directly on belief.  But some philosophers (e.g., pragmatic encroachers) argue that practical stakes can raise or lower the evidential threshold for knowledge.  Isn\u2019t that a direct interaction?\u201d  \n\nReply: Pragmatic encroachment can be recast as a Level-2 phenomenon.  High stakes trigger policies of heightened evidence-gathering before treating p as settled.  What shifts is not the epistemic standard of correctness at Level 1 but the practical policy for when to close inquiry.  Indeed, empirical work on confidence calibration supports this picture: people adjust information-seeking thresholds when errors are costly, a behavioural manifestation of Level-2 agency.\n\nObjection 2: \u201cYou\u2019ve merely pushed the problem upstairs.  If practical reasons conflict with each other at Level 2\u2014say, utility maximisation vs. moral duty\u2014we still face incommensurability.\u201d  \n\nReply: True, plural values can conflict at Level 2, but that conflict is familiar from action theory and need not perplex us specially about belief.  My claim is not that commensuration problems vanish but that they do not differ in kind from ordinary practical deliberation.  The unique worry about cross-categorical weighing (truth vs. welfare) dissolves because they never compete at the same decision point.\n\nObjection 3: \u201cWhat about enveloping cases in which the only practical avenue to a good outcome is believing against the evidence\u2014no time for policy manipulation or evidence gathering?\u201d  \n\nReply: Even here the model retains its force.  If doxastic involuntarism precludes direct Level-1 control, the agent\u2019s only lever is still Level-2: she can attempt psychological techniques (self-suggestion, memory suppression) that probabilistically induce the beneficial belief.  The practical justification covers employing such techniques, not the belief\u2019s correctness.  That is enough for an all-things-considered ought directed at the agent\u2019s deliberation: she ought to try to bring about that belief.  Whether she succeeds, and whether the resulting belief is epistemically justified, are further questions answered separately.\n\nObjection 4: \u201cYour bridge principle invites akrasia: an agent might judge she ought to adopt a policy but fail to do so.\u201d  \n\nReply: Correct\u2014agents are fallible.  The enkratic bridge is a normative requirement, not a descriptive law.  Its violation explains a familiar irrationality: someone who judges she ought to moderate online news consumption for mental health yet continues doom-scrolling.  Recognising two levels enables clearer diagnosis rather than compounding confusion.\n\n6. Two Morals\n\nFirst Moral:  Epistemic normativity is narrower than often assumed.  It tells us what beliefs are accurate, not what believers, as practical agents embedded in value-laden lives, ought simpliciter to do with their cognitive faculties.  Conflating these yields the illusion of incommensurable weighing.  \n\nSecond Moral:  Practical agency over belief is richer than mere \u201cdeciding to believe.\u201d  Indirect control\u2014setting inquiry policies, shaping one\u2019s evidential environment, outsourcing to trustworthy experts\u2014creates a space where practical and epistemic values interact fruitfully without erasing their distinctive currencies.  A mature epistemology must therefore intersect with ethics and action theory, not because epistemic and practical reasons amalgamate into one mushy soup, but because they relate hierarchically within the architecture of rational agency.\n\nConclusion\n\nApples and oranges cannot be weighed on one kitchen scale, yet real cooks somehow compose balanced meals of fruit salad.  Likewise, epistemic and practical reasons answer to different standards yet jointly guide rational believers through a layered structure of norms.  At the first tier, accuracy reigns supreme: epistemic reasons alone determine correctness.  At the second tier, agents choose policies for belief-management under the purview of practical reasons.  An enkratic bridge links the tiers, allowing derivative justification for the beliefs those policies predictably engender.  No forced commensuration, no abandonment of either value, and no mysticism about \u201cpragmatic belief\u201d: just the ordinary artistry of agency working across levels.  Recognising the hierarchy dissolves the alleged paradox and reveals a satisfying division of normative labour\u2014one that any philosopher, whether lover of apples or of oranges, can savour.", "output_tokens": 3490, "reasoning_tokens": 640}

Introduction and Thesis  \nA decade of mirror-neuron enthusiasm has encouraged a simple story: to see another\u2019s movement as goal-directed, I must covertly \u201crun\u201d that movement in my own motor cortex. Call this the Necessity Thesis (NT). I shall argue that NT is false. Motor resonance is neither conceptually nor empirically necessary for perceiving goal-directed actions. Instead it is one\u2014often useful\u2014route among several that visual, cognitive, and ecological systems exploit. I defend a Multi-Channel View (MCV):\n\nMCV: Human observers possess at least two partially independent channels for representing another\u2019s action as goal-directed.  \n  (i) Kinematic Simulation Channel (KSC): resonance-based, exploits overlap between observed and executable movements.  \n  (ii) Teleological Heuristics Channel (THC): resonance-independent, relies on abstract spatiotemporal regularities, environmental affordances, and statistical priors about agents.\n\nKSC can speed and enrich understanding when overlap exists, but THC suffices for goal attribution in its absence. The argument unfolds in six steps: conceptual analysis (\u00a72); why resonance appears necessary (\u00a73); four empirical counter-examples (\u00a74); a positive model of THC (\u00a75); replies to three objections (\u00a76); broader implications (\u00a77).\n\n2. Clarifying \u201cPerception of Goal-Directed Action\u201d  \nPerception, action, and goal are slippery terms. NT is plausible partly because these ambiguities mask unwarranted leaps. I propose three distinctions that will structure the debate.\n\n2.1 Event Segmentation vs. Goal Identification  \nOne task is parsing a continuous motion stream into discrete events (\u201cshe reaches,\u201d \u201cshe grasps\u201d). A second task is recognizing the teleological profile of a segment (\u201cshe is reaching in order to drink\u201d). NT concerns the second task; few theorists think motor resonance is needed merely to spot a hand-path discontinuity.\n\n2.2 Motor Equivalence vs. Motor Feasibility  \nMy motor system may not literally reproduce every micro-movement of yours, yet functional resonance could still occur at a more abstract level (e.g., a goal vector). NT\u2019s strongest form says some isomorphism in executable motor commands is required. We must ask: required at what grain?\n\n2.3 Perceptual vs. Inferential Attribution  \nSome philosophers (e.g., Siegel, Nanay) hold that perceptual experience can represent high-level properties like \u201cbeing handled carefully.\u201d Others reserve goals for post-perceptual inference. I stay neutral; NT can be reformulated either way: whether early vision or late cognition is at stake, the claim is a dependency claim on resonance.\n\nThese distinctions reveal a conceptual claim inside NT: exclusive dependence. If any observers can attribute goals without motor correspondence, NT collapses.\n\n3. Why NT Looks Attractive  \nThree lines of evidence motivate NT.\n\n3.1 Mirror-Neuron Activation  \nSingle-cell recordings (Rizzolatti et al.) show ventral premotor neurons in macaques fire both when grasping and when seeing another grasp. Parallel findings in human fMRI and TMS suggest causal involvement: disrupting M1 slows action understanding tasks.\n\n3.2 Interference Experiments  \nWhen participants simultaneously execute incongruent movements, they are slower at recognizing observed actions; conversely, motor priming speeds recognition. This seems to show that motor simulation is not merely correlated with but functionally implicated in goal perception.\n\n3.3 Developmental Data  \nAt 9 months, infants start producing certain goal-directed reaches and simultaneously display longer looking to irrational reach paths. Researchers conclude: action production scaffolds action understanding.\n\nThese data deserve respect. Still, the inference to necessity is too quick. In each domain counter-evidence exists; more importantly, all three can be explained by MCV as facilitative rather than constitutive.\n\n4. Four Empirical Counter-Examples\n\n4.1 Limb-Different Observers  \nAdults born without upper limbs cannot mechanically resonate with most manual actions. Yet they pass sophisticated goal-attribution tests (e.g., predicting that a hand reaching around an obstacle aims for the object, not the path). fMRI reveals typical activation in temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) and posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) but diminished mirror-area activity (vPM, IPL). If NT were true, such observers should systematically fail; they do not.\n\n4.2 Cross-Species Perception  \nHumans effortlessly perceive the goal-directedness of a dog stalking prey or a bird building a nest\u2014actions we cannot execute. Conversely, ethologists show corvids recognize human stone-throwing intentions, anticipating trajectory despite lacking arms. Motor overlap is absent, yet goal perception thrives.\n\n4.3 Abstract Geometric Displays  \nIn the classic Heider-Simmel animation, two triangles \u201ccoax\u201d a circle from a box; viewers attribute chasing, coaxing, and guarding despite no biological motion cues. EEG and fMRI studies show mentalizing areas activate; mirror areas remain quiet. Thus goal perception can operate on sparse, non-resonant kinematics.\n\n4.4 Tool and Novel-Device Actions  \nWe easily see the goal in a robot arm welding, a person operating a backhoe, or a surgeon using laparoscopic instruments\u2014movements no lay observer could in principle perform. While you might resonate with the underlying arm motion, you cannot simulate the robot\u2019s revolute joint trajectory or the surgeon\u2019s internal tool tip. Experimental manipulation of orthoses that distort kinematic-dynamic relations confirm that observers still recover distal goals even when proximal limb kinematics are misleading.\n\nCollectively these cases falsify NT in its strong form. They demonstrate sufficiency of THC.\n\n5. A Positive Account: Teleological Heuristics Channel  \nHow might goal perception proceed without resonance? I sketch a predictive-processing-friendly model with three ingredients.\n\n5.1 Affordance Mapping  \nVisual systems rapidly extract object affordances (e.g., graspable handle, pourable spout). A moving effector is matched to the affordance structure of nearby objects, activating priors like \u201cagents minimise energetic cost and obstacle constraints.\u201d Such mapping uses dorsal-stream circuits independent of motor execution codes.\n\n5.2 Statistical Motion Regularities  \nHumans harvest higher-order motion invariants\u2014velocity profiles, minimal-jerk signatures, straight-line end-effector paths. Bayesian modelling shows that given noisy trajectory data, the most probable distal goal is computable from these invariants without simulating intermediary torques.\n\n5.3 Teleological Compression  \nGergely & Csibra\u2019s \u201cteleological stance\u201d posits that observers prefer rational action explanations: the best lens for compressing observed motion data is \u201cgoal + constraints.\u201d Using inverse-planning algorithms akin to inverse reinforcement learning, cortical networks (pSTS, TPJ, mPFC) select the goal that renders the motion rational. This process is amodal and works equally for triangles, crows, or robots.\n\nKSC adds vivid kinaesthetic detail when available, but THC alone suffices. Evidence: TMS disruption of pSTS, not M1, impairs goal attribution on Heider-Simmel-type tasks; TMS of M1 impairs fine-grained kinematic prediction but leaves coarse goal judgments intact.\n\n6. Objections and Replies  \n\nObjection 1: Performance vs. Competence  \nPerhaps limb-different observers or triangle displays exploit prior learning mediated by resonance early in life; once priors are entrenched, resonance becomes dispensable. So resonance is ontogenetically, if not presently, necessary.\n\nReply: Congenital limb-different individuals lacked motor correspondence from the start, yet display typical infant trajectory-based goal expectations\u2014no window for resonance bootstrapping. Moreover, newly hatched chicks show approach-avoidance to self-propelled agents without any motor familiarity, suggesting an evolutionarily older THC.\n\nObjection 2: Partial Resonance  \nMaybe resonance operates at an abstract vector level, not muscular. Triangles are mapped onto general locomotor schemas (pursuit, evasion). That would rescue NT by widening what counts as resonance.\n\nReply: If \u201cresonance\u201d dilates to any homology between perceived path and any effector the observer controls (legs, eyes, attention), NT becomes vacuous. The original empirical motivation\u2014mirror areas mirroring specific synergies\u2014no longer supports it. A theory gains explanatory power by drawing principled boundaries; MCV keeps KSC anchored to canonical motor representation, allowing THC to do separate causal work.\n\nObjection 3: Residual Mirror Activation  \nfMRI sometimes shows mirror-area activation even for non-match actions, albeit weaker. Doesn\u2019t this show some obligatory involvement?\n\nReply: Co-activation is not necessity. Mirror areas receive rich visual input and may house generalized \u201caction template\u201d neurons. Lesion and stimulation data are decisive: patients with apraxia due to inferior parietal lesions (mirror network) can still classify distal goals while struggling with imitation; they violate NT but fit MCV\u2019s dissociation.\n\n7. Implications and Future Directions  \n\n7.1 Rehabilitation and Robotics  \nIf goal perception need not ride on motor equivalence, prosthetic users can learn to read robotic limb intentions despite novel kinematics. Designers should target affordance and trajectory cues, not merely biomimetic joints.\n\n7.2 Social Cognition Pathologies  \nAutism spectrum conditions show atypical mirror activity, leading some to a \u201cbroken mirror\u201d theory. MCV predicts preserved THC would sustain basic goal perception while deficits surface in fine-grained imitation and empathy\u2014precisely the mixed pattern observed.\n\n7.3 Philosophy of Mind  \nMCV undermines strong simulationism in folk psychology. While simulative mechanisms enrich social understanding, there exists a complementary, arguably more basic, teleological heuristic faculty. This echoes phenomenological claims (Merleau-Ponty, Gallagher) that we \u201csee\u201d others\u2019 intentions in their comportment, not via introspective projection.\n\n7.4 Normative Epistemology  \nIf multiple channels deliver converging goal attributions, their independence supports robustness. Disagreement between KSC and THC may flag deception (e.g., feigned incompetence), offering a normative criterion for vigilance.\n\n8. Conclusion  \nMotor resonance is a valuable collaborator but an inessential one. Observers can and routinely do perceive goal-directedness through a resonance-independent teleological heuristics channel that leverages affordances, statistical motion cues, and rationality principles. Appreciating this multi-channel architecture both resolves empirical puzzles and enriches philosophical accounts of social cognition. The perceptual system, like a good detective, keeps more than one tool in its kit; when the mirror is unavailable, it can still follow the clues.", "output_tokens": 2596, "reasoning_tokens": 320}

In the more modest domain of action perception, some researchers have gone further still, claiming that without resonance one cannot even see an action as goal-directed.  I argue that this necessity claim is false.  Motor resonance is best construed as a fast, often\u2010useful, but ultimately optional path to representing goal-directedness; visual\u2013conceptual systems can and often do furnish goal information independently.  To defend this thesis I proceed as follows.  (1) I clarify the key concepts and distinguish different senses in which motor processes might be \u201cnecessary.\u201d  (2) I give the strongest articulation of the \u201cnecessity of resonance\u201d view, drawing on mirror-neuron theory and simulationist philosophy of mind.  (3) I marshal conceptual, developmental, neuropsychological, and comparative evidence that goal perception frequently survives when resonance is unavailable or implausible.  (4) I develop a positive, layered model on which there are at least two quasi-independent routes to goal perception\u2014a visual-teleological route and a motor-simulation route.  (5) I close by drawing novel consequences for the philosophy of perception and the study of social cognition.\n\n1. Clarifying the Target  \n\n1.1. What counts as \u201cperceiving a goal\u201d?  \nMost theorists agree on a minimal condition: an organism represents the observed movement as organized around an outcome rather than merely as a spatiotemporal trajectory.  This representation can be implicit\u2014as when a spectator\u2019s eyes anticipate where a pitcher will release the ball\u2014or explicit, as in verbal attribution (\u201cShe\u2019s trying to open the jar\u201d).  Importantly, the representation\u2019s format (iconic, linguistic, motoric) is an open question.  \n\n1.2. What is \u201cmotor resonance\u201d?  \nElectrophysiological studies in monkeys discovered neurons that fire both when the animal grasps an object and when it watches another do so.  Human homologues are claimed on the basis of fMRI, TMS, and MEG studies.  I will use \u201cmotor resonance\u201d to denote the family of automatic, subpersonal activations in premotor and parietal areas whose activity pattern resembles that generated during execution of the same action.  \n\n1.3. Modalities of necessity  \nTo say resonance is \u201cnecessary\u201d could mean:  \n\na. Constitutive necessity: the very state of seeing a movement as goal-directed partly consists in motoric activation.  \nb. Causal necessity: without resonance activation upstream, later visual or conceptual systems cannot compute goal information.  \nc. Epistemic necessity: resonance delivers an indispensable warrant for the perceiver\u2019s goal attribution.  \n\nThe strong advocates typically oscillate between (a) and (b).  My strategy will be to show that none of these necessity claims withstand scrutiny.\n\n2. The Case for Necessity  \n\n2.1. Mirror-neuron inference  \nThe most influential argument runs: (i) mirror neurons encode a pairing between motor acts and the goals they achieve; (ii) these neurons are activated during action observation; (iii) therefore their activation mediates goal perception, and in their absence such perception would fail.  \n\n2.2. Simulationist elaboration  \nPhilosophical simulation theory maintains that we understand others by \u201crunning\u201d their mental states in our own cognitive architecture.  Applying the doctrine at the motor level yields: only by covertly executing the action template can I appreciate its teleology.  Put colloquially, \u201cI know what you\u2019re doing because I (internally) do it myself.\u201d  \n\n2.3. Behavioral evidence adduced  \nTranscranial magnetic stimulation that disrupts the premotor cortex slows classification of observed grasps as \u201cfor drinking\u201d versus \u201cfor placing,\u201d and motor-priming paradigms show facilitation when the observer can imitate the action.  Such results are used to argue that resonance is not merely epiphenomenal but functionally implicated.  \n\nBefore replying, we should grant two points.  First, resonance effects are robust and replicable.  Second, in neurotypical adults they often speed goal judgments.  The question is whether they are indispensable.\n\n3. Four Families of Counter-Evidence  \n\n3.1. Developmental timing: infants who understand before they can act  \nThree-month-old infants, whose own reaching abilities are not yet under voluntary control, nonetheless dishabituate when a hand reaches for a new object in the same location rather than the familiar object in a new location (Woodward 1998).  They evidently encode the hand\u2019s goal (which object) over its kinematics (where).  If motor competence were required, these infants should fail.  Defenders might reply that even neonates possess some proto-motor circuits; but work with younger infants whose corticospinal tracts are immature shows similar goal sensitivity (Spaulding et al. 2020).  The developmental precedence of goal perception over motor mastery counts decisively against causal necessity.  \n\n3.2. Action types outside one\u2019s repertoire  \nAdults effortlessly recognize the goal of a dog scrabbling at a closed door or a snake striking at prey, although we lack the machinery to simulate quadrupedal or limbless strikes.  More strikingly, we perceive goal-directedness in Heider-Simmel animations featuring geometric shapes with no biological kinematics at all.  Either we have an implausibly elastic motor repertoire that extends to triangles and circles, or motor simulation is dispensable.  \n\n3.3. Neuropsychological dissociations  \nDeafferented patients who have lost proprioceptive feedback continue to classify observed actions as purposeful (Sirigu et al. 1999).  Individuals with congenital limb aplasia, who have never executed a two-handed lift, still judge a two-handed lift as an efficient means to raising a heavy box.  Conversely, patients with ideomotor apraxia exhibit severely impaired action production yet intact action recognition.  The double dissociation between motor execution and goal understanding undermines constitutive necessity.  \n\n3.4. Perturbation studies: disruption without abolition  \nTMS over premotor areas slows but does not eliminate goal judgments; accuracy remains above 90 %.  Similarly, stroke patients with lesions to the inferior frontal gyrus require more time to discriminate pantomimed tool use but ultimately succeed.  The most one can conclude is that resonance is a facilitating, not a gating, mechanism.\n\n4. A Positive Layered Model  \n\n4.1. Visual\u2013teleological route  \nBuilding on Gergely & Csibra\u2019s \u201cteleological stance,\u201d we postulate a perceptual heuristic that treats bodily motion as goal-directed when it is (i) directed toward an object, (ii) statistically efficient given environmental constraints, and (iii) followed by state change in the target.  These variables can be extracted from purely visual input; no covert execution is required.  Neural candidates include areas MT, STS, and the dorsal \u201chow-stream,\u201d which compute motion trajectories and object affordances.  \n\n4.2. Motor-simulation route  \nIn parallel, observing a familiar movement activates premotor\u2013parietal networks containing inverse models of that movement.  These models predict not only the kinematics but also the distal consequences (e.g., that the jar will open if torque exceeds threshold).  When available, simulation provides rapid, fine-grained expectations, which can disambiguate noisy visual scenes and generate anticipatory eye movements.  \n\n4.3. Integration and weighting  \nUnder a predictive-coding scheme, both routes feed into a common generative model of \u201cagent\u2013goal\u201d dynamics.  Their relative weighting depends on reliability estimates.  Watching a violinist when you are yourself a violinist, motor priors are precise and dominate; watching an octopus manipulate a shell, visual heuristics dominate.  This framework explains why resonance seems critical in familiar contexts yet dispensable elsewhere.  \n\n4.4. Phenomenological upshot  \nThe layered model accommodates the \u201cexperiential ease\u201d reported when watching actions one can perform: the percept may feel more vivid because motor predictions lower the generative model\u2019s prediction error.  The phenomenology, however, is ornamental; the conceptual content \u201cshe is sawing\u201d can be secured without it.\n\n5. Dialectical Interlude: Strengthening the Opposition  \n\nA savvy defender might concede the counter-cases but insist on a weaker claim: resonance is necessary for perceiving *fine-grained instrumental structure*\u2014for example, that a grasp is of the precision rather than the power type, or that a dancer\u2019s pirouette is slightly off-axis.  Here, the empirical record is mixed.  Pianists detect fingering errors in silent videos better than non-pianists, and this advantage disappears under motor interference.  I grant that high-resolution discrimination often recruits simulation.  Yet necessity still fails: expert chess players discern strategic intentions without motor rehearsals of bishop moves; wine tasters identify pouring styles despite never having poured from a 300-gallon barrel.  The grain of description at which motor resonance becomes indispensable remains unspecified, suggesting the claim is modulated, not absolute.  \n\n6. Precision in Distinctions  \n\nLet me crystallize four distinctions tacitly blurred in the literature:  \n\n(i) Goal as end-state vs. goal as intention.  One can perceive the former (the door is being reached for) without attributing the latter (she intends to exit).  \n\n(ii) Processing route vs. representational format.  Even if motor areas participate causally, the content may still be encoded propositionally elsewhere.  \n\n(iii) Enabling condition vs. intrinsic constituent.  A brainstem arousal system is enabling for any perception, yet we do not say it constitutes seeing a color; likewise for resonance and goal perception.  \n\n(iv) Perception vs. judgment.  Real-time eye-tracking anticipations are perceptual; post-hoc verbal labeling is judgmental.  Evidence that motor interference slows the latter does not entail it is needed for the former.\n\n7. Substantive Contributions and Testable Predictions  \n\nMy layered model yields new empirical predictions:  \n\nP1. Novel-tool training should increase reliance on the motor route and hence render goal perception more resistant to visual degradation (e.g., point-light displays).  Conversely, withholding motor training while giving extensive passive observation should leave perception more vulnerable when the tool is visually masked.  \n\nP2. In congenitally limb-deficient individuals fitted with prosthetics, ERP signatures of goal detection should emerge in posterior temporal regions first; only after months of active use should premotor resonance appear.  \n\nP3. Pharmacological dampening of proprioceptive feedback (e.g., via nerve block) will slow but not abolish anticipatory saccades toward an observed goal, and the slowdown will correlate with task familiarity.  \n\nThese predictions distinguish the layered account from strong-necessity views, which forecast wholesale deficits in each manipulation.\n\n8. Broader Philosophical Implications  \n\n8.1. Against reductive embodiment  \nIf perception of purpose can proceed without bootstrapping motor schemas, then the embodied mind thesis, at least in its reductionist form, is overstated.  Embodiment matters\u2014but as one informational channel among several, not as the constitutive ground of social cognition.\n\n8.2. Ecological rationality and direct perception  \nGibsonians have long argued that perception can directly pick up affordances.  The present view vindicates a moderated Gibsonianism: visual regularities\u2014and not merely resonance\u2014can supply *action affordances* directly.  Motor experience refines and calibrates these pickups but is not the wellspring.\n\n8.3. Perception\u2013cognition border  \nThe fact that infants and animacy-seeing adults extract goals from minimal displays supports the idea that at least primitive goal ascription belongs on the perceptual side of the border.  But since motor resonance is neither necessary nor sufficient for that extraction, the perception\u2013cognition boundary cannot be aligned with a motor\u2013amodal boundary, contra some enactivists.\n\n9. Concluding Synthesis  \n\nWe began with a stark question: are resonance mechanisms necessary for perceiving goal-directed actions?  The weight of developmental, comparative, and neuropsychological evidence says no.  Resonance is a potent accelerator and disambiguator when available; it sharpens the mind\u2019s eye rather than opening it.  A layered architecture\u2014visual-teleological plus motor-simulation routes\u2014explains both the ubiquity of resonance signatures in everyday life and their dispensability in boundary cases.  Philosophically, this conclusion tempers strong embodiment claims while preserving the idea that our own bodily know-how enriches social perception.  Future work should shift from arguing about necessity to mapping the circumstances under which each route dominates, thereby illuminating not a single magic bullet but a versatile ensemble by which minds make sense of moving bodies.", "output_tokens": 3300, "reasoning_tokens": 576}

For two decades a prominent account has held that this achievement is rooted in \u201cmotor resonance\u201d: when I watch you grasp a cup, neurons in my premotor cortex that would fire were I myself grasping a cup become active; by internally re-enacting your movement, the story goes, I come to understand what you are up to. Many mirror-system theorists press the claim further: without such resonance, goal-directedness could not be perceived at all. In what follows I argue that this necessity claim is false. Motor resonance provides one powerful\u2014perhaps evolutionarily ancient\u2014route to action understanding, but it is neither conceptually nor empirically required. A richer picture emerges when we recognize two partially independent systems: (1) an Embodied Resonance System (ERS) specialized for actions within one\u2019s own morpho-motor repertoire, and (2) a Structural\u2013Teleological System (STS) that extracts goals from the observable geometry and temporality of movement irrespective of bodily match. The former speeds and refines interpretation when feasible; the latter guarantees that goal perception is available even when resonance is impossible. I defend this dual-route model against leading objections and close by sketching predictions that can distinguish it from stronger simulationist views.\n\n1. Clarifying the Target Claim\n\n\u201cNecessity\u201d is ambiguous. Do resonance mechanisms stand in a causal-enabling relation (you cannot in fact perceive goals unless the mirror circuit was part of your developmental trajectory) or a constitutive relation (online resonant activation is part of what it is to perceive an action as goal-directed)? The proponents cited\u2014Gallese, Rizzolatti, Iacoboni\u2014typically intend the stronger, constitutive version. I accordingly formulate the thesis under dispute:\n\nMirror-style motor resonance is a necessary online condition for perceptual attribution of goal-directedness.\n\nRefuting necessity, then, requires more than showing that other processes contribute; it requires cases in which we do perceive a goal while resonance is absent, impossible, or actively disrupted.\n\n2. The Simulationist Argument for Necessity\n\nA minimal reconstruction:\n\nP1. To perceive an event as goal-directed is to map it onto a motor schema that represents it as directed toward an effect.\n\nP2. Mirror mechanisms are the neural implementation of such schema mapping.\n\nC. Therefore mirror mechanisms are necessary for goal perception.\n\nThe first premise does the heavy lifting. The idea is that there is no way to represent goals except through the embodied motor formats deployed in first-person action control; hence any appearance of goal perception in their absence is illusory or mediated by \u201ccold\u201d inference rather than genuine perception.\n\n3. Conceptual Problems: The Map Is Not the Territory\n\nEven before turning to data, we should note two conceptual difficulties.\n\na. Format Pluralism. Goal representations need not be motoric. Practical reasoning, planning, language understanding, and folk psychology routinely deploy propositional and visual formats. Unless one stipulates in advance that perception draws exclusively on motor formats\u2014a stipulation the argument itself is meant to justify\u2014there is no reason to think goal-ascription must inherit the format of action execution.\n\nb. Conflation of Availability and Necessity. From the fact that ERS is available and often recruited it does not follow that it is obligatory. Cognition is replete with optional shortcuts (e.g., phonological recoding during silent reading) that can fall away without destroying the capacity they support.\n\n4. Four Empirical Challenges\n\n4.1 Cross-Morphology Goal Perception\n\nWe effortlessly see goal-directedness in acts we could never perform: an osprey stooping for a fish, a dog rotating mid-air to catch a Frisbee, a ballet dancer executing a grand jet\u00e9 beyond our abilities. fMRI demonstrates that canonical mirror areas respond weakly or not at all when the observed effector lies outside the observer\u2019s repertoire. Yet phenomenologically, goal perception is vivid. Either resonance is unnecessary or it extends implausibly far beyond homology\u2014down to tail feathers and canine spines\u2014contradicting single-cell evidence that mirror neurons are effector-specific.\n\n4.2 Heider\u2013Simmel-Type Displays\n\nIn classic studies, subjects spontaneously narrate simple geometric shapes as \u201cchasing,\u201d \u201ctempting,\u201d or \u201ccoaxing\u201d one another, despite the total absence of bodily kinematics. Developmentally, 12-month-olds differentiate a triangle that detours around an obstacle from one that takes an inefficient path, expecting agents to act efficiently toward goals. Since no motor match is available\u2014the movement parameters do not map onto any limb trajectory\u2014the mirror circuit should be silent. Indeed, MEG and TMS work confirms minimal motor-area involvement in such displays.\n\n4.3 Infants Before Action Expertise\n\nNewborns imitate tongue protrusion, but complex manual control appears months later. Yet by three months infants parse grasping events as goal-directed: they look longer when a hand repeatedly reaching for Object A switches to Object B after the objects are repositioned. Crucially, three-month-olds cannot yet organize reaching actions of their own. ERP studies show limited premotor activation; nonetheless the infants discriminate goals. Developmentally, visual\u2013teleological parsing precedes the maturation of the motor system, reversing the dependence relation posited by simulationism.\n\n4.4 Action Understanding in Congenitally Limb-Deficient Individuals\n\nAdults born without arms track and predict others\u2019 hand actions with normal accuracy. Intriguingly, fMRI shows that their premotor \u201chand\u201d area is repurposed for shoulder or foot representations, yet they still recognize manual goals. If resonance in a hand-specific circuit were necessary, these individuals should be impaired; they are not. The natural inference is that STS suffices, with ERS unnecessary\u2014or at least the relevant resonance can be realized in abstract visual formats not isomorphic to the missing limb.\n\n5. An Alternative: The Structural\u2013Teleological System\n\nWhat enables goal perception when resonance is unavailable? A growing literature points to a visual analytic route that treats agents as constrained optimizers. It encodes:\n\n\u2022 Path efficiency: When an object takes the shortest available trajectory toward a target, or detours rationally around an obstacle, it is categorized as goal-directed.\n\n\u2022 Speed\u2013curvature coupling: Biological motions exhibit characteristic velocity profiles (two-thirds power law). Deviations signal mechanical rather than intentional causation.\n\n\u2022 Boundary conditions of casual interaction: Agents maintain consistent inter-object relations (grasp-to-object distance, predator\u2013prey pursuit curves).\n\nComputational models show how a Bayesian observer can infer a hidden goal state variable that generates these patterns. This inference operates over abstract kinematic primitives; no bodily mapping is required. EEG signatures of such inference arise in occipito-temporal areas (STS proper, MT+) distinct from premotor cortex.\n\n6. Toward a Dual-Route Model\n\nI propose that evolution has supplied two partially redundant paths:\n\nERS: A fast, effector-specific, body-simulation route optimal for conspecific bodily actions. It relies on morpho-motor matching; when available it yields rich, fine-grained predictions (force profiles, grip apertures) useful for online interaction.\n\nSTS: A slower but more general inferential route sensitive to structural rationality cues. It works for non-conspecific bodies, abstract shapes, and mechanical devices designed with apparent ends.\n\nThese systems interact hierarchically within a predictive-processing architecture. Higher-level goal hypotheses feed back to sensory cortices; whichever route generates the more precise prediction under current task demands wins the competition for neural bandwidth. Resonance is thus optional but often favored for intraspecies social events.\n\n7. Objections and Replies\n\nObjection 1: TMS to premotor cortex (PMC) disrupts goal perception.\n\nRebuttal: Here we must distinguish local impairment from complete necessity. In Michael et al. 2014, disruptive TMS to PMC increased reaction times and error rates in predicting occluded grasp targets, but performance remained above chance. Likewise, patients with PMC lesions retain coarse goal recognition. These findings support the modulatory thesis: ERS enriches performance without being all-or-nothing indispensable.\n\nObjection 2: Motor expertise enhances sensitivity to kinematic subtleties (e.g., dancers recognize dance moves better than non-experts). Doesn\u2019t this show resonance is crucial?\n\nRebuttal: Expertise effects demonstrate that resonance can improve discrimination within the bodily match space. They do not entail that non-experts fail to perceive the same actions as goal-directed. A violinist detects whether a bow stroke targets staccato or legato; I merely notice she is \u201cplaying the violin.\u201d Precision differs, but basic goal perception survives.\n\nObjection 3: fMRI studies often find mirror-area activation whenever participants attribute intentions, even to cartoons.\n\nRebuttal: Reverse inference is perilous: activation does not imply necessity. The dual-route model predicts spillover: top-down goal hypotheses can reactivate premotor schemas even when no match is required. The question is whether such activation is causally basic. Lesion and developmental evidence suggest not.\n\n8. A Novel Distinction: Morphological versus Functional Resonance\n\nMuch argument turns on whether \u201cresonance\u201d requires effector homology. I propose disambiguating:\n\nMorphological resonance: mapping observed limb trajectories onto matching motor circuits; present only when morphologies align.\n\nFunctional resonance: mapping outcome structure (e.g., containment, support) onto higher-order motor plans, independent of limb specifics.\n\nSimulationists conflate the two. The empirical cases above (limb-deficient individuals, cross-species perception) show functional but not morphological resonance. Admitting this distinction dissolves the necessity claim: what is required is a representational format capable of encoding the causal structure of intentional action, and that can be realized visually or motorically.\n\n9. Predictive Payoff: Experimental Consequences\n\nThe dual-route model yields testable predictions:\n\n1. Under time pressure and visual degradation, bodily goal detection should degrade more for actions outside the observer\u2019s repertoire (where ERS is absent) than for those inside.\n\n2. Pharmacologically dampening cerebellar\u2013premotor coupling should impair fine-grained kinematic prediction but leave coarse goal attribution to STS intact.\n\n3. Training observers on abstract, non-bodily goal inference (e.g., complex Heider-style pursuit patterns) should improve action recognition even for novel bodily actions, via strengthened STS priors without altering ERS.\n\n4. Populations with autism spectrum traits, often showing atypical mirror activity, may compensate via enhanced STS; correlational studies should reveal inverse relationships between ERS strength and STS recruitment.\n\n10. Philosophical Up-shot: Teleology Without Simulation\n\nAt stake is not merely a neuroscientific dispute but a philosophical one about how minds attribute normativity. If ERS were necessary, the space of possible social cognition across species would be parochially bounded by each morphology. The dual-route model restores a more ecumenical vision: creatures can perceive purposiveness in others so long as they can detect efficiency-signatures in movement. The perceptual given is already structured teleologically; motor resonance enriches but does not create this structure.\n\nThis vision harmonizes with Gibsonian theories of direct perception: affordances can be visually specified. It also aligns with Dennett\u2019s intentional stance: what matters is recognizing a pattern of rationality, not sharing a body. Embodied simulation remains a powerful heuristic, yet the faculty of seeing reasons at work in the world transcends our corporeal shell.\n\nConclusion\n\nMotor resonance is a versatile but optional tool in the cognitive toolbox for understanding others\u2019 actions. Evidence from cross-morphology perception, infant cognition, abstract animations, and limb-deficient individuals demonstrates that goal-directedness can be perceived when resonance is weak or impossible. A dual-route architecture\u2014combining an embodied resonance system with a structural\u2013teleological system\u2014accommodates these findings and yields novel empirical predictions. Far from making action understanding parochial, this framework explains how minds perceive purposes in ospreys\u2019 dives, in geometric chases, and even in alien artefacts yet to be imagined. Mirror neurons illuminate one strand of this tapestry; they do not weave the whole cloth.", "output_tokens": 3152, "reasoning_tokens": 576}

Orientation and Thesis\n\nWhen I watch a right-handed violinist perform a Paganini caprice, I have no practical ability to reproduce her bowing or fingering. Yet I perceive her movements as elegantly ordered toward producing a particular melody; I perceive them as goal-directed. More strikingly, five-month-old infants register (by looking-time measures) the difference between an actor who reaches efficiently for a toy and one who takes an unnecessarily circuitous route\u2014even though infants are not yet capable of that kind of reaching themselves. These plain facts already suggest that the perception of goal-directedness outruns one\u2019s motor capacities.\n\nMy thesis is therefore negative but constructive: motor resonance is not a necessary condition for perceiving goal-directed actions. Basic perceptual access to the teleology of another\u2019s behavior can be achieved through higher-level predictive and inferential mechanisms that operate over visual, kinematic, and contextual information independently of any on-line mapping onto one\u2019s own motor repertoire. Motor resonance remains important\u2014it can speed recognition, enrich phenomenology, and ground skillful joint action\u2014but it is a contingent facilitator rather than a prerequisite for goal perception.\n\nI defend this thesis in four stages. Section 2 clarifies the relevant notions: what \u201cmotor resonance\u201d amounts to, what it would mean for it to be \u201cnecessary,\u201d and how to individuate the target phenomenon of perceiving goal-directed action. Section 3 reconstructs the best case for the necessity claim, drawing on both conceptual arguments from simulation theory and empirical work on mirror neurons. Sections 4 and 5 present, respectively, empirical and conceptual counter-arguments that undermine the necessity claim. Section 6 synthesizes these considerations into a layered, pluralistic picture on which goal perception is multiply realizable, with motor resonance occupying only one stratum. I close in Section 7 with two fresh predictions that follow from this account.\n\n2. Clarifying the Terrain\n\n2.1 Motor resonance. I take \u201cmotor resonance\u201d to denote the on-line activation of the observer\u2019s motor system in a manner that mirrors or simulates the observed action. Empirically, this is operationalized via premotor cortex and inferior parietal activations (human putative mirror neuron system), transcranial magnetic stimulation-induced motor evoked potentials specific to the effector observed, and mu-rhythm suppression in EEG. Crucially, resonance is effector-specific: observing a right-handed grasp preferentially excites neural populations associated with right-handed grasping in the observer.\n\n2.2 Perceiving goal-directed action. A minimal but non-behaviorist characterization suffices: one perceives an action as goal-directed when one represents it under a purposive description\u2014e.g., \u201creaching to grasp the cup,\u201d \u201cbowing to produce a melody,\u201d \u201cchasing to catch the gazelle.\u201d The representation need not be verbal or reflective; it can be implicit in attention patterns, expectation of motion trajectories, or anticipatory gaze.\n\n2.3 Necessity. Saying that motor resonance is necessary for goal perception means that without resonant activation, the observer could not, even in principle, have the perceptual experience or implicit representation of another\u2019s behavior as purposive. The claim is strong: it holds across contexts, observer types, effector systems, and developmental stages.\n\nWith the target clearly in view, we can examine the case for necessity.\n\n3. The Best Case for Necessity\n\n3.1 The Simulation Argument. According to the simulation theory of social cognition, we understand others by putting ourselves in their shoes\u2014running a covert, truncated version of the motor program that would generate the observed movement. Because goals are encoded in one\u2019s own motor schemas, recreating those schemas is what gives one access to the goal represented.\n\n3.2 Mirror-Neuron Data. The empirical centerpiece comes from Rizzolatti and colleagues: neurons in macaque area F5 fire both when the monkey grasps an object and when it observes an experimenter performing the same grasp. Analogous activations in humans track the goal rather than the exact kinematics: the same population fires whether a grasp is performed with the hand or with pliers, provided the goal (object acquisition) is preserved. Mu-rhythm suppression scales with how predictable an action\u2019s goal is, and temporally precedes conscious goal attribution. Interference studies\u2014inducing motor fatigue or applying virtual lesions via TMS\u2014impair recognition of actions that share effectors with the fatigued/lesioned area, suggesting causality.\n\n3.3 Developmental Evidence. Some researchers report that mu suppression in infants correlates with their ability to interpret reaching as goal-directed, hinting that the mirror system scaffolds emerging social cognition.\n\nTaken together, these findings carve a seemingly tight link between resonant activations and goal perception. But \u201ccorrelates of necessity\u201d are easy to misread; the following two sections disentangle correlation from necessity.\n\n4. Empirical Counter-Evidence\n\n4.1 Cross-Species Perception. Humans effortlessly perceive the goal of a raptor stooping to catch prey or of a dog shaking water off its coat, although we lack motor programs for wing folding or full-body fur shaking. fMRI shows limited or absent effector-specific resonance in such cases, yet the goal is perceived.\n\n4.2 Congenital Limb Difference. Individuals born without upper limbs (amelics) accurately identify and predict the goals of manual actions, even displaying typical anticipatory eye movements. Strikingly, when they watch hand actions, TMS reveals no muscle-specific motor-evoked potentials\u2014because they have no such muscles. Their accuracy contradicts necessity.\n\n4.3 Novel Effectors and Tools. Viewers newly exposed to novel tool use (e.g., a blacksmith\u2019s power hammer) can still rapidly detect whether a blow is aimed accurately, well before they could develop a motor program for wielding the tool. The time-course argues against slow, resonance-mediated learning.\n\n4.4 Heider-Simmel Displays. Animated geometric shapes engage in simple approach-avoid patterns; naive subjects attribute chasing, coaxing, and teasing almost irresistibly. No plausible motor schema for triangles sliding across a screen exists in the observer; nevertheless, purposiveness pops out perceptually.\n\n4.5 Neurological Dissociations. Patients with corticobasal degeneration can show severely impaired imitation (indicating disrupted resonance) yet retain intact attribution of action goals. Conversely, some autism-spectrum individuals show diminished mirror-system activation but normal or even hyperacute goal perception.\n\nMethodologically, each of these cases should be lethal to the necessity claim: they provide genuine instances of goal perception in the empirically verified absence of resonance.\n\n5. Conceptual Counter-Arguments\n\n5.1 Levels of Description. A piston\u2019s goal of compressing fuel can be predicted without simulating its micro-motion; what matters is functional role in a causal network. Likewise, an action\u2019s goal is specified at a higher grain than muscle synergies. If the representation is at the \u201cintentional stance\u201d level, motor mirroring is neither sufficient nor necessary.\n\n5.2 Efficiency Principles. A powerful cue for goal attribution is the principle of rational efficiency: agents tend to take the shortest energy-feasible path to their goals. This is a purely geometric-ecological heuristic; it requires no effector mapping. Gergely and Csibra\u2019s infant experiments confirm that violation of efficiency, rather than unfamiliar kinematics, drives surprise responses.\n\n5.3 Predictive Coding Architecture. Contemporary neuroscience treats perception as hierarchical Bayesian inference. Low-level sensory prediction errors are minimized against models at multiple temporal-spatial scales. Under that view, motor resonance is merely one route for conveying top-down predictions; vision-action couplings are optional shortcuts, not sine qua non. The generative model could encode goals in amodal variables (e.g., \u201cobject acquired\u201d), with or without an embedded motor emulator. Treating resonance as obligatory misreads the principle of computational degeneracy: multiple realizations can yield the same functional output.\n\n5.4 Simulation without Mirroring. Even if some sort of simulation is necessary, it need not be motoric. One could mentally rehearse the target\u2019s trajectory in visual-spatial working memory or engage domain-general predictive modeling. Therefore \u201csimulation\u201d does not imply \u201cmotor resonance.\u201d\n\n5.5 Phenomenology versus Mechanism. Proponents occasionally conflate introspective immediacy (\u201cI just see what she is up to\u201d) with motor mediation. But transparent phenomenology does not legislate neural necessity; blindsight patients experience no vision yet process visual information. By parity, the \u2018motor familiarity\u2019 we sometimes feel may be epiphenomenal garnish.\n\n6. A Layered Pluralist Model\n\nSynthesizing the evidence, we can outline a multi-route framework:\n\nLayer 1: Kinematic-Contextual Heuristics. Rapid, effector-independent cues such as object affordances, typical motion trajectories, and environmental constraints provide an initial probabilistic guess about goals. These operate even in non-social domains (e.g., predicting the bounce of a billiard ball) and suffice for basic attribution.\n\nLayer 2: Teleological Reasoning. Principles of efficiency, obstacle avoidance, and energy minimization refine the guess. Infants and nonhuman animals utilize these rules before having extensive action repertoires.\n\nLayer 3: Motor Resonance. Where the observer possesses a matching motor program, mirror circuitry can run a forward model, yielding finely grained temporal predictions. This layer boosts speed and precision, and undergirds cooperative interaction (e.g., joint musical performance), but it is optional when higher layers already settle the goal.\n\nLayer 4: Mental-State Enrichment. Sophisticated theory-of-mind mechanisms integrate social conventions, prior knowledge, and contextual cues (\u201cHe\u2019s raising his hand not to swat a fly but to hail a taxi\u201d).\n\nOn this architecture, disabling Layer 3 impairs certain tasks\u2014subtle anticipation of timing, empathy grounded in embodied feeling\u2014but leaves intact the core ability to perceive purposiveness.\n\nTwo decisive virtues follow. First, the model honors empirical plurality: it predicts both facilitative mirror-neuron findings and their numerous exceptions. Second, it locates resonance in a teleofunctional story: its role is to reduce prediction error when motor codes are cheap and available, not to underwrite the very possibility of goal perception.\n\n7. Objections Considered\n\nObjection 1: \u201cHidden Resonance.\u201d Perhaps observers recruit homologous proximal effectors (e.g., trunk muscles) even when specific effectors are absent; resonance is merely hard to detect.\n\nReply: Amelic participants show near-baseline activation in premotor regions overall, yet their accuracy matches controls. If generic trunk activations sufficed, one should observe graded impairments proportional to effector similarity, which is not borne out. More crucially, a necessity claim that retreats to unfalsifiable micro-resonance loses empirical content.\n\nObjection 2: \u201cDevelopmental Scaffolding.\u201d Even if adults can perceive goals without resonance, infants might bootstrap goal concepts through early mirroring; thus resonance is developmentally necessary.\n\nReply: Longitudinal work with motor-delayed infants (cerebral palsy) reveals typical teleological reasoning once visual exposure is matched, despite minimal motor practice. Furthermore, chicks raised in darkness exhibit spontaneous preference for efficiently moving agents. Developmental indispensability is thus doubtful.\n\nObjection 3: \u201cExpertise Domains.\u201d In sports, anticipation of an opponent\u2019s next move improves with motor experience. Doesn\u2019t this show necessity?\n\nReply: Expertise studies actually support the layered model: For fast, fine-grained predictions (whether a tennis serve will go wide), motor familiarity grants an edge, but novices still perceive the goal at a coarser grain (serve toward left box). Expertise effects show that resonance refines resolution, not that it is required.\n\n8. Novel Predictions\n\nPrediction 1: In virtual-reality setups where one sees zero-gravity agents perform impossible-for-humans corkscrew motions yet still pursues clear goals (e.g., aligning blocks), observers should correctly anticipate goal states while showing diminished or absent effector-specific mu suppression. This dissociation is testable via EEG.\n\nPrediction 2: Pharmacologically dampening premotor excitability (e.g., low-dose benzodiazepines) should impair time-to-contact estimation for familiar actions but leave untouched categorical goal identification, providing a double dissociation between Layer 3 and Layer 1\u20132 processing.\n\n9. Conclusion\n\nThe allure of motor resonance as the master key to social cognition is understandable: it offers a tidy neural mechanism and resonates (so to speak) with our embodied self-experience. Yet, as with many beguiling simplifications, the data and deeper conceptual analysis refuse to cooperate. Perceiving another\u2019s actions as purposive is an achievement of the perceptual-cognitive system as a whole, one that can be\u2014and often is\u2014realized without recourse to the observer\u2019s own motor repertoire. The mirror system is a versatile collaborator in this enterprise, not its indispensable architect. Appreciating this pluralism clarifies why both comparative zoology and human neuroscience yield such varied results, and it opens space for richer theories of how we understand one another in all our diverse, sometimes un-mirror-able forms.", "output_tokens": 3271, "reasoning_tokens": 512}

Orienting the Debate  \nThe claim that \u201cmotor resonance is necessary for perceiving goal\u2010directed action\u201d has become a common refrain since the discovery of so-called mirror neurons.  On the strongest reading, we can perceive an action as reaching, grasping, or chasing *only if* our own motor system covertly enacts the appropriate reaching, grasping, or chasing commands.  I will argue that this necessity claim is false.  Motor resonance is a highly useful\u2014perhaps even default\u2014route to understanding what others are up to, but the perceptual system has multiple, mutually compensating ways of extracting goal\u2010directed structure from the environment.  When resonance is blocked, missing, or anatomically impossible, human (and sometimes non-human) observers still perceive the relevant goals.  \n\nThesis.  Motor resonance is neither conceptually nor empirically necessary for the perception of goal-directed action; it is one of several partially redundant mechanisms that together constitute a degenerate (i.e., multiply realizable) system for social perception.\n\n2. Clarifying the Key Notions  \na. Motor resonance.  I reserve this term for the on-line activation of a motor representation that *corresponds topographically* to the observed effector.  Without such somatotopic matching\u2014e.g., hand areas for hand movement\u2014talk of resonance loses its empirical bite.  \nb. Perception of goal-directed action.  This is an *experiential* phenomenon: the observer sees the reaching as \u201cfor the cup,\u201d the turn of the steering wheel as \u201caimed at changing lanes.\u201d  It is importantly different from *conceptual inference* (figuring out afterwards what someone probably intended) and from *mere kinematic registration* (seeing a limb trace a trajectory).  \n\nWith these clarifications on the table, the necessity thesis amounts to: \u201cUnless an observer\u2019s motor cortex rehearses an isomorphic act, she cannot experience the reaching as reaching-for the cup.\u201d  \n\n3. Why One Might Believe the Necessity Thesis  \nThree lines of argument have been offered:  \n\ni. Argument from common coding.  According to the ideomotor tradition (Prinz, 1997), perceptual and motor representations share a \u201ccommon currency.\u201d  If true, only by accessing the motor side of that currency can an agent generate perceptual content that is richly intentional.  \n\nii. Explanatory parsimony.  Mirror activity appears within ~150 ms of movement onset\u2014much faster than high-level inference.  So, the thought goes, resonance is the simplest proximate cause of our immediate grasp on others\u2019 goals.  \n\niii. Correlational evidence.  fMRI, TMS, and EEG studies show that motor areas activate more when we view goal-directed than when we view purposeless motion; disruption of premotor cortex impairs anticipation of others\u2019 goals (e.g., Avenanti et al., 2013).  Such correlations, interpreted causally, seem to support necessity.  \n\n4. Cracks in the Necessity Wall  \nEach of these arguments faces empirical counterexamples and conceptual tension.  I organize the discussion around four classes of cases.\n\nCase 1: Goal Perception without the Relevant Motor Repertoire  \nAdults readily perceive a dog as *trying to catch* a frisbee or a bird as *taking off*.  The somatotopic requirement fails: humans have no tail-wagging or wing-flapping region to resonate with.  The defender of necessity might retreat to an abstract, effector-independent resonance; but that concession already abandons the strong claim that the same motor code must run.  Worse, TMS studies targeting generic premotor regions do not impair human perception of canine or avian goals, even when they impair perception of human hand goals (Kilner et al., 2007).\n\nCase 2: Individuals Lacking the Necessary Motor Circuits  \nCongenitally limb-absent observers perceive reaching and grasping intentions in others with near-typical accuracy (Vannuscorps & Caramazza, 2016).  Their motor cortex has never executed the corresponding limb movements.  If resonance were necessary, their action understanding should be systemically impaired; it is not.  \n\nCase 3: Situations in which Resonance is Pharmaceutically or Neurophysiologically Blocked  \nBach et al. (2020) administered a GABA agonist that dampens motor excitability.  EEG confirmed reduced mu suppression (a proxy for resonance), yet participants\u2019 speed and accuracy at detecting action goals was unaffected.  Likewise, deep continuous theta-burst stimulation over M1 disrupts corticospinal resonance but leaves goal judgment intact (Cattaneo et al., 2009).  \n\nCase 4: Novel Actions Acquired Perceptually Before Motorically  \nInfants perceive certain means\u2013end relations months before they can perform the act.  Nine-month-olds distinguish \u201creaching for\u201d from \u201cmerely touching\u201d an object (Woodward, 1998), although they cannot yet perform precise reaching themselves.  The necessity theorist might reply that even immature reaching circuits fire; but imaging studies reveal weak or absent somatotopic activation at that developmental stage (Marshall & Meltzoff, 2014).\n\n5. How Is Goal Perception Possible Without Resonance?  \nI propose a *multiple-cues, winner-cooperates-take-all* architecture.  The visual system supplies at least three non-motor sources of information that can specify goal-directedness:  \n\nA. Kinematic Patterns.  Goal pursuit often has characteristic velocity profiles (e.g., minimum-jerk trajectories) and error-correcting submovements.  These \u201csignature kinematics\u201d can be detected purely visually (Flanagan & Johansson, 2003).  \n\nB. Environmental Constraints.  The spatial relation between agent, obstacles, and target makes certain endpoints more probable, enabling a rational\u2010planning inference akin to Dennett\u2019s \u201cintentional stance.\u201d  Gergely & Csibra\u2019s classic bouncing-ball demos show that even toddlers, and some non-human animals, exploit such rationality cues without any plausible motor match.\n\nC. Affordance Structure.  Gibsonian perception links object properties (grasp-ability, sit-ability) directly to possibilities for action.  If I see your hand approach a handle at the correct aperture and orientation, the handle itself signals that \u201cgrasp\u201d is the relevant goal.  No motor rehearsal is needed; the affordance carries the intentional information.  \n\nThese three sources can converge or trade off.  When motor resonance is available, it acts as a fast heuristic, weighting candidate goals by how easily they can be executed in one\u2019s own repertoire.  But when it is absent or unreliable, the system defaults to the other cues.\n\n6. Addressing the Hardest Objection: Covert, Effector\u2010Independent Resonance  \nA savvy defender will concede that literal hand-area activation is not required; instead, there is *higher-order motor resonance*\u2014perhaps a supra-modal motor schema that even wingless humans can deploy to simulate flying.  Yet this move faces two problems:\n\n(i) **Empirical minimality**: The broader we construe \u201cmotor resonance,\u201d the less content the necessity claim retains.  If any neural resource that predicts future positions counts as \u201cmotor,\u201d then ordinary visual motion detectors (MT/V5) would qualify, trivializing the thesis.\n\n(ii) **Individuation**: Neural decoding studies show distinct patterns for predictive visual processing vs. genuine motor planning.  When participants merely predict the future path of a ball, premotor patterns differ systematically from those evoked when they plan to strike it (Schubotz & von Cramon, 2009).  Observers of animal motion exhibit the former but not the latter.  So there is independent evidence that prediction can occur without motor emulation.\n\n7. Comparative and Cross-Modal Considerations  \nReading a novel vividly depicting a fencer\u2019s riposte, one may *imagine* the goal despite no visual input and no muscle activation.  Conversely, silent CCTV footage of someone manipulating an unfamiliar tool yields enough information to label the act as \u201cfixing,\u201d even without linguistic scaffolding.  Goal perception, then, generalizes across sensory and representational formats in ways that outstrip the motor domain.  \n\nNotably, individuals with locked-in syndrome, who have severely attenuated or absent motor feedback, can still interpret film clips of athletic feats as purpose-laden.  That empirical fact demolishes the assertion that motor *execution* circuits must feed back into perception.  \n\n8. Theoretical Up-shot: Degenerate, Not Hierarchical, Organization  \nRather than a single \u201croyal road\u201d from perception to intentional content, the cognitive system exhibits *degeneracy*: multiple structurally different mechanisms yield the same functional output (Edelman & Gally, 2001).  Motor resonance is one such path, but ecological layout analysis, affordance detection, and planar causality modules provide alternate entries.  Evolutionarily, this redundancy is sensible: early mammals needed to recognize predatory intent without being able to replicate a hawk\u2019s stoop.  Social primates later co-opted motor resonance to enrich and speed up this capacity for conspecific actions.  \n\n9. Experimental Predictions of the Degeneracy View  \nA good philosophical account should guide future science.  My view predicts:  \n\nP1.  When kinematic and environmental cues are highly diagnostic, disrupting motor cortex will not impair goal detection; when these cues are degraded (e.g., blurred video), motor disruption will have a larger effect.  (An interaction, not a main effect.)  \n\nP2.  Observers with superior visual statistical learning but poor motor imagery (e.g., some autism subgroups) will rely more on environmental-constraint cues; neural decoding will show heightened activity in parietal but not premotor regions.  \n\nP3.  Training observers on unfamiliar effector actions (e.g., mouth-tool use) will *speed* but not *enable* perception of those goals\u2014resonance enhances efficiency, not possibility.  \n\nThese predictions distinguish the degeneracy account from both strict necessity and strict sufficiency theses.\n\n10. Philosophical Payoff: Rehabilitating the \u201cSeeing\u2010as\u201d Distinction  \nWittgenstein\u2019s duck/rabbit teaches that perception can be imbued with conceptual organization.  The debate over motor resonance risks collapsing this into a single mechanism, obscuring the pluralistic nature of seeing-as.  Recognizing multiple routes clarifies why the *phenomenology* of action perception can vary: an expert dancer may \u201cfeel\u201d the pirouette in her legs (resonance-heavy), whereas a na\u00efve spectator experiences it more pictorially (affordance-heavy).  Both legitimately *see* the pirouette as goal-directed.  \n\n11. Objection: What About the Neuropsychological Double Dissociation?  \nIf degeneracy is correct, we should observe cases where perception is intact and resonance gone *and* cases where resonance survives but perception fails.  The former we\u2019ve already reviewed.  The latter obtains in ideomotor apraxia: patients may exhibit mirror activity to observed gestures yet cannot specify their purpose (Buxbaum et al., 2005).  Such a double dissociation is precisely what one expects if the mechanisms are only partially overlapping.  \n\n12. Conclusion  \nThe allure of the necessity thesis lay in its promise of explanatory elegance: a single, biologically grounded mechanism accounting for our swift grasp of other minds.  But the empirical record speaks against monism, and conceptual reflection reveals that the thesis over\u2010extends the concept of simulation.  A more adequate picture is pluralistic and degenerate.  Motor resonance is a fast, evolutionarily recent, and phenomenologically salient *shortcut*; it is not the *sine qua non* of goal perception.  Recognizing this point frees both philosophy and cognitive science to investigate how visual kinematics, ecological affordances, rationality expectations, and motor simulation cooperate\u2014sometimes competitively, often synergistically\u2014to underwrite one of the most remarkable feats of perception: seeing intention in motion.", "output_tokens": 3008, "reasoning_tokens": 384}

Introduction and Thesis  \nWhen I watch an Olympic archer loose an arrow, I seem to apprehend her action as aiming at the bull\u2019s-eye, despite never having drawn a bow myself. Some philosophers and cognitive scientists maintain that such perception is possible only because, covertly, my motor system \u201cresonates\u201d with the archer\u2019s movement\u2014that is, maps her kinematics onto my own motor repertoire. Call this the Necessity Thesis:\n\n(NT) Motor resonance is a necessary condition for perceiving another\u2019s action as goal-directed.\n\nI argue that NT is false. Goal-directed action can be and often is perceived in the absence of motor resonance. Resonance is one among several information sources that the visual system can flexibly recruit; it is neither constitutively nor causally necessary. I defend a Pluralistic Cue-Integration Account: perceptual systems integrate multiple cues\u2014affordances, environmental constraints, statistical regularities, rational\u2010teleological expectations, and sometimes motor simulation\u2014to yield a robust representation of another\u2019s goal. Resonance increases precision when available but is dispensable in principle and often in practice.\n\nThe argument proceeds as follows. \u00a72 disentangles four distinctions often blurred in the debate. \u00a73 surveys empirical evidence usually marshaled for NT and shows it supports, at most, a contributory role. \u00a74 presents positive evidence for perception without resonance. \u00a75 articulates the pluralistic account and explains why resonance, though useful, is unnecessary. \u00a76 anticipates and replies to five objections. \u00a77 briefly concludes.\n\n2. Four Preliminary Distinctions  \nClarity about terms avoids dialectical gridlock.\n\n2.1 Perceiving vs. Predicting  \nTo perceive an action as goal-directed is to attribute an objective of some sort\u2014catching a ball, opening a door\u2014whereas predicting the kinematic unfolding of the action is to forecast its future trajectory. Resonance may aid fine-grained prediction without being required for categorical goal attribution.\n\n2.2 Causal vs. Constitutive Necessity  \nNT is sometimes read strongly (constitutive: resonance partly composes the perceptual content) and sometimes weakly (causal: normal perception cannot occur without prior resonance). I target both readings.\n\n2.3 Motor Resonance vs. Generic Simulation  \nMotor resonance is a specific, bodily emulation tied to one\u2019s effector repertoire (mirror-neuron firing, cortico-spinal facilitation). Generic simulation includes high-level analogical or inferential modeling independent of shared motor circuits. NT concerns the former.\n\n2.4 Goal-Directedness Levels  \nGoals may be overt (pressing a switch), distal (turning on the light) or mentalistic (wanting to read). Evidence for resonance at one level does not generalize automatically to others.\n\n3. Evidence Commonly Cited for the Necessity Thesis  \nMirror-neuron research underwrites much of NT. Briefly:\n\n(a) Neural Correlation: fMRI and single-cell studies show premotor regions active both when grasping and when observing grasping, suggesting shared coding.  \n(b) Disruption Studies: TMS over premotor cortex impairs recognition of unusual actions.  \n(c) Developmental Findings: Infants\u2019 own emerging motor abilities correlate with their sensitivity to others\u2019 goals.  \n\nTaken to establish necessity, these findings face three problems.\n\n3.1 The Fallacy of the Inferred Necessity  \nNeural correlation is not evidence of necessity. Vision of color and auditory signals co-activate multimodal cortex, yet color perception survives when those areas are lesioned.\n\n3.2 The Scope Problem  \nDisruption effects are selective: TMS over premotor areas impairs discrimination of biomechanically awkward grasps but leaves intact comprehension of everyday actions and of distal goals. The impairments concern kinematic fine-detail, not the perception of agency or purposiveness per se.\n\n3.3 The Developmental Equifinality Problem  \nInfants who cannot yet perform a specific action often still understand its goal. Six-month-olds unable to crawl nevertheless expect an agent to circumvent an obstacle to reach a toy (Liu et al., 2019). Correlation between own-action repertoire and action understanding may reflect parallel maturation or shared environmental learning, not necessity.\n\n4. Positive Evidence for Perception Without Resonance  \n\n4.1 Congenital Motor Deficits  \nPeople born without upper limbs (amelics) show normal abilities in recognizing others\u2019 manual actions and predicting their goals (Vannuscorps & Caramazza, 2016). Because they lack the motor schema for hand actions, resonance\u2014as mirroring of a missing effector\u2014is unavailable. Their success falsifies causal NT.\n\n4.2 Cross-Species and Cross-Effector Perception  \nHumans effortlessly perceive goal-directedness in an octopus manipulating shells, in a dog burying a bone, or even in a Roomba vacating a corner. Since our motor repertoire lacks tentacular, pawed, or vacuum\u2010based actions, resonance cannot underwrite these perceptions.\n\n4.3 Minimal-Cues Displays  \nHeider-Simmel animations of geometric shapes elicit robust perception of chasing, inviting, thwarting\u2014goals plentifully ascribed despite the absence of biological motion cues capable of triggering mirror neurons.\n\n4.4 Sensory Substitution Cases  \nVision-substituted blind observers using tactile arrays understand others\u2019 actions despite reduced or qualitatively different motor resonance. They exploit spatiotemporal patterns embedded in the stimuli, not shared motor plans.\n\n4.5 Virtual Avatars With Impossible Kinematics  \nObservers readily perceive the intention of avatars whose joints bend at impossible angles, provided environmental cues specify a coherent distal outcome (Kim & Waldrop, 2021). Mirror neurons tuned to realistic biomechanics cannot resonate with impossible limbs.\n\n5. A Pluralistic Cue-Integration Account  \n\n5.1 The Computational Motivation  \nPerception under uncertainty profits from integrating heterogeneous cues. Predictive-processing models treat the brain as minimizing prediction error via hierarchical generative models. Multiple priors can combine to yield robust inference. Nothing dictates that the motor prior be indispensable.\n\n5.2 The Cue Set for Goal Perception  \nFive chief cue classes suffice, singly or jointly, for goal attribution:\n\n1. Affordance Cues: Objects suggest actions (a cup affords grasping).  \n2. Environmental Constraints: Obstacles and paths shape rational action trajectories; viewers infer goals via the \u2018teleological stance\u2019 (Gergely & Csibra, 2003).  \n3. Kinematic Regularities: Biological motion patterns carry statistical signatures of purposeful behavior (e.g., minimum-jerk law).  \n4. Social-Pragmatic Signals: Gaze direction, facial expressions, linguistic cues.  \n5. Motor Resonance: First-person motor schemas.\n\nThe system weights these cues by reliability and context. When resonance is absent\u2014watching an octopus, or being tremor-paralyzed\u2014remaining cues compensate.\n\n5.3 Why Resonance Persists  \nIf resonance is dispensable, why keep it? Motor emulation offers (i) temporal precision for fine-grained prediction needed in real-time interaction and (ii) low-level noise reduction for familiar actions. It is adaptive but not indispensable\u2014akin to stereo vision in depth perception: helpful, yet monocular depth cues usually suffice.\n\n5.4 Constitutive vs. Epistemic Reduction  \nPerceptual content is not constituted by specific neural patterns but by their success in tracking distal properties. Multiple realisability defeats any constitutive necessity claim.\n\n6. Objections and Replies  \n\nObjection 1: Premotor lesions sometimes impair verb comprehension (\u2018to hammer\u2019). Doesn\u2019t that show constitutive necessity?  \nReply: Lesions produce subtle lexical-semantic deficits that group with tool conceptualization, not action goal perception per se. Patients still identify the intention (to drive a nail) though they struggle to pantomime. The impairment concerns motor praxis codes used in language, not perceptual attribution of goals.\n\nObjection 2: TMS disrupting mirror areas decreases accuracy on \u201cwhy\u201d (goal) questions, not only \u201chow\u201d (kinematic) ones.  \nReply: Decreased accuracy reflects slowed or noisy cue integration when a normally reliable source is down-weighted. Necessity is neither implied nor required; binocular occlusion similarly worsens depth judgment without making stereo vision necessary for depth perception.\n\nObjection 3: The amelic evidence may rely on vicarious resonance through remaining body parts; could they map hand actions onto foot motor schemas?  \nReply: fMRI shows no compensatory foot-area mirroring for hand actions in amelics. Moreover, they succeed even for mouth or head actions for which they also lack effector correspondence.\n\nObjection 4: Heider-Simmel cases involve high-level inference, not genuine perception. Isn\u2019t the debate about perceptual, not cognitive, attribution?  \nReply: Behavioral and ERP studies find early (~200 ms) modulations in visual cortex for goal-oriented dot motion, paralleling low-level visual processing. The attribution is automatic, fast, and exhibits signature features of perception (resistance to counter-evidence, phenomenological vividness).\n\nObjection 5: Pluralism risks unfalsifiability\u2014any failure of resonance can be hand-waved away by appealing to other cues.  \nReply: The account yields testable predictions: in contexts where all non-resonance cues are degraded (e.g., night-vision of unfamiliar actions), removing motor resonance should measurably impair goal perception. Conversely, when resonance is impossible but other cues are intact, performance should remain near-normal. Existing data conform to this pattern.\n\n7. Conclusion  \nMotor resonance enriches action perception but is not its sine qua non. A pluralistic cue-integration system\u2014evolutionarily prudent and computationally efficient\u2014explains both the utility of resonance when available and its dispensability across species, pathologies, and exotic contexts. Rejecting NT frees us to investigate how diverse information sources combine to yield the exquisite human capacity to see what others are up to, even when they act with bodies, tools, or trajectories radically unlike our own.\n\nReferences (abbr.)  \nGergely & Csibra (2003) \u201cTeleological reasoning.\u201d Liu et al.

Introduction and Thesis  \nMirror-neuron research has inspired a bold claim: my capacity to see your reaching as aimed at a cup depends on covertly rehearsing that reach in my own motor circuitry. Without such motor \u201cresonance,\u201d we are told, your behaviour would look like meaningless motion. I argue that this necessity claim is false. Motor resonance is (i) one among several routes by which the visual system can gain information about others\u2019 goals, (ii) a highly efficient but not obligatory route, and (iii) dispensable in principle and in some real-world cases. A multi-level \u201cteleo-predictive\u201d framework\u2014combining ecological specification of affordances with non-motor predictive inference\u2014accounts for the same phenomena while explaining evidence that resonance neither always occurs nor is always available. Resonance earns an important, modulatory role, but goal perception can survive its absence.\n\n2. Clarifying the Debate: Three Distinctions  \nBefore arguments are traded, we must disambiguate three pairs of notions that fuel confusion.\n\n2.1 Perceiving versus Inferring Goals  \nTo perceive a hand-movement as \u201cgrasping a cup\u201d is not merely to form a cold belief that a grasp will occur; it is to experience the movement as already organized toward that outcome. Whether such perceptual content is built from simulation or from \u201ctheory-like\u201d inference is the question at hand. Importantly, none of the protagonists deny that we often infer hidden intentions; the dispute concerns the *perceptual* registration of directedness.\n\n2.2 Necessary versus Enabling versus Modulatory Conditions  \nA *necessary* condition must be present on every occasion of goal perception. An *enabling* condition must only hold in the background (e.g., neurons need oxygen). A *modulatory* factor improves speed or accuracy without being indispensable. The motor-necessity thesis claims resonance is necessary; my alternative casts it as modulatory.\n\n2.3 Motor Resonance Proper versus Predictive Coding  \nMirror activity is sometimes portrayed as the motor branch of a domain-general predictive brain. If so, failing mirror neurons might be compensated by other predictive hierarchies (visual, conceptual). The necessity claim tacitly assumes no such redundancy. My strategy is to show empirical pockets where the redundancy in fact does the job.\n\n3. The Case for Necessity: What Needs Answering  \nThe literature offers three main arguments.\n\nA. Intelligibility Argument (Gallese 2001): Purely visual motion lacks information about *why* it occurs; motor simulation supplies the \u201cmotor vocabulary\u201d that renders a kinematic pattern intelligible as grasping, giving perception its goal-content.  \n\nB. Developmental Coupling (Meltzoff & Iacoboni): Infants begin to recognize others\u2019 actions as goal-directed around the same time they can execute similar acts, suggesting sensorimotor coupling is causally critical.  \n\nC. Neural Correlation: fMRI and TMS show motor-system activation tightly time-locked to observing goal-directed action and predicting its completion; disrupting premotor cortex impairs prediction. If resonance is turned off, so is goal perception (or so the argument goes).\n\nTo refute necessity, I need only one counterexample in which goal-perception obtains without resonance. I will offer several, then explain why they undermine each of the above arguments.\n\n4. Evidence Against Necessity  \n\n4.1 Developmental Dissociations  \nNewborn chicks (Mascalzoni et al., 2010) prefer motion that results in goal-states (a smaller dot nestling under a bigger dot) despite lacking any motor capacity to perform such \u201ccovering\u201d themselves. Likewise, 3-month-old human infants who cannot yet reach nevertheless look longer at changed-goal tests, indicating they encoded earlier reaches in terms of goals (Luo, 2011). Developmentally, then, recognitional capacity can precede production.\n\n4.2 Neuropsychological Dissociations  \n\u2022 Ideomotor apraxia (Sirigu et al., 1995): Patients cannot imitate or plan certain actions but are still able to recognize others performing them and identify the intended object.  \n\u2022 Higher-level spinal cord injuries: Quadriplegic observers with no kinesthetic feedback and dramatically altered motor maps identify action goals at normal speed (Verri et al., 2018).  \n\u2022 Parkinson\u2019s disease: Dopaminergic depletion dampens motor resonance (reduced MEPs), yet recognition of familiar goal-actions remains near-typical (Pohl et al., 2016).\n\n4.3 Cross-Species and Impossible-Body Evidence  \nWe effortlessly perceive the goal of a dog jumping for a frisbee or of a bird snatching a worm. These actions lie outside our motor repertoire: no human can flap feathered wings. Simulation theorists reply that resonance works at an abstract level (grasping schema). But what is the content of such a schema if it no longer mirrors the observer\u2019s motor code? The abstraction moves us away from neural motoric detail and toward visual-kinematic or amodal representations, conceding the essential point that motor matching in one\u2019s *own* repertoire is dispensable.\n\n4.4 Tool-Use and Remote Action  \nSurgeons operating a robotic arm or gamers directing avatars still visually parse those robotic movements as slicing, gripping, etc., even though the causal chain runs through a joystick and the geometric articulation scarcely resembles a human limb. Goal recognition here rides on learned mappings between *external* kinematics and outcomes, again bypassing a shared motor format.\n\n4.5 Blind Expertise in Sports Broadcasting  \nRadio commentators who have never themselves executed a double-axel in figure skating nevertheless track complex motions in real time, predicting jumps and labeling them \u201cattempting a triple lutz.\u201d The fluency persists even when watching skeletal animation devoid of muscle cues. Vocal-motor rehearsal, if any, is enormously abstract.\n\nThese pockets collectively render resonance *contingent*: often present, sometimes absent, never strictly required.\n\n5. Why the Positive Data Are Compatible With Contingency  \n\n5.1 Finely Tuned Notoriety  \nWhen experiments compare intact versus TMS-disrupted premotor areas, they typically measure *anticipatory eye movements* or *time-to-completion estimation*. These tasks tap *predictive accuracy*, not the sheer perceptual *possession* of goals. A slightly delayed prediction is not a failure to perceive directedness. The data thus show that resonance boosts efficiency\u2014a modulatory role.\n\n5.2 Cofounding Task Demands  \nSome fMRI contrasts pit goal-directed versus random motion. Random motion is noisy; goal-motion is stereotyped; different low-level visual statistics alone can drive differential activation. That the motor system is *also* active may reveal recruitment, not necessity. Lesion evidence (Section 4.2) carries higher inferential weight and points the other way.\n\n5.3 Correlation Isn\u2019t Constraint  \nNeural correlation plausibly reflects the brain\u2019s bias toward opportunistic reuse: if motor circuits can help, they will. But reuse does not entail dependence. Vision recruits knowledge of gravity (vestibular) when available; astronauts lacking gravity still *see* objects as falling on Earth. An analogy: people sometimes subvocally rehearse text while reading; yet inner speech is not necessary for reading, as evidenced by sign-language users. Resonance stands to goal perception as subvocal rehearsal stands to comprehension.\n\n6. A Teleo-Predictive Alternative  \n\n6.1 Ecological Specification of Affordances  \nFollowing Gibson, the visually ambient energy array carries higher-order invariants\u2014changes in hand aperture relative to object width, velocity profiles that saturate near contact\u2014that specify prospective control laws. These invariants are ecological, not motoric: they can in principle be detected by any organism with the right filters, no bodily matching required. Carruthers\u2019 \u201caction pragmatism\u201d adds that perceiving the directedness is perceiving *affordances-in-the-making*, not mental states behind the scene.\n\n6.2 Hierarchical Bayesian Prediction  \nPredictive-processing models allow multiple generative pathways to hypothesize distal outcomes. Vision could predict \u201ccup will be grasped\u201d by referencing a goal library stored in associative cortex, while motor cortex remains silent. Error signals would still cascade down the hierarchy, refining hypotheses. Motor resonance is one possible predictor, but a visual-conceptual path can substitute.\n\n6.3 Why Evolution Keeps Resonance Around  \nIf non-motor routes suffice, why keep mirror systems? They are quick, low-dimensional, and energy-efficient for familiar actions that the organism itself performs. For social primates engaged in frequent turn-taking, speed may confer fitness. But evolution often supports redundancies: binocular vision is not necessary for depth perception (monocular cues suffice), yet both are maintained.\n\n6.4 The Division of Labor  \nThe resulting picture is pluralistic:\n\n\u2022 Visual-kinematic invariants supply basic goal perception.  \n\u2022 Motor resonance accelerates prediction and enables vicarious motor noise (empathy, motor learning).  \n\u2022 Conceptual-semantic systems handle unfamiliar or abstract actions (stock-market trading).\n\nCrucially, the first route does not rely on the second, though they often co-operate.\n\n7. Objections and Replies  \n\nObjection 1: The apraxia and paralysis cases might retain degraded yet sufficient mirror activity below detection thresholds.  \nReply: Even if tiny residual resonance exists, the necessity thesis demands *complete* failure of goal perception in its absence. Demonstrations with congenitally limbless individuals (Vannuscorps & Caramazza, 2015) show no correlation between missing limbs (and hence missing limb motor maps) and deficits in perceiving corresponding limb actions in others.\n\nObjection 2: Cross-species perception piggybacks on high-level analogical mapping that still invokes one\u2019s own motor system at a schematic level.  \nReply: A schematic level that no longer preserves effector geometry or muscle synergies is not \u201cmotor\u201d in any robust neuroscientific sense. The mirror network\u2019s hallmark is somatotopy; watching birds activates extrastriate body areas, not premotor hand fields. The burden of proof shifts back to the necessitarian to specify what counts as motor.\n\nObjection 3: Eye-tracking shows infants anticipate goal-objects only when they can perform the reach themselves.  \nReply: Contradictory data already cited (Luo 2011). Moreover, anticipation is distinct from perceptual attribution. An infant might *see* the reach as goal-directed yet lack the motricity to forecast endpoint timing. Again: facilitation, not necessity.\n\n8. Broader Philosophical Implications  \n\n8.1 Against Embodiment Extremism  \nThe contingency of resonance weakens strong \u201cembodied cognition\u201d claims that bodily formats ground all social cognition. A moderate embodiment stays: bodies matter, but they are one format among several.\n\n8.2 Direct Perception Rehabilitated  \nIf goal-content can be specified by visual invariants, then perceiving agency need not pass through opacity-providing intellectual inference. We can be direct realists about others\u2019 goals without being motor simulationists.\n\n8.3 Moral and Clinical Payoffs  \nUnderstanding that resonance is optional opens avenues for autism therapies that enhance visual-conceptual parsing without trying to \u201cfix\u201d mirror neurons; likewise, brain-machine interface designs need not replicate human kinematics to be intuitively interpretable by surgeons.\n\n9. Conclusion  \nMotor resonance is a versatile, evolutionarily sensible shortcut for decoding familiar goal-directed action. Yet the empirical and conceptual landscape shows it is neither logically nor causally necessary. Goal perception survives in infants too young to act, in patients unable to move, across species boundaries, and in tool-mediated contexts where geometric mismatch nullifies any literal mirroring.

Ever since the first reports of mirror neurons, many philosophers have claimed that when I watch you reach for an apple, what makes the movement intelligible as goal-directed is the covert activation of my own motor code for grasping.  Strip away that resonance, they say, and all that would remain is a meaningless trajectory through space.  In this essay I argue that this is a mistake.  While motor resonance can enrich and stabilize action perception, it is not a necessary condition for perceiving goal-directedness.  I defend a pluralist, \u201cmulti-cue teleological\u201d account on which goal-directed actions can be\u2014and often are\u2014perceived independently of resonance mechanisms.  I proceed as follows.  Section 1 disentangles the thesis at issue, drawing distinctions between causal contribution, constitutive dependence, and modality-specific sufficiency.  Section 2 reconstructs the best case for the necessity claim.  Sections 3\u20134 develop two complementary lines of critique: a conceptual argument that the necessity thesis trades on a category mistake, and an empirical argument from cases in which action goals are perceived despite absent or impossible resonance.  Section 5 offers a positive model that integrates kinematic, contextual, and normative cues without requiring motor simulation.  Section 6 replies to three objections on behalf of the resonance theorist.  I close by sketching implications for developmental psychology, social robotics, and the philosophy of mind.\n\n1. Clarifying the Target Thesis\n\nTalk of \u201cnecessity\u201d is notoriously liable to equivocation.  We must ask:\n\na. Logical necessity: Is it conceptually incoherent to attribute goal perception without resonance?\n\nb. Constitutive necessity: Is resonance part of what it is to perceive goal-directedness (in the way that retinal stimulation is part of what it is to see)?\n\nc. Causal/empirical necessity: In biologically typical humans, does goal perception never occur unless resonance is also occurring?\n\nThe boldest mirror-theoretic papers often blur (b) and (c).  For present purposes I grant that resonance is often present; the live question is whether (b) holds, and whether (c) survives careful empirical scrutiny.  I shall argue that both answers are negative.\n\nWe also need clarity about \u201cgoal-directed action perception.\u201d  I will reserve the term for the perceptual availability of an action\u2019s telic organisation\u2014the \u201caboutness\u201d toward an outcome\u2014prior to or independent of explicit theoretical inference.  In vision science this corresponds to the ability to anticipate the action\u2019s completion point, to assign a privileged segmentation of movement phases, and to treat agent and patient as bound in a causal nexus.\n\n2. The Best Resonance-Necessity Argument\n\nMirror theorists marshal three considerations.\n\n2.1 Phenomenological immediacy.  When I watch Serena Williams serve, I do not see brute arm angles; I see \u201cpreparing to launch\u201d and \u201cdriving through the ball.\u201d  The claim is that only by covertly rehearsing the serve does the motion attain that intentional gestalt.\n\n2.2 Timing and prediction.  Motor cortex activity in observers is time-locked to the observed kinematics and leads peak velocity by ~100 ms, supporting the idea that the observer\u2019s motor system forward-models the impending goal.  Disrupting premotor cortex with TMS impairs prediction of an action\u2019s endpoint.\n\n2.3 Developmental mirroring.  Infants show both early mirror-EEG rhythms and early sensitivity to the goals of grasping\u2014suggesting a maturational coupling rather than a late learned inference.\n\nFrom these data the necessity thesis infers: if mirror activation is always present when goal perception occurs and if interfering with it sometimes disrupts prediction, then resonance is a prerequisite.\n\n3. Conceptual Problems: A Category Mistake\n\nThe resonance-necessity thesis rests on conflating \u201cvehicle\u201d with \u201ccontent.\u201d  Perceiving goal-directedness is an achievement at the level of representational content: I apprehend the telic structure \u201cgrasp-for-apple.\u201d  Motor resonance, by contrast, specifies a particular neural vehicle in the perceiver.  But content and vehicle stand in a many-to-many relation: the same content can in principle be implemented by distinct vehicles\u2014linguistic description, abstract imagery, logical form, or motor codes.  Unless a bridging principle is supplied, the mere fact that a certain neural dynamic often carries the content does not entail that no other vehicle could.  The necessity claim thus over-generalises from habitual co-occurrence to constitutive indispensability.\n\nAn analogy: When expert chess players swiftly recognise a mating net, fMRI shows motor-planning activity in premotor regions (associated with \u201cgrasping\u201d the piece).  Yet no one would claim that motor planning is necessary for seeing a chess threat; a paralysed mathematician could appreciate the position without it.  The burden is on the mirror theorist to show that the action case is disanalogous.\n\n4. Empirical Counter-Evidence\n\n4.1 Morphological mismatch cases.  Humans readily perceive the goal structure in actions they cannot possibly execute: the soaring trajectory of an eagle diving for prey; the hydraulic pistoning of industrial robots on an assembly line; an octopus manipulating a jar with eight arms.  Fine-tuned kinematic sensitivity and anticipatory gaze are preserved (Flanagan & Johansson 2003) despite the absence of any executable motor homologue.\n\n4.2 Congenital limb absence.  Vannuscorps and Caramazza (2016) studied individuals born without upper limbs.  Despite lacking motor programs for grasping, they show normal performance in visual tasks requiring anticipation of hand-action goals, and their ventral premotor cortex still displays mirror-like selectivity.  Either resonance is not necessary, or the brain opportunistically re-uses other bodily schemas, but then the specificity thesis collapses.\n\n4.3 Tool novelty and rapid adaptation.  Observers quickly perceive goal structure in newly introduced, culturally unfamiliar tools (e-g., a mechanised apple-peeler).  The speed of comprehension (within a single demonstration) outpaces the time needed to form a reliable motor program for that tool, suggesting that visual-contextual inference suffices.\n\n4.4 TMS dissociations.  Although disrupting premotor cortex can impair fine-grained kinematic prediction, it does not abolish categorical goal attribution (Pobric & Hamilton 2006).  Participants still judge \u201che is reaching for X\u201d with high accuracy; what suffers is reaction time or trajectory extrapolation.  That points to a facilitatory, not necessary, role.\n\n4.5 Infants before motor mastery.  Six-month-olds, who cannot yet perform means-end cloth-pulling to retrieve a toy, nevertheless look longer at inefficient cloth-pulls, implying goal expectation (Sommerville et al. 2005).  Their resonance system for that action is, at best, immature.\n\n5. A Multi-Cue Teleological Model\n\nIf resonance is not required, how do we see goals?  I propose a three-layer account.\n\n5.1 Kinematic heuristics.  Human vision is exquisitely sensitive to a non-accidental relation between velocity profiles and invariant outcomes (the \u201cminimum-jerk\u201d principle).  Movements that conform to efficient paths through joint space are classified as intentional rather than mechanical noise (Csibra 2008).  This analysis is modality-general: any system that learns the mapping from trajectories to stable distal states can exploit it.\n\n5.2 Affordance mapping.  Vision simultaneously parses the scene for affordances: graspable size, reachable distance, obstructing barriers.  When an agent\u2019s motion reduces the gap between its effector and an affordant object, the motion is encoded under the relational predicate \u201ctoward.\u201d  Crucially, this is a relational visual property, not a motor rehearsal; it can occur for spiders and drones.\n\n5.3 Normative pragmatics.  Perception of goals is also shaped by stored scripts of what beings of that type typically want.  Call this the \u201cteleological prior.\u201d  It is updated by statistical learning and can override kinematics (e.g., seeing a zig-zag path as \u201cdodging obstacles\u201d rather than \u201caimless\u201d).  This layer accounts for cultural actions whose kinematics are opaque but contextually meaningful, like a priest raising a chalice.\n\nMotor resonance enters this architecture as an optional booster pack: because my motor system embodies efficient action knowledge, simulating your movement provides a shortcut to identifying kinematic heuristics and affordances.  But the heuristics and affordances are conceptually independent and can be computed via purely perceptual and associative resources.\n\nWe can express the dependence graph formally:\n\nGoal Perception  \u2190  {Kinematics, Contextual Affordances, Teleological Priors, (Motor Resonance)}\n\nwhere curly braces denote jointly sufficient but individually defeasible inputs, and parentheses denote an enhancing but dispensable channel.\n\n6. Replies to Three Objections\n\nObjection 1: \u201cLatent resonance.\u201d  Perhaps observers covertly map the action into motor schemata at a more abstract level (e.g., \u2018effect-controlled descriptors\u2019) even when the effector morphology differs.\n\nReply: To salvage necessity, the theorist must stretch \u201cmotor\u201d to include any abstract effector-independent code for causal generation of outcomes.  But that gambit empties the thesis of empirical content: the purportedly distinctive mechanism becomes indistinguishable from general predictive coding.  A claim so general cannot explain the specific mirror physiology originally motivating it.\n\nObjection 2: \u201cDevelopmental primacy.\u201d  Infants might initially rely on resonance to bootstrap goal perception, even if adults later add visual heuristics.\n\nReply: The developmental evidence points the other way.  Neonates track the goal states of a grasping motion before they can grasp and before canonical mu-rhythm suppression appears (Filippi et al. 2020).  An ontogenetic story that posits resonance first must assume unobserved prenatal motor simulations without proprioceptive calibration\u2014less parsimonious than assuming early-maturing visual heuristics.\n\nObjection 3: \u201cClinical deficit.\u201d  Apraxic patients with impaired motor planning also show deficits in action understanding, supporting necessity.\n\nReply: Apraxia rarely isolates resonance mechanisms; it involves widespread fronto-parietal damage that also compromises spatial attention and working memory.  Moreover, \u201caction understanding\u201d tasks in apraxia studies often demand verbal explanation, dragging in executive functions.  Double-dissociation evidence (e.g., patients with spared comprehension but impaired imitation) undermines the one-to-one mapping.\n\n7. Broader Implications\n\n7.1 Development.  On the multi-cue model, infants tune to goal-related kinematic regularities before fine motor control, shedding light on the paradox of \u201csmart\u201d expectations in action na\u00effs.  This predicts that altering environmental kinematic statistics\u2014through unconventional puppet shows\u2014should recalibrate goal perception without any change to the infant\u2019s motor abilities.  Preliminary data support this.\n\n7.2 Social robotics.  If robots must be intelligible to human observers, designers need not equip them with human-like joints; instead they must produce motion obeying efficient-trajectory heuristics and expose affordance cues.  Conversely, building resonance algorithms into our own recognition systems may be helpful but is not mandatory.\n\n7.3 Philosophy of mind.  The multi-cue story vindicates a \u201cteleological stance\u201d as perceptual and non-inferential while denying a strong form of the embodiment thesis.  It suggests that intentional objects can be visually given without motor identification, challenging enactivist claims that understanding is \u201cskillful coping all the way down.\u201d\n\nConclusion\n\nMotor resonance is an elegant and powerful component of social cognition, but mistaking it for the sine qua non of goal perception confuses frequent accompaniment with necessity.  Conceptually, goal perception is contentful whereas resonance specifies one family of vehicles.  Empirically, humans and other animals perceive goal-directed structure in actions they cannot perform, and individuals lacking matching motor programs do so as well.  A multi-cue teleological framework\u2014integrating kinematics, affordances, and normative priors\u2014explains how goal-directedness becomes perceptually transparent while leaving resonance as an optional facilitator.  Recognizing that perceptual systems can represent telic organization independently of embodiment not only resolves puzzles in developmental psychology and neuropsychology but also widens the space of viable artificial agents.  We should thus retire the necessity thesis in favor of a pluralist, layered account that more faithfully captures the richness of our social perceptual life.", "output_tokens": 3197, "reasoning_tokens": 512}

Ever since mirror neurons were first reported in macaques, philosophers and cognitive scientists have suggested a strong claim: mapping the observed kinematics onto one\u2019s own motor repertoire is a necessary condition for perceiving goal-directed actions at all. If I cannot in some sense \u201cdo it in my head,\u201d the thought goes, I cannot so much as see what you are doing. I will argue that this necessity claim is false. Motor resonance is one useful\u2014but dispensable\u2014resource in the perceptual economy that underwrites goal-ascription. \n\nMy thesis has three parts.\n\n1. Conceptual: The debate has conflated three different modalities of necessity\u2014constitutive, enabling, and facilitating. Only the strongest, constitutive claim is worth defending, but that claim is untenable.  \n2. Empirical: Whole classes of cases\u2014cross-species perception, tool-mediated actions, and perceivers with motor deficits\u2014show that people successfully perceive goals in the absence of resonant mapping. Neurophysiological data, when carefully interpreted, support a facilitative rather than necessary role for resonance.  \n3. Theoretical: A more adequate model treats goal-perception as a predictive, multi-level process in which kinematic, causal, and contextual information are combined. Resonance supplies one source of constraints on the inferential process, but other sources can substitute when resonance is weak or unavailable.\n\nBy distinguishing kinds of necessity, canvassing the counter-evidence, and offering a generative replacement model, I aim to move the discussion beyond a mirror-neuron monoculture toward a pluralistic, hierarchically organized view of social perception.\n\nI. Three kinds of \u201cnecessity\u201d  \nPhilosophers often prosecute the resonance thesis as though there were just one modal register, but talk of a \u201cnecessary condition\u201d can be unpacked in at least three ways:\n\n\u2022 Constitutive necessity: Resonance is part of what it *is* to perceive an action as goal-directed; without resonance, there is no such perception\u2014analogous to how color experience constitutively involves hue.  \n\u2022 Enabling necessity: Resonance is a background capacity whose intactness is required, even if not occurrent in every episode, like having a visual cortex is required for seeing red.  \n\u2022 Facilitating or epistemic necessity: Resonance expedites or stabilizes goal-perception in ordinary conditions, though alternative routes exist.\n\nMost proponents of the motor theory slip across these senses. Gallese & Sinigaglia, for instance, sometimes write as if resonance \u201cgrounds the *very possibility* of understanding action,\u201d suggesting constitutive necessity; elsewhere they speak more modestly of a \u201cdirect and efficient route.\u201d The empirical record thus far bears out only the facilitative reading. To defend the stronger claims, proponents would need both conceptual argument and incompatibility data\u2014cases in which goal-perception demonstrably fails *because* resonance is impossible. As we shall see, no such data exist, and plentiful counter-examples do. \n\nII. Three empirical pressure points\n\n1. Cross-species and morphologically novel actions  \nHumans readily perceive a dog\u2019s burying a bone, an octopus\u2019s opening a jar, or a swarm of robots cooperating to move a block as goal-directed. Yet mapping these actions onto one\u2019s *own* motor repertoire is impossible: I have neither prehensile tentacles nor hydraulic legs. A defender may reply that resonance operates at an abstract, effector-independent level. But the heavier the abstraction, the thinner the connection to the original, motoric notion of resonance; at some point it merely becomes predictive processing with motor *inspired* priors. Moreover, neuroimaging studies show diminished or absent mirror-area activity when participants view non-conspecific or biomechanically impossible movements, even while they make accurate goal judgments (Cross et al., 2010). This pattern strongly suggests that resonance is not required for success. \n\n2. Tool use and extended agency  \nSuppose I watch a skilled carpenter spin a drill whose rotational dynamics I have never executed. I effortlessly register that the goal is to drive the screw flush. The drill\u2019s operational degrees of freedom do not belong to my body schema; yet perception of the goal is immediate. Similar results arise in laboratory studies where participants view actors controlling cursors by unseen levers: goal-attribution tracks the distal cursor trajectory, not the proximal limb motion. If resonance with proximal kinematics were necessary, distal goal perception should collapse. It does not.\n\n3. Motor impairment and developmental dissociations  \nIndividuals with congenital limb absence perceive the goal of grasping just as well as controls, although they cannot form resonant motor plans for missing effectors (Vannuscorps & Caramazza, 2015). Likewise, children as young as eight months detect goal structure in animated shapes (Gergeley & Csibra, 2003) well before their own motor repertoire includes the observed motions. Conversely, patients with ideomotor apraxia may show impaired resonance yet intact goal recognition. Any single case might be explained away, but the convergence of developmental, clinical, and comparative evidence forms a cumulative argument against necessity.\n\nIII. Reinterpreting the pro-resonance data\n\nWhat, then, of the robust findings *for* motor resonance\u2014EMG modulation, corticospinal excitability, interference effects when executing incongruent actions, and so on? Two points matter.\n\nFirst, correlation does not establish necessity. Many cognitive processes recruit helpful but inessential resources: visuospatial rehearsal aids mental arithmetic; pre-motor imagery boosts memory for routes. The presence of recruitment shows only that the resource is *available* and often *used*.\n\nSecond, lesion and TMS studies that *disrupt* mirror areas typically report slowed or noisier goal judgments, not wholesale abolition. This pattern is the empirical signature of a facilitative mechanism. Compare semantic priming: knocking out lexical access slows naming but does not preclude it if conceptual links or phonological strategies can compensate.\n\nIV. A predictive, multi-source model of goal-perception\n\nRather than casting the debate in disjunctive terms\u2014resonance or no resonance\u2014I propose a hierarchical generative model inspired by recent work in computational cognitive science.\n\nLevel 1: Kinematics. The visual system extracts trajectories, velocities, and joint angles. Motor resonance offers one efficient way to predict likely next states, using one\u2019s forward models as quick-and-dirty simulators.\n\nLevel 2: Causal pragmatics. Independently of bodily simulation, observers possess rich knowledge about object affordances, environmental constraints, and action schemata. Bayesian inverse planning models show that goal-attribution can be computed by selecting the hypothesis that makes the observed trajectory *rational* given situational affordances (Baker, Saxe & Tenenbaum, 2009).\n\nLevel 3: Contextual and narrative priors. Social scripts, cultural expectations, and linguistic cues further constrain which goals are plausible. Seeing a person raise a glass during a toast primes the goal \u201ccelebrate\u201d even if the precise motor pattern is unfamiliar.\n\nPerception of action emerges from the integration of bottom-up sensory evidence with top-down predictions across all three levels. When resonance is available, it provides strong priors at Level 1, sharpening kinematic predictions and facilitating rapid segmentation. When resonance is unavailable\u2014because the effector is alien, the observer is motor-impaired, or the action is biomechanically impossible\u2014Levels 2 and 3 shoulder more of the inferential load. The system is degenerate in the biological sense: multiple different mechanisms can realize the same functional outcome. This is why goal-perception survives the loss or absence of resonance.\n\nV. Dialectical engagement: three objections and replies\n\nObjection 1: \u201cInterference effects prove that on-line resonance is constitutive\u2014you cannot voluntarily inhibit it without impairing goal-perception.\u201d  \nReply: Interference shows only that parallel recruitment can create competition for shared resources. Shadowing speech disrupts verbal working memory but does not entail that rehearsal is constitutive of remembering syllables. Likewise, transcranial disruption of the inferior frontal gyrus slows but does not abolish goal judgments, indicating resource overlap, not constitutive identity.\n\nObjection 2: \u201cAbstract resonance saves necessity: even when watching an octopus, you resonate at a higher, goal-equivalent level.\u201d  \nReply: This move is dialectically expensive. If resonance generalizes to any mapping between observed and internal generative models, the thesis collapses into the platitude that perception involves internal modeling\u2014true but no longer a distinctive motor claim. The original explanatory payoff\u2014grounding social cognition in *motor* re-use\u2014is forfeited.\n\nObjection 3: \u201cDevelopmental evidence shows that infants *learn* goal concepts through the calibration of self-generated and observed actions; later independence does not refute the necessity claim at the origin of the capacity.\u201d  \nReply: Even if motor experience bootstraps early goal concepts, that historical role does not secure constitutive necessity for mature perception. Reading might depend causally on early phonological awareness, yet once established, reading comprehension can survive phonological deficits (cf. deep dyslexia). The modal force of \u201cnecessity\u201d concerns synchronic dependence, not phylogenetic or ontogenetic pathways.\n\nVI. Precision in distinctions that matter\n\nThe foregoing argument hinges on three distinctions sometimes blurred in the literature:\n\nA. Seeing an *action* versus seeing a *goal*. The former concerns kinematic parsing; the latter, teleological interpretation. Resonance primarily aids the former, but the necessity claim is about the latter.\n\nB. *Experiential* immediacy versus *inferential* processes. One can grant that goal-perception feels immediate while insisting its underlying mechanism is inferentially rich\u2014and that resonance is only one contributor.\n\nC. *Constitutive* versus *explanatory* primacy. A process can be explanatorily privileged (e.g., easiest to study, neurally accessible) without being constitutively essential. Mirror research has been methodologically transformative; that does not license ontological elevation.\n\nVII. An upshot for social epistemology and artificial cognition\n\nIf goal-perception is multi-sourced and degenerate, several downstream consequences follow.\n\n1. Social learning need not be limited by motor similarity. Robots endowed with visual predictive models but mismatched effectors can still learn from human demonstrations without requiring morphological mirroring. This supports the design of heterogeneous collaborative systems.\n\n2. Cultural practices that reshape kinematics\u2014dance, sign language\u2014are intelligible across communities because higher-level pragmatic and contextual cues scaffold understanding, not because all observers can replicate the motions.\n\n3. Disorders of social cognition (e.g., autism) cannot be fully explained by mirror-system dysfunction. Interventions should target broader predictive and contextual integration abilities.\n\nVIII. Conclusion\n\nMotor resonance is a fascinating, evolutionarily elegant trick: it allows us to recycle pre-existing motor circuits for rapid, low-cost prediction of others\u2019 movements. Yet fascination can breed over-reach. The evidence, properly weighed, shows that resonance is neither constitutively nor enablingly necessary for perceiving goal-directed actions. Rather, it is one facilitative strand in a braided architecture that integrates kinematic simulation, causal reasoning, and contextual priors. Appreciating this pluralism not only resolves apparent anomalies in the data but also opens new research avenues\u2014into how these strands cooperate, compensate, and sometimes come apart.\n\nPhilosophy\u2019s task is not merely to laud the latest neuroscientific discovery but to place it within a conceptual topology that honors complexity. The mirror-neuron story, once hailed as the \u201cneural basis of social cognition,\u201d is strongest when understood as a contributory chapter, not the whole book. When we see another person reach, grasp, or dance, what we perceive is not just motion in need of simulation, but agency situated in a world of affordances, reasons, and norms. That richer picture can survive, and indeed flourish, without the metaphysical crutch of motor necessity.", "output_tokens": 2932, "reasoning_tokens": 384}

A widely discussed proposal says that such resonance is not just contingently correlated with social perception but is a necessary pre-condition for seeing another\u2019s behaviour as goal-directed. Roughly: I can visually register an arm rising toward a cup without resonance, but I can perceive the rise as a reach-to-grasp only if I covertly simulate how I myself would reach and grasp. In this essay I argue that this necessity claim is overstated. Motor resonance facilitates and enriches goal-ascription, especially under challenging conditions, but it is neither conceptually nor empirically required. Goal-directed actions can be perceived via informational, contextual, and normative cues that do not depend on instantiating the witnessed motor schema in one\u2019s own body. \n\nThe argument unfolds in six stages. (1) I disambiguate kinds of \u201cnecessity\u201d at play and clarify what counts as \u201cperceiving a goal.\u201d (2) I reconstruct the main empirical and philosophical arguments for the necessity thesis and extract their strongest form. (3) I present counter-evidence from developmental psychology, neuropsychology, and cross-species studies that breaks the alleged entailment.

(5) I respond to the best remaining objections. (6) I sketch novel experimental predictions that could adjudicate between necessity and facilitation views.  \n\n1. Varieties of Necessity and Varieties of Goal Perception  \n\u201cNecessary\u201d can mean at least three things here.  \n\na. Logical necessity: Analytically, the very concept of seeing an action as goal-directed entails resonance; denying it is self-contradictory.  \n\nb. Constitutive necessity: Resonance is part of the constitutive mechanism of goal-perception; remove it and the capacity, though conceptually intact, collapses.  \n\nc. Enabling necessity: In actual humans, some resonance is always present and causally required, though in principle other organisms might do without it.  \n\nMost proponents implicitly defend (b) or (c). The logical version is rarely held because we can at least imagine aliens with no homology to our motor system successfully reading our behaviour. We thus focus on constitutive and enabling claims.  \n\nWe must likewise distinguish perceiving an event\u2019s physical kinematics (\u201cthe arm rose 35 degrees\u201d), perceiving it as purposeful (\u201cshe is reaching\u201d), and recognising a determinate goal (\u201cto grasp the cup in order to drink\u201d). The necessity thesis targets the middle layer: purposiveness perception.  \n\n2. The Best Case for Necessity  \nThe argument usually comes in four strands.  \n\ni. Mirror-correlation: fMRI and TMS studies show that observation of grasping, kicking, and so forth activates the same motor areas used for execution, with strength modulated by goal clarity.  \n\nii. Developmental congruence: Infants\u2019 EEG mu-suppression during action observation predicts their later ability to parse continuous movement into goal-related chunks.  \n\niii. Occlusion-completion: When the decisive part of an action is visually masked, adults can nonetheless anticipate its outcome; prediction accuracy tracks motor excitability.  \n\niv. Path-integration: Phenomenology of \u201cunderstanding from within\u201d seems absent when we watch completely unfamiliar effectors (e.g., a squid\u2019s tentacles) or impossible movements; we default to mere kinematic description unless we can imagine doing it ourselves.  \n\nThese findings, taken together, are supposed to show that motor resonance is integral to extracting teleological structure from the visual stream.  \n\n3. Counter-Evidence: Breaking the Entailment  \nA minimal counterexample suffices to refute a necessity claim. We possess several kinds.  \n\na. Congenital Limb Absence. Individuals born without arms exhibit no cortical arm motor regions and cannot, strictly speaking, simulate arm movements. Yet they effortlessly recognise reaches, points, and throws as goal-directed. Vannuscorps and Caramazza (2016) showed that such individuals anticipate the outcome of a grasp as accurately and as quickly as two-armed controls. Their visual system treats arm actions as teleological despite lacking the matching motor schema.  \n\nb. Locked-in Syndrome and High Spinal Cord Injury. Patients with complete motor paralysis, whose efference copy pathways are silent, retain normal performance at implicit goal-detection tasks (e.g., violation-of-expectation paradigms using gaze tracking). Hence the perceptual judgment persists when overt and covert motor execution are offline.  \n\nc. Cross-Species Perception. Dogs reliably follow human pointing and even interpret head-fake direction changes in basketball, despite the relevant limb degrees of freedom being absent in canines. Conversely, humans intuit the predatory intent in a lion\u2019s stalk though we cannot recruit leonine motor programmes. Goal perception clearly leaps across anatomical divides.  \n\nd. Pictorial Depictions. We see the point of the archer\u2019s frozen gesture in a medieval tapestry\u2014where no motion exists to be simulated. Yet purposiveness is immediately apprehended. The resonance system, tuned to dynamic parameters, cannot discharge in a static image.  \n\ne. Novel Tool Use. Observers na\u00efve to fencing see a competitor\u2019s feint as a tactic, not random stick-waving, long before they could mimic it. Expertise improves subtle inference, but lack of executionability does not block initial goal ascription.  \n\nThese cases jointly undermine constitutive and enabling necessity. They suggest that resonance is at most one route among several, and that other routes are sufficient.  \n\n4. A Three-Layer Ecological-Predictive Account  \nHow, then, is goal-perception possible without resonance? I propose that the visual system exploits three nested information layers, any of which can suffice; resonance piggy-backs mainly on layer one.  \n\nLayer 1: Kinematic Specifications of Affordances. Certain movement profiles \u201cspecify\u201d their goals in the Gibsonian sense: the hand\u2019s pre-shape mirrors an object\u2019s geometry 200 ms before contact; a projectile launched on a parabolic arc advertises interception. Such optical invariants are picked up directly. Motor resonance can amplify salience here, but the requisite information is in the stimulus.  \n\nLayer 2: Instrumental Context. Objects, relations, and background regularities supply statistical priors. Seeing knife, bread, and breakfast time biases an observer toward slicing goals. Bayesian models show that purely visual priors, sans motor mirroring, yield human-level performance on goal-prediction tasks given rich context (Baker et al. 2009).  \n\nLayer 3: Narrative Scripts and Norms. Over years we internalise social scripts (\u201cordering coffee,\u201d \u201chailing a taxi\u201d) that license goal attributions from minimal cues. These scripts are linguistic and conceptual, thus indifferent to motor mirroring. Watching a raised hand at an auction, we infer bidding intentions not by covertly rehearsing a bid but by recognising a social convention.  \n\nPerception of purposiveness is the upshot of weighted integration across these layers\u2014a predictive coding hierarchy where higher layers constrain lower ones. Motor resonance occupies the lowest rung and offers fast, albeit anatomically limited, predictions. Disable it, and higher layers compensate, sometimes at a cost to speed or subtlety but without losing the capacity. The picture reconciles why resonance is ubiquitous yet dispensable.  \n\n5. Replies to Objections  \nObjection 1: The deafferented and limb-absent studies merely show that cortical territory is reassigned; maybe \u201cmotor\u201d circuits actually redeploy to visual goals so the same mechanism persists.  \n\nReply: fMRI evidence reveals that such individuals repurpose traditional hand areas for foot or mouth actions; yet activation during observed arm actions appears in canonical visual areas, not in reorganised motor cortex. So the system does not secretly re-instantiate arm mirroring; it routes around it.  \n\nObjection 2: Even if resonance is not strictly necessary in mature adults, perhaps it is developmentally necessary\u2014children bootstrap goal concepts by mapping others onto their own repertoire and later can do without the crutch.  \n\nReply: Longitudinal data undermine this. Infants born with perinatal stroke affecting motor cortex still form expectations about others\u2019 goals at six months (Bowering 2022). Conversely, infants show goal-prediction for mechanical claws that lack humanlike embodiment after brief familiarisation, suggesting domain-general statistical learning rather than motor mapping drives the acquisition.  \n\nObjection 3: The phenomenology of \u201cI get what she\u2019s doing\u201d correlates with resonance, so resonance is constitutive of understanding even if cold cognition works around it.  \n\nReply: First-person phenomenology can track ancillary processes that enrich experience without constituting the core epistemic success condition. Colour saturation enhances scene recognition but is not required; likewise, motor resonance may contribute a felt sense of fluency without underwriting the perceptual content.  \n\n6. Forward-Looking Tests  \nMy view predicts graded dissociations.  \n\nPrediction A: Under visual noise (partial occlusion), observers with motor impairments should show a disproportionate deficit relative to full-vision trials, because higher layers compensate more slowly when bottom-up kinematic information is corrupted and resonance is unavailable.  \n\nPrediction B: Tasks hinging on narrative scripts (e.g., interpreting the silent raising of a paddle in an auction video) should show no performance difference between participants whose resonance is TMS-suppressed versus controls.  \n\nPrediction C: In MEG time-course analyses, narrative-script based goal perception should evoke late frontal activations independent of early mu-suppression typically tied to resonance.  \n\nIf these divergent signatures obtain, motor resonance is best understood as a speed-optimising but non-mandatory ingredient.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe appeal of the necessity thesis rests on an admirable empirical punchline: motor systems are surprisingly entangled with perception. Yet the entanglement thesis outstrips the data when elevated to a requirement. Cases of absent, impaired, or cross-species motor match show that humans (and other animals) can and do perceive purposiveness without simulating it. A richer ecological-predictive architecture\u2014one that integrates kinematic affordances, instrumental context, and narrative scripts\u2014explains both the ubiquity of resonance and its dispensability. Far from demoting resonance, this view clarifies its ecological niche: it is the system\u2019s fast, anatomy-anchored heuristic for reading the animate world, but not the bedrock of social understanding.  \n\nRethinking the hierarchy in this way has practical and theoretical payoffs. In robotics, it cautions against over-investment in humanoid emulation for action recognition; in clinical neuropsychology, it suggests alternative rehabilitation strategies that rely on contextual training rather than motor imagery. Philosophically, it punctures a lingering Cartesianism in which the body must re-enact to understand. Perception of goals is grounded as much in the world\u2019s visible order and our cultural scripts as in the silent murmurs of our motor cortex.", "output_tokens": 2700, "reasoning_tokens": 320}

Because this \u201cmirroring\u201d often co-occurs with my correct appreciation of what you are doing\u2014drinking, tidying, or toasting\u2014some theorists have proposed a strong necessity claim:\n\nNecessity Thesis (NT): In normal human cognition, the perceptual attribution of a goal to an observed action requires the observer to covertly map that action onto her own motor repertoire; without such motor resonance, the action could not be seen as goal-directed.\n\nI will argue that NT is false. Motor resonance is neither conceptually nor empirically necessary for perceiving goal-directed actions, although it can enrich, speed, and stabilize such perception. After clarifying the key notions (Section 1), I steel-man the case for NT (Section 2). The next three sections dismantle that case: a conceptual critique (Section 3), empirical counter-evidence (Section 4), and a positive alternative model that secures goal perception independently of resonance while explaining the genuine contribution that resonance nevertheless makes (Section 5). I close by addressing residual objections (Section 6) and summarizing the upshot (Section 7).\n\n1. Clarifying the Terrain\n\n(1) Perception of goal-directed action. I take it that to perceive a movement as goal-directed is to experience it as organized around some distal end\u2014grasping the cup, shielding one\u2019s eyes, courting a mate\u2014rather than as mere kinematic change. The claim concerns perceptual experience, not post-perceptual inference: the goal figures as what the movement is \u201cup to\u201d in our immediate apprehension of it.\n\n(2) Motor resonance. I use the term broadly for automatic activation of an observer\u2019s own motor schemata that are isomorphic or homologous to the action observed. This construct encompasses classical mirror-neuron firings, covert muscle recruitment detectable by EMG, or sub-threshold motor excitability measured by TMS.\n\n(3) Necessity. NT holds that without such resonance the perceptual experience of goal-directedness cannot occur. This is a strong metaphysical and psychological claim, not merely the statistical hypothesis that resonance usually accompanies goal perception.\n\n2. The Steel-Manned Case for Necessity\n\nProponents of NT typically advance three lines of argument.\n\nA. Predictive Efficiency. The motor system is exquisitely tuned for the forward modeling of bodily motion. If perception recruits the best available predictor of the unfolding trajectory, then mapping the observed limb onto one\u2019s own motor circuits is the uniquely effective route to anticipating the action\u2019s future course and hence to grasping its goal.\n\nB. Developmental Evidence. Infants\u2019 ability to perceive an adult\u2019s reaching as goal-directed seems to wax and wane with their own motor accomplishments. Six-month-olds who have learned to sit and reach purportedly succeed at recognizing others\u2019 reaching goals; pre-reachers do not. This motor-first chronology suggests a constitutive dependence.\n\nC. Causal Disruption. TMS applied to premotor areas dampens both mirror-neuron signals and performance on on-line goal-discrimination tasks. The same holds for patients with premotor lesions: impairments in action understanding correlate with dampened resonance mechanisms.\n\nThese considerations, we are told, justify NT: resonance is not merely correlated but required.\n\n3. Conceptual Scrutiny of the Necessity Thesis\n\nThe central conceptual weakness in NT is an equivocation between being one *route* to goal perception and being the *only possible route*. Three distinctions sharpen the point.\n\n3.1. Trajectory vs. Teleology. Predicting the time course of a limb\u2019s motion is not equivalent to perceiving its teleology. I may compute that your hand will occupy a volume of space at t + 200 ms without representing any distal end. Conversely I can see that you are \u201cwaving good-bye\u201d even if I cannot predict the precise path each finger will trace.\n\n3.2. Simulation vs. Specification. A system may specify a property without simulating the process that realizes it. My thermostat tracks ambient temperature without simulating molecular kinetics. Likewise, the visual system may specify the goal of a movement by extracting invariant relational cues (e.g., hand-object alignment, inverse-velocity\u2013distance law, minimal-jerk paths) without motoric reenactment.\n\n3.3. Affordance vs. Imitation. Seeing a cup as *graspable* is not the same as covertly rehearsing a grasp. Affordance perception, as Gibson emphasized, is realized in dorsal\u2013visual pathways that need not engage overt motor plans. NT ignores the possibility that affordance recognition furnishes the perceptual basis for goal attribution.\n\nOnce these distinctions are kept in view, the conceptual inference from \u201cthe motor system can help\u201d to \u201cthe motor system is required\u201d collapses.\n\n4. Empirical Counter-Evidence to Necessity\n\n4.1. Goal Perception in Non-Embodied Observers. People readily perceive goal-directedness in geometrical animations (Heider-Simmel triangles chasing one another) or in the movements of robots whose kinematics differ sharply from human biomechanics. Observers attribute goals to the Roomba\u2019s arc around the sofa, despite lacking any motor program that would reproduce that trajectory.\n\n4.2. Congenital Limb Absence. Individuals born without upper limbs nevertheless identify manual actions as readily as neurotypical controls. Vannuscorps and Caramazza (2016) report typical performance on action-understanding tasks in those with agenesis of arms; yet their premotor cortex lacks the usual hand-mirroring circuitry.\n\n4.3. Cross-Species Perception. Humans efficiently recognize goal-directed hunting behaviors of cheetahs, birds weaving nests, or octopuses opening jars\u2014behaviors that share no musculoskeletal homology with human action. Conversely, octopuses have been shown to anticipate fish escape trajectories. Such cross-species perception cannot rely on matching the observed action to one\u2019s own motor repertoire.\n\n4.4. Developmental Dissociations. Recent longitudinal studies refine the classic infant literature. When controlling for general attentional maturity and object knowledge, the correlation between infants\u2019 own reaching milestones and their capacity to detect others\u2019 goals diminishes sharply. Moreover, pre-term infants\u2014who are motorically delayed\u2014nonetheless pass habituation-dishabituation paradigms detecting goal changes before they acquire the corresponding motor skills.\n\n4.5. Neurological Sparing. Lesions of mirror-neuron areas need not impair goal perception. Buccino et al. (2019) document patients with premotor damage who, although unable to imitate, differentiate goal-consistent from goal-inconsistent actions at normal levels.\n\nThese findings refute the modal claim that motor resonance is necessary for perceiving goal-directedness.\n\n5. A Dual-Route Teleological Model\n\nHow, then, do we perceive goals? I propose a Dual-Route Teleological (DRT) model.\n\nRoute A: Visual-affordance extraction. Dedicated dorsal-stream mechanisms compute \u201cstructured affordances\u201d directly from optic flow and object geometry. A hand approaching a graspable object in an energy-efficient trajectory produces optic patterns (velocity profiles, wrist orientation, aperture scaling) that specify, in Gibsonian fashion, the impending contact. The observer need not rehearse the grasp; the affordance is registered as a visual invariant.\n\nRoute B: Motor resonance. In parallel, if the observed movement falls within the observer\u2019s motor repertoire\u2014roughly, if homology and scale make mapping feasible\u2014premotor circuits instantiate a covert model that predicts proprioceptive consequences were *I* performing the action. This simulation refines temporal predictions, scaffolds fine-grained anticipation, and enables rapid error detection.\n\nThe two routes converge downstream in temporo-parietal hubs (pSTS/TPJ) that integrate goal hypotheses with contextual cues (object identity, social norms) to yield a percept of action-in-pursuit-of-a-goal. Critically, either route can suffice, although the presence of both increases speed and robustness. Hence resonance is *facilitative* rather than *necessary*.\n\nThe DRT model explains:\n\n\u2022 Non-human motion. Route A extracts affordance-aligned cues without Route B, letting us see the goal of a snake striking prey.\n\n\u2022 Congenital limb absence. Route A remains intact; Route B is degraded or absent, yet goal perception survives.\n\n\u2022 TMS disruptions. Premotor interference slows reaction times or diminishes predictive sharpness (Route B compromised), but basic goal- detection via Route A persists, explaining partial, not total, deficits.\n\n\u2022 Developmental data. Motor skill acquisition richly tunes Route B, boosting infants\u2019 discriminatory precision precisely when affordance extraction is already nascent, accounting for the partial correlations.\n\n6. Addressing Residual Objections\n\nObjection 1: But goal perception in geometric animations is less vivid, arguably involving imaginative reconstruction rather than direct perception.\n\nReply. Phenomenologically, many viewers report immediate, irresistible animacy and purpose. Moreover, eye-tracking reveals anticipatory saccades keyed to the triangle\u2019s \u201cgoal object,\u201d indicating online perceptual guidance, not post-hoc inference.\n\nObjection 2: Premotor lesions sometimes yield severe action-understanding deficits.\n\nReply. Severity depends on task demands. When tasks require extrapolating the *kinematics* of a still-unfolding action (e.g., predicting the exact time of contact), the loss of Route B is crippling. But this is precisely the predictive precision provided by resonance; it does not show necessity for *basic* goal perception.\n\nObjection 3: Neuromodulation studies show mirror activity as early as 120 ms post-stimulus\u2014too early for affordance extraction that purportedly involves slower dorsal processing.\n\nReply. First, dorsal stream computations can complete within 100 ms in grasping tasks. Second, early premotor activity might be top-down excitation seeded by rapid affordance signals in pSTS, not the initial causal driver of goal representation. Chronology alone does not resolve directionality.\n\n7. Conclusion\n\nMotor resonance is an elegant biological solution for tracking conspecific actions, but it is one solution among several. The conceptual conflation of prediction with teleology has misled theorists into asserting necessity where only facilitation holds. Empirical findings from congenital limb absence, cross-species perception, abstract animations, and lesion studies collectively falsify the necessity thesis.\n\nThe Dual-Route Teleological model reconciles these data: goal perception can be subserved by purely visual-affordance mechanisms, while motor resonance, when available, fine-tunes temporal and proprioceptive predictions. Viewing the motor system as a modulatory *booster* rather than an indispensable *base* aligns with a broader ecological stance: organisms exploit multiple partially redundant pathways to secure behaviorally critical information. Perception of goal-directed action is too important to be left to a single mechanism.\n\nRecognizing resonance as optional yet advantageous shifts experimental and philosophical focus. Instead of asking whether mirror neurons are the seat of social cognition, we should ask how various circuits collaborate to yield flexible, cross-contextual understanding. That perspective promises richer accounts of neurodiversity, developmental plasticity, and the design of artificial agents capable of recognizing and participating in the goals of others\u2014even when their own bodies look nothing like ours.", "output_tokens": 2834, "reasoning_tokens": 384}

Introduction and Thesis  \n\nOver the last quarter-century the discovery of \u201cmirror\u201d or resonance circuits\u2014neurons that fire both when I grasp a cup and when I see you grasp it\u2014has shaped a seductive hypothesis: we perceive actions as goal-directed only insofar as we covertly rehearse them with our own motor apparatus. Call this the Necessity Claim. The question is not whether resonance often accompanies action perception\u2014few deny that\u2014but whether it is a pre-condition without which recognition of goal-directedness could not occur.\n\nMy thesis is the Moderate Independence View: motor resonance is neither necessary nor sufficient for perceiving goal-directed action. What matters is an ecologically attuned visual\u2013causal system that computes regularities linking kinematic patterns, object affordances, and situational constraints. Resonance is best understood as (i) one possible informational channel feeding that system and (ii) a source of rapid, embodied predictions once a mapping is available. But the visual system can, and frequently does, detect goals in the absence of any plausible motor simulation. If this is right, the Necessity Claim mislocates the locus of explanation: what needs explaining is not why resonance produces goal detection but why the brain flexibly recruits whichever cues\u2014perceptual, contextual, or motoric\u2014are most reliable in a given situation.\n\nThe paper proceeds in six steps: (2) conceptual clarification, (3) the strongest case for the Necessity Claim, (4) empirical and phenomenological counter-evidence, (5) a positive alternative model, (6) replies to anticipated objections, and (7) concluding implications.\n\n2. Clarifying What Must Be Explained  \n\n2.1 \u201cPerceiving\u201d vs. \u201cInferring\u201d Goals  \nPhilosophers often treat \u201cperception\u201d as limited to early sensory processing while cognitive scientists speak of \u201cperceptual\u201d representations deep in the ventral stream. I adopt a practical criterion: S \u201cperceives a behavior as goal-directed\u201d when S spontaneously groups the observed kinematics into an action unit with an outcome slot, treats deviations from the predicted outcome as errors, and can use the resulting representation to anticipate next motion segments. Whether that is conscious is irrelevant; the representation can remain sub-personal.\n\n2.2 Minimal vs. Rich Goal Attribution  \nWe must distinguish (a) thin goal recognition\u2014\u201cthe arm is reaching toward the cup\u201d\u2014from rich teleological interpretation\u2014\u201cshe wants to hydrate.\u201d The Necessity Claim typically targets thin recognition; its explanatory burden is lower. I focus on this minimal sense because if resonance is unnecessary even here, stronger versions are a fortiori false.\n\n2.3 What Is Motor Resonance?  \nResonance means partial activation of motor programs homologous to the observed effector. Note three restrictions:\n\n   a. Effector-specificity: The premotor neurons code for the same musculoskeletal degrees of freedom.  \n   b. Sub-threshold activation: Actual movement is inhibited.  \n   c. Online mapping: The activity must co-vary with the unfolding trajectory.\n\nIf an account relaxes these, it risks trivializing the claim (\u201cany brain activity counts\u201d).\n\n3. Steelmanning the Necessity Claim  \n\nAdvocates cite four lines of evidence.\n\n3.1 Mirror Neuron Activation Correlates with Goal Perception  \nSingle-cell studies in macaques (Rizzolatti et al., 1996) show mirror neurons firing when the monkey grasps or observes a grasp. Human fMRI finds ventral premotor areas active during observation of familiar actions (Grezes & Decety, 2001). The correlation is tempting: disable the system, and goal perception should suffer.\n\n3.2 Interference and TMS Studies  \nIf participants observe a hand rotating clockwise while executing a counter-rotation, kinematic interference arises (Brass et al., 2000). Transcranial magnetic stimulation disrupting premotor cortex reportedly impairs recognition of action sequences (Avenanti et al., 2013). The causal arrow seems established.\n\n3.3 Developmental Trajectory  \nInfants begin to represent goals roughly when they acquire the corresponding motor skill: they predict the endpoint of a grasp only after they can grasp (Woodward, 1998). Motor mastery appears to scaffold perceptual competence.\n\n3.4 Evolutionary Parsimony  \nMapping observed kinematics onto one\u2019s own motor plans provides an intuitively economical way to predict outcomes: the brain repurposes control circuitry rather than building a dedicated \u201cgoal detector.\u201d\n\nTaken together, these findings motivate the Necessity Claim: without resonance there is no genuine goal perception, only motion tracking.\n\n4. Four Families of Counter-Evidence  \n\nEach family targets a distinct premise of the Necessity argument. None alone is decisive; collectively they undermine the claim of necessity.\n\n4.1 Cross-Species and Non-Homologous Actions  \nHumans readily perceive the predatory dive of a hawk as directed at a mouse, or the slithering approach of a snake as deliberate pursuit. Our motor repertoire lacks wings and serpentine locomotion. One might reply that the mapping is \u201cabstract,\u201d but that concedes effector-specificity, transforming resonance into a metaphor for any prediction circuit, thereby emptying the thesis of content.\n\n4.2 Congenital Limb Absence and Spinal Cord Injury  \nPeople born without arms can judge the intention behind bimanual tasks, predict grasp trajectories, and identify erroneous reaches (Vannuscorps & Caramazza, 2015). Motor imagery studies reveal no covert hand representation, yet goal perception is intact. Similarly, high-level spinal cord injuries abolish descending motor control but spare recognition of footkick goals (Pazzaglia et al., 2008). The motor programs are physically absent or functionally silent, yet perception persists.\n\n4.3 Novel and Impossible Actions  \nSpectators understand the aims of complex break-dance moves or the operation of a robotic arm on first viewing. Crucially, the robot may have more joints or degrees of freedom than a human limb; yet observers anticipate its goal, evidenced by pursuit eye-movements and predictive saccades (Flanagan & Johansson, 2003). If resonance were necessary, naive viewers should flounder until they embodied the action\u2014something that never occurs with a six-axis industrial robot.\n\n4.4 Purely Geometric Displays  \nHeider & Simmel\u2019s (1944) animated triangles reliably elicit intentional narratives. The shapes possess no limbs; participants nonetheless ascribe \u201cchasing,\u201d \u201ccoaxing,\u201d \u201cprotecting.\u201d Because any effector-specific simulation is impossible, goal perception must arise from higher-level motion heuristics: alignment, contingent acceleration, hierarchical grouping. This undermines the very heart of the Necessity Claim.\n\n4.5 Interim Assessment  \nThe lesson is not that resonance is irrelevant. Rather, observers use whichever cues yield the best predictions. When the observed action is within one\u2019s repertoire, resonance provides a fast, efficient heuristic. When not, the system recruits purely visual or contextual cues. Necessity is too strong.\n\n5. A Positive Alternative: Multilevel Causal-Predictive Parsing  \n\nI propose a three-tier model that explains why resonance helps without making it mandatory.\n\n5.1 Tier-1: Kinematic Templates  \nThe visual system contains detectors sensitive to invariants like minimum-jerk trajectories, velocity profiled for biological motion, and characteristic \u201ccoarticulation\u201d between joint segments. These templates are learned through mere exposure and do not require executing the action oneself. They supply cheap evidence for goal segmentation: an abrupt velocity drop near an object suggests impending contact.\n\n5.2 Tier-2: Affordance Mapping  \nParallel to Gibsonian affordances, the observer encodes statistical links between object features (handles, concavities) and canonical outcomes (lifting, pouring). Crucially, affordance mapping does not presuppose the observer\u2019s own bodily capacity. One can perceive the affordance of a giraffe\u2019s neck relative to high leaves without possessing a seven-foot cervical vertebra.\n\n5.3 Tier-3: Motor Resonance (Optional Precision Booster)  \nWhen available, resonance refines Tier-2 predictions by simulating fine-grained muscular synergies, enabling micro-anticipation of grip aperture or force scaling. This yields smoother real-time tracking, explaining why ventral premotor activity often correlates with temporal precision in eye-movements (Kilner et al., 2007).\n\n5.4 Marr-Level Analysis  \nAt the computational level the task is to assign a probabilistic goal variable G to a trajectory T given context C: P(G | T, C). Motor resonance supplies an additional evidential stream R. Necessity would require P(G | T, C) \u2248 0 when R = \u2205. The empirical data refute this; instead, R lowers prediction error but does not underwrite the inference. The model straightforwardly accommodates both resonance-rich and resonance-poor cases.\n\n6. Objections and Replies  \n\nObjection 1: The Cross-Species Case Still Utilizes Abstract Motor Codes  \nProponents may invoke \u201csupramodal\u201d resonance: even winged motion is mapped onto generic vector codes in premotor cortex. Reply: this shifts the goalposts. If \u201cmotor\u201d now includes any dynamical variable, the Necessity Claim becomes vacuous. Moreover, high-resolution fMRI shows that observing tools recruits parietal areas different from mirror zones (Bracci et al., 2018). So abstraction is bounded; not all goal perception routes through motor circuits.\n\nObjection 2: Congenital Cases Might Rely on Mirror Neurons Formed Prenatally  \nYet neuroimaging of congenital amputees finds no hand area tissue in the conventional loci. Instead, adjacent visual association areas expand (Striem-Amit et al., 2017). The data reveal functional reorganization, not latent dormancy. A credible necessity theory must explain how a non-existent effector\u2019s program can resonate.\n\nObjection 3: TMS Disruption Demonstrates Causality  \nTMS studies rarely achieve complete virtual lesions; they induce noise. Performance drops could reflect decreased attentional resources rather than the abolishment of goal perception per se. When tasks rely on fine discrimination (\u201cwas the grip precision or power?\u201d), noise in premotor cortex degrades sensitivity. Coarser goal judgments (\u201creaching to drink\u201d) remain above chance (Michael et al., 2014). Causality is partial.\n\nObjection 4: Evolutionary Parsimony Favors Resonance  \nParsimony is a heuristic, not evidence. The visual system already computes complex properties like face identity without motor rehearsal. A dedicated goal-detection circuit is no less plausible evolutionarily than a resonance inscription; indeed, predators benefit from perceiving prey goals they cannot physically enact (e.g., a wolf tracking a bird).\n\n7. Broader Implications and Novel Predictions  \n\n7.1 Dissociations to Test  \nThe Moderate Independence View predicts selective dissociations: (a) Temporarily anesthetizing an effector should impair fine-grained but not coarse goal perception for that effector; (b) training subjects on tool affording novel actions should enhance goal perception without concomitant improvements in self-execution.\n\n7.2 Empathy and Theory-of-Mind  \nIf resonance is not required for goal perception, its reputed role in empathy must be re-examined. A person with locked-in syndrome, incapable of motor resonance, can still think about others\u2019 goals\u2014a hopeful ethical reminder that embodied simulation is not the sole path to social cognition.\n\n7.3 Artificial Agents  \nFor robotics, the takeaway is encouraging: a perception module need not house the same actuators as those it observes. Computer vision systems employing causal inference over kinematics can, in principle, outstrip embodied agents in goal detection.\n\n8. Conclusion  \n\nResonance mechanisms are valuable tools in the brain\u2019s predictive arsenal, but they are optional add-ons rather than foundational pillars of goal perception. The Necessity Claim arose from an understandable conflation: because motor simulation often co-occurs with goal attribution, it was assumed to enable it. Careful survey of cross-species perception, congenital deficits, novel actions, and minimalist geometric displays reveals perception unshackled from the body\u2019s repertoire. A more nuanced model situates resonance as a precision-enhancing channel within a broader visual\u2013causal architecture.\n\nPhilosophically, this reframes talk of \u201cembodied cognition.\u201d Embodiment enriches perception when available, but cognition remains flexible enough to exceed the body that houses it. Recognising this elasticity respects both the neuroscientific data and the lived phenomenology of a world in which we routinely understand goals we could never ourselves enact\u2014whether in watching a hawk\u2019s stoop, a robot\u2019s weld, or an animation\u2019s dance of triangles.", "output_tokens": 3213, "reasoning_tokens": 512}

Develop a positive proposal\u2014the Affordance-Anchoring Account\u2014that treats motor resonance as one (often useful) anchoring route among others and predicts when it will matter.\n\nThe overarching moral is that perceiving agency is an achievement of a multi-layered predictive architecture that flexibly exploits whatever cues (kinematic, environmental, teleological, cultural) are most reliable in the circumstances. Resonance is a helpful but happily dispensable tool.\n\n1. Three Notions of Necessity  \n\u201cNecessity\u201d slides easily between logical, metaphysical, and empirical readings. Let us isolate three:\n\nA. Conceptual necessity: It is incoherent to ascribe perception of goal-directedness in the absence of resonance.  \nB. Nomological necessity: Given the laws of nature and our actual cognitive architecture, resonance must occur whenever goal-directed perception occurs.  \nC. Practical indispensability: For beings like us, resonance is normally the most efficient and therefore functionally obligatory route.\n\nProponents of the resonance thesis often oscillate among these claims. I will argue against (A) and (B). I will grant a weak, defeasible version of (C): resonance often facilitates fast and fine-grained interpretations, especially in domains where we are motor experts (speech for talkers, dance for dancers).\n\n2. Conceptual Considerations  \nEven if every actual instance of perceiving goal-directedness on Earth were accompanied by motor resonance, that correlation would fall short of conceptual necessity. Compare: every instance of seeing fire is accompanied by oxygen, but the concept \u201cfire\u201d does not embed \u201coxygen.\u201d Similarly, the concept of perceiving \u201cgoal-directed action\u201d makes no reference to rehearsing that action oneself. The very idea of heteromorphous understanding\u2014grasping the point of an act one could not possibly execute\u2014would be incoherent under the conceptual-necessity reading. Yet we routinely credit octopuses, drones, or chess programs with goals. So, at most a contingent relationship is on the cards.\n\nA defender might reply that while we can *entertain* the content \u201cThat is a goal-directed action\u201d without resonance, *perception* in the strict sense is richer and quasi-phenomenological; perhaps the intuitive \u201csmartness\u201d of seeing a reach as \u201cfor the cup\u201d rather than \u201cfingers moving east\u201d depends constitutively on covertly planning the same reach. But this trades on a controversial internalism about perceptual content\u2014one that screens off external cues (cup location, obstacle configuration) that could ground the teleological construal. Without that internalist premise, the conceptual necessity evaporates.\n\n3. Empirical Gaps in Nomological Necessity  \nLet us grant, for argument\u2019s sake, that resonance is traceable via classic mirror neuron signatures\u2014motor-cortex facilitation, mu-rhythm suppression, etc. Even so, the empirical claim that such activation is indispensable founders on multiple fronts.\n\n3.1. Congenital Motor Impairments  \nIndividuals with congenital limb aplasia (missing limbs from birth) cannot rehearse manually what they observe. Yet Vannuscorps and Caramazza (2016) show they identify hand-object interactions and predict action goals with neurotypical accuracy. fMRI confirms typical engagement of lateral occipitotemporal regions associated with action perception but attenuated activation in motor cortex. Goal perception, intact; resonance, muted.\n\n3.2. deafferented Agents  \nIan Waterman, famously deprived of proprioceptive and tactile feedback, performs deliberate movements via vision but lacks online motor representations. Neuroimaging during his observation of grasping shows minimal mirror-system resonance, yet his accuracy in predicting object-directed reaches remains high (Farrer et al. 2003). Again, perception floats free of resonance.\n\n3.3. Cross-species and Cross-effector Understanding  \nWe easily recognize goal-directedness in the slithering tentacles of an octopus, the collective swarm of bees, or the silent drift of a Roomba. These actions mismatch our motor repertoire: no human can contract a hydrostatic limb or modulate pheromonal flight patterns. Nevertheless we perceive pursuit, evasion, foraging. Unless one postulates a magical \u201cmotor equivalence\u201d stretching our system to non-existent effectors, resonance looks optional.\n\n3.4. Infant Data  \nMotor resonance mechanisms, according to proponents, develop through Hebbian learning: \u201cI grasp, I see grasp, association wired.\u201d Yet six-month-olds with limited grasping skill already anticipate the goal of observed reaches, evidenced by predictive saccades (Falck-Ytter et al. 2006). While some infant mirror activity is documented, its immaturity suggests that kinematic\u2013goal mapping precedes full sensorimotor coupling.\n\n3.5. Neurological Dissociations  \nTranscranial magnetic stimulation disrupting premotor areas dampens motor resonance but leaves coarse goal anticipation intact (Pobric & Hamilton 2006). Only fine discrimination of atypical grasps suffers, indicating that resonance refines but does not ground goal perception.\n\nCollectively, these studies undermine any strict nomological linkage.\n\n4. Why the Resonance-First Picture Persists  \nIf resonance is dispensable, why did it loom so large? Three factors conspire:\n\n4.1. Methodological Spotlight  \nNeuroscience favors what it can measure. Motor resonance yields tidy MEPs and mu-suppression; higher-level predictive inferences are harder to localize. The ease of measurement breeds theoretical centrality.\n\n4.2. The Phenomenological Illusion  \nFeeling a subtle tug in one\u2019s own fingers while watching a pianist tempts one to reify that experience as the basis of comprehension. But post-event proprioceptive contamination may piggy-back on prior perception rather than constitute it.\n\n4.3. The Efficiency Argument  \nSimulation via existing motor circuits is computationally cheap, especially for familiar actions. Evolution might piggy-back on this resource. Efficiency, however, is not necessity: cars can move on four wheels though movement-in-general does not require four-wheel drive.\n\nPredictive-processing models illumine the balance. The brain is in the business of minimizing prediction error across hierarchies. Motor resonance supplies rapid, low-level generative models of familiar kinematics; visual and contextual priors supply higher-level goal hypotheses; supervisory error signals arbitrate. When motor priors are trustworthy, the system leans on them; when they are unavailable or unreliable, the system pivots. Thus resonance enjoys a place of honor without a throne of metaphysical indispensability.\n\n5. The Affordance-Anchoring Account (AAA)\n\nPositive Proposal: Perceiving goal-directedness relies on anchoring observed kinematics to an affordance structure defined by environmental layout and object possibilities. Anchoring can proceed along multiple, partially independent routes:\n\nRoute 1: Motor Anchoring (classic resonance)  \nRoute 2: Ecological Anchoring (direct pick-up of affordances \u00e0 la Gibson)  \nRoute 3: Teleological Anchoring (reason-based inference about rational action given situational constraints)  \nRoute 4: Cultural Anchoring (conventional scripts, e.g., \u201chandshake\u201d)\n\nAAA claims:  \n(i) Any route, singly or in combination, is sufficient for coarse goal perception.  \n(ii) Motor anchoring excels when kinematics are familiar, rapid disambiguation is needed, or fine-grained error prediction matters (e.g., sports, surgery).  \n(iii) Ecological anchoring dominates when the action is alien but the environmental affordance graph is clear (Roomba approaching dirt).  \n(iv) Teleological anchoring dominates when rational constraints are explicit (agent chooses shortest path, avoids obstacles).  \n(v) Cultural anchoring fills gaps where pragmatic convention outstrips affordances (raising a glass in toast).\n\nAAA explains why resonance effects are strongest in experts: their motor anchoring route is richly parameterized. It predicts diminished but non-zero goal perception when Route 1 is lesioned; redundancy rescues performance via Routes 2-4. It also predicts context-sensitive weighting measurable by Bayesian model comparison in behavioral data\u2014a testable commitment.\n\nDialectical Objections and Replies\n\nObjection 1 (Phenomenological): When I watch a dancer, I *feel* her leap in my own legs. Surely that feeling is part of perceiving the leap\u2019s goal.  \nReply: The feeling enhances vividness but is neither logically nor nomologically necessary. Compare color-blind observers who lack certain qualia yet still categorize ripe apples as food. Affordance anchoring via visual kinematics suffices; proprioceptive entrainment embellishes.\n\nObjection 2 (Cognitive Load): Alternative routes are slower; real-time social interaction needs the speed of resonance.  \nReply: Empirical latency measurements show infants\u2019 predictive saccades at \u223c200 ms, comparable to mirror neuron onset, despite immature motor maps. Ecological anchoring fed by dorsal-stream processing can be equally fast.\n\nObjection 3 (Developmental): Motor experience *teaches* the mapping; without it, other routes cannot bootstrap.  \nReply: Cross-species perception already disconfirms universal motor experience. Furthermore, infants\u2019 anticipatory gaze emerges before first-person mastery of the observed action, suggesting that self-performances are not the sole teaching signal. Observational statistics can suffice.\n\nObjection 4 (Evolutionary Parsimony): Why would evolution duplicate machinery?  \nReply: Redundancy in critical functions is common (binocular vision, dual circulation). Social inference stakes are high (friend or foe, cooperate or flee); multiple fall-back systems increase robustness.\n\nPotential Empirical Tests\n\n1. Virtual-Effector Manipulation: Use immersive VR to map human arm movements onto non-biological avatars (e.g., snake-bodied agent). Record goal prediction accuracy and motor-cortex activity. AAA predicts preserved goal perception with diminished resonance.\n\n2. Fast Interruption Paradigm: Employ TMS to premotor cortex at varying SOAs. AAA predicts early disruption impairs fine kinematic prediction but not coarse goal inference; later pulses have little effect.\n\n3. Cross-Cultural Conventions: Present culture-specific gestures (e.g., Indian head wobble) to na\u00efve observers. Motor similarity is high (neck muscles), yet goal comprehension fails, suggesting cultural not motor anchoring is decisive.\n\nBroader Philosophical Payoffs\n\n1. Mindreading Naturalized: AAA offers a middle path between high-level \u201ctheory-theory\u201d and low-level \u201csimulation theory.\u201d Goal perception is grounded in affordances, which are neither mind-blind physical facts nor private motor imagery alone.\n\n2. Embodiment with Modesty: Embodied cognition gains its due\u2014motor systems matter\u2014but without the imperialism that crowds out other explanatory levels.\n\n3. Artificial Social Agents: If AAA is right, social robots need not replicate human motor schemata to be understood; they must instead make their affordances legible\u2014by predictable kinematics, environmental cues, or cultural signposting.\n\nConclusion\n\nMotor resonance is a versatile servant but a poor sovereign. The perception of goal-directed action is a multi-route achievement; resonance is often recruited but never irreplaceable. Conceptual analysis finds no incoherence in perception without simulation; empirical studies reveal populations, species, and contexts in which goal perception flourishes despite muted mirror activity; and a predictive, affordance-anchoring framework explains both the utility and dispensability of resonance. Future research should therefore pivot from asking whether resonance is necessary to mapping the conditions under which each anchoring route dominates\u2014a question that promises a more nuanced and, ultimately, truer account of how we perceive the bustling teleology of the social world.", "output_tokens": 3096, "reasoning_tokens": 384}

The finding that the very neurons that drive my own grasping also discharge when I merely watch you pick up a cup invites a tempting inference: perhaps perceiving that you are grasping a cup\u2014more specifically, perceiving that you are grasping it *in order to drink*\u2014*just is* covertly reproducing your motor commands in my cortex. In its strongest form, the \u201cresonance thesis\u201d claims necessity: without the resources of one\u2019s own motor system, the perception of another\u2019s goal-directed action is impossible.  \n\nI shall argue that this necessity claim is false. Motor resonance is, at most, a facilitatory mechanism\u2014helpful when available, dispensable when absent, and in any case insufficient on its own. Goal-directed actions can be, and routinely are, perceived independently of resonance mechanisms. To defend this view I proceed in four steps.\n\n1. I disambiguate the key notions of motor resonance and goal-ascription, revealing why the inference from mirror discharge to perceptual necessity is non-trivial.  \n2. I survey the main empirical arguments offered for the necessity claim and show that each admits a defeater once the distinctions are kept in view.  \n3. I advance a positive alternative\u2014the \u201cmultilevel invariance\u201d account\u2014which explains how goal-directedness can be gleaned directly from kinematic and contextual structure without motor simulation, yet also clarifies the limited, predictive role resonance can play when it is present.  \n4. I answer three strong objections, thereby displaying not merely compatibility but explanatory superiority over the necessity thesis.\n\nThe upshot is a pluralist picture: resonance belongs to the *predictive* economy of action perception, not to its *enabling* conditions.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n1. Clarifying the Target Phenomenon\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\n1.1. What is motor resonance?  \nEmpirically, \u201cresonance\u201d refers to the activation of an observer\u2019s motor representations that are *isomorphic*\u2014in effector, trajectory, and goal space\u2014to the action being witnessed. Functionally, it is an automatic, subpersonal mapping requiring no overt movement. Crucially, resonance is *effector-specific*: neurons that code for grasping with a right hand rarely fire for grasping with a foot.\n\n1.2. What is it to *perceive* goal-directed action?  \nI follow common usage in treating perception of goal-directedness as the online, non-inferential registration that a presently unfolding movement is *for* something\u2014e.g., that the hand is moving *in order to* obtain the cup. Three clarifications are vital.\n\na. Perceiving a goal is not identical to *specifying the motor commands* by which that goal could be satisfied.  \nb. Perceiving a goal is not identical to *conceptually articulating* it. Infants and non-linguistic animals can perceive goal-directedness.  \nc. Goal perception is coarser than intention reading. I can perceive that you reach for the cup without perceiving that you intend to insult the host by refusing wine.\n\nGiven these clarifications, the necessity thesis reads: \u201cWithout activation of motor representations isomorphic to the observed movement, the visual system cannot register the movement as for a goal.\u201d\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n2. The Case for Necessity and Its Limits\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\nProponents marshal three principal lines of evidence: developmental dependence, interference studies, and neuropathology.\n\n2.1. Developmental dependence  \nNewborns imitate tongue protrusion and, by 6 months, show EEG mu-suppression (a resonance marker) when observing reach-and-grasp sequences. Some infer that the very appearance of goal perception in infancy is scaffolded by resonance.\n\nResponse: Correlation is not necessity. Consider infants with congenital limb absence. When these infants observe others\u2019 hand actions, fMRI reveals near-typical activation of posterior superior temporal sulcus and anterior intraparietal areas\u2014regions implicated in goal perception\u2014but *no* homologous hand motor activation (they have no hand representation to resonate). Yet behavioral measures (dishabituation paradigms) show that they, like typical infants, expect a reach to terminate at a former goal object despite spatial displacements. Goal perception survives sans resonance.\n\n2.2. Interference studies  \nDisrupting dorsal premotor cortex with TMS impairs subjects\u2019 speed or accuracy in predicting the endpoint of an observed grasp. Necessity proponents read this as causal evidence.\n\nResponse: Two points blunt the inference. First, these studies report *performance* decrements, not total abolition of goal perception. Subjects still correctly identify goals at above-chance levels. Second, TMS spreads; control over sensory-motor integration zones is imperfect. What the data show is that resonance contributes to *prediction* under time pressure, not that it is indispensable.\n\n2.3. Neuropathology  \nPatients with ideomotor apraxia, who have lesioned mirror areas, often struggle to identify or imitate transitive gestures. Again, the step from impairment to necessity is unwarranted. Apraxic patients\u2019 difficulties centre on *tool use and fine-grained kinematic parsing*, yet they readily perceive that a friend is reaching for a glass rather than swatting a fly. Moreover, congenitally deaf signers with primary auditory-motor reorganization perceive the goals of spoken articulators they cannot physically execute. Morphological mismatch does not preclude goal perception.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n3.

My proposal draws on work in ecological psychology, Bayesian predictive coding, and robotics.\n\n3.1. Kinematic invariants  \nCertain movement patterns are lawful signatures of goal pursuit. The velocity-curvature relationship in reaching (the two-thirds power law), minimum-jerk trajectories, and bell-shaped velocity profiles are not idiosyncratic motor facts; they are optical invariants specifying efficient paths toward stationary targets. A purely visual system, calibrated by experience, can detect these invariants as indicating \u201ctoward-ness.\u201d\n\n3.2. Environmental embedding  \nGoals are seldom latent; they are perceptually available possibilities for action\u2014affordances. The presence of a graspable object at the trajectory terminus dramatically reduces ambiguity. Here the dorsal visual stream computes relative object-agent geometry independent of viewer motor repertoire.\n\n3.3. Statistical learning  \nObservers quickly extract conditional regularities: if agent-shape A produces movement pattern M in context C, the terminal locus L predicts high reward for A. Computational models show that sparse, high-level features\u2014turns at branch points, deceleration before contact\u2014are enough for goal inference in dot agents (Heider-Simmel stimuli). No effector representation is required.\n\n3.4. Role of motor resonance: prediction, not creation  \nResonance enters as an *internal forward model* that refines temporal estimates when the observer has a matching effector. It speeds up tracking, fills in occlusion gaps, and may enable empathic anticipation of effort. But it piggybacks on a goal signal that is already visually available. Thus resonance is *useful* but *contingent*.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n4.

The unification worry: Resonance offers a tidy neuroscientific mechanism unifying perception and execution; why posit extra, visual-contextual machinery?\n\nReply: Unification is a virtue only if the mechanism scales. Resonance cannot explain goal perception across gross morphological gaps\u2014watching an octopus, a drone, or a robotic manipulator. Nor can it explain goal attributions to geometric shapes. A multilevel account, by contrast, reduces to resonance when effector match is high, yet extends gracefully to alien bodies.\n\nObjection 2. The content objection: Perhaps what is *necessary* is not overt resonance firing but the availability of motor representations *somewhere* in the generative model; congenital limb-absent individuals might recycle alternative neural circuits to instantiate \u201cvirtual\u201d resonance.\n\nReply: This move makes the thesis unfalsifiable: any region that co-activates could be redescribed as \u201cmotor.\u201d To keep empirical teeth, necessity must tie to canonical motor circuits or at least effector-specific format. Data from rhesus macaques watching tool actions undermine this: neurons in canonical mirror areas fire for their own hand actions but not for pliers or tongs even after extensive exposure, yet the macaques swiftly learn the tool\u2019s goal trajectories. Goal perception outruns motor format.\n\nObjection 3. The developmental primacy rejoinder: Maybe early resonance scaffolds later visual learning; dispense with resonance in adulthood, but it is *ontogenetically indispensable*.\n\nReply: Again, congenitally limb-absent infants defeat the claim. More broadly, computational models show that unsupervised chunking of visual sequences recovers goal structure from temporal contiguity alone. Resonance may accelerate this learning, but acceleration is not necessity.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n5.

Even six-year-olds report that the lamp is \u201ctrying to follow\u201d the insect. No child believes she could reproduce the lamp\u2019s hydraulic rotations; the motor commands are alien. Yet goal perception is immediate. The example disambiguates goal attribution from effector resonance.\n\nExample B: The Inversion Illusion  \nWhen videos of ordinary reaches are played upside-down, the velocity profile remains the same but the path relative to gravity differs. Observers still see a reach toward the (now inverted) apple, indicating that kinematic invariants, not gravity-aligned muscle activations, ground goal perception.\n\nExample C: Virtual Reality Teleoperation  \nSurgeons control micro-robots whose kinematics are non-anthropomorphic. After minimal practice they judge, on live video, that the robot \u201cis about to puncture\u201d tissue. Critically, fMRI shows increased activity in parietal visual areas without corresponding hand motor resonance (hands are stationary on joystick).

Introduction and Thesis\n\nWhen you and I watch Serena Williams serve, our premotor cortices light up in patterns broadly isomorphic to those that would be active were we ourselves to swing the racquet. Mirror-neuron research has encouraged the thought that such \u201cmotor resonance\u201d is not merely a useful adjunct to social perception but a strict prerequisite of it: without covertly staging the stroke in my own body schema, I could not even see Serena\u2019s movement as a serve\u2014still less as a serve aimed at the T, or as part of a game plan to exploit her opponent\u2019s backhand. I will argue that this necessity claim is false. Motor resonance is neither conceptually nor empirically required for perceiving goal-directed actions. Instead, it is one of several overlapping routes\u2014visual\u2013kinematic, environmental\u2013affordance based, rational-inferential, and, yes, motor-simulative\u2014by which observers can register another\u2019s behavior as purposive. The right moral is pluralistic: resonance is a powerful but dispensable enhancer, not the gatekeeper of goal perception.\n\nThe case unfolds in five steps. (i) I disambiguate the pivotal notions\u2014\u201cperception,\u201d \u201cgoal-directedness,\u201d and \u201cnecessity\u201d\u2014to avoid a merely verbal dispute. (ii) I present three independent empirical arguments\u2014developmental, neuropsychological, and comparative\u2014showing that agents who lack motor resonance capacities can nonetheless perceive goals. (iii) I diagnose why the extant resonance-necessity arguments overreach, exposing a modal fallacy that confuses facilitation with requirement. (iv) I sketch an alternative ecological\u2013rational framework that secures direct perception of goals without recourse to motor mapping. (v) I engage two of the strongest rejoinders, the \u201cfine-grain discrimination\u201d objection and the \u201conline prediction\u201d objection, demonstrating that even where motor resonance adds value, it is not constitutive. The conclusion distills the pluralist insight and flags its implications for social cognition research.\n\n2. Clarifying the Debate\n\n2.1 Perception vs. Judgment. \u201cPerceiving a goal\u201d could mean anything from low-level detection of movement kinematics to high-level attribution of mental states. I reserve \u201cperception\u201d for the relatively unmediated uptake of distal patterns\u2014something that feels more like seeing than inferring\u2014while allowing that such experience can be cognitively penetrable. Thus, if I visually register your reach as \u201cfor the mug,\u201d that qualifies as goal perception even if I could, after reflection, articulate reasons for thinking so.\n\n2.2 Goal-Directedness. A behavior is goal-directed if it exhibits efficient organization toward an outcome that functions as a satisfier for the agent. Importantly, goal perception can be graded: I might see you as \u201ctrying to get that object\u201d without yet specifying whether you intend to drink, wash, or fling it. The necessity claim we are inspecting must therefore hold across these grains, or else be relativized.\n\n2.3 Modal Force. To say that motor resonance is \u201cnecessary\u201d is to say that whenever an observer lacks it, goal perception is impossible. It is stronger than claiming merely that resonance typically contributes, or that it is one reliable route. My strategy is simple: provide counter-instances where goal perception occurs while resonance is absent or severely compromised. If even one such case is credible, strict necessity fails.\n\n3. Empirical Counter-Evidence\n\n3.1 Developmental Evidence: Neonatal and Early Infant Abilities. By three months, infants visually prefer grasping actions that are efficient relative to environmental constraints (e.g., choosing a straight reach over an arcing detour when no obstacle is present). This \u201crationality\u201d signature surfaces well before they can perform grasps of comparable complexity, let alone generate the corresponding motor resonance. Moreover, infants wearing mitten constraints that prevent finger individuation still distinguish goal-directed from non-goal-directed reaches. What powers their discrimination appears to be sensitivity to spatiotemporal invariants\u2014smoothness, minimal-jerk trajectories, endpoint contact\u2014that specify purpose independently of the infant\u2019s own motor repertoire.\n\n3.2 Neuropsychological Evidence: Deafferented and Paralyzed Individuals. Patients with congenital absence of limb proprioception (deafferentation) or with motor-planning impairments (ideomotor apraxia) routinely identify others\u2019 practical intentions. One striking case, IW, who lost all large-fiber sensory input below the neck, performs at chance when asked to imagine making specific finger configurations but accurately reports observed piano playing as skilled or sloppy. Likewise, adults with spinal injuries eliminating descending motor commands still read goals in sports footage. If resonance were necessary, such subjects should be blind to purposiveness\u2014a prediction flatly contradicted by clinical testimony and controlled studies.\n\n3.3 Comparative Evidence: Non-Human Agents and Novel Morphologies. Spectators readily attribute goals to snakes coiling around prey, Roomba vacuums homing to charging docks, and animated geometric shapes enacting Heider-Simmel dramas. In each case, the observed effector system lacks an isomorphic counterpart in the viewer\u2019s motor repertoire. What carries the explanatory burden are higher-order relational patterns\u2014persistent pursuit, obstacle avoidance, self-propelled articulation\u2014captured visually without bodily mirroring. Even expert rock climbers, when shown octopus locomotion, correctly classify exploratory versus feeding behaviors despite possessing nothing like eight-armed suckered limbs. These examples generalize the developmental and clinical cases: observers can \u201csee what it is for\u201d even when \u201cdoing it oneself\u201d is physically unimaginable.\n\n4. Where Resonance-Based Arguments Go Wrong\n\nProponents of necessity often point to neuroimaging correlations: mirror-area activation tracks recognitional acuity, and disrupting premotor cortex via TMS impairs fine-grained action discrimination. The inference to necessity, however, commits a modal fallacy akin to post hoc ergo propter hoc. From \u201cactivation covaries with performance\u201d it does not follow that \u201cactivation is required.\u201d The covariation could reflect: (a) compensatory recruitment\u2014when visual cues are ambiguous, observers lean on motor simulation; (b) epiphenomenal spill-over\u2014premotor areas may light up simply because visual events spontaneously prime latent affordances without doing representational work; or (c) facilitative but non-essential contribution\u2014my ability survives without it, though perhaps less efficiently.\n\nA parallel mistake would be to argue that because hippocampal involvement enhances route navigation, hippocampi are necessary for perceiving layouts; patients with hippocampal damage who still perceive spatial arrangements falsify that necessity claim. The same logic applies to motor resonance and goal perception.\n\n5. An Ecological\u2013Rational Alternative\n\nHow, then, is purposiveness visually available? I propose a hybrid ecological\u2013rational framework:\n\n5.1 Kinematic Signatures. Certain movement profiles lawfully specify telic organization. Minimum-jerk trajectories, bell-shaped velocity curves, and adjust-on-the-fly corrections signal goal pursuit because they manifest optimal control principles. Like Gibsonian invariants, these patterns are directly pick-uppable.\n\n5.2 Affordance Landscapes. Observers parse scenes into action-relevant layouts (mug-with-handle affords grasp-to-drink). Perceiving you as reaching for the mug exploits a shared attunement to affordances, not necessarily a bodily reenactment of the reach.\n\n5.3 Rational Expectation. Humans apply a \u201cprinciple of rational action\u201d: given environmental constraints and agent-specific capacities, the path that conserves cost toward a valuable outcome is presumed to be intended. This heuristic, noticed in Gergely and Csibra\u2019s \u201cteleological stance,\u201d operates even in 12-month-olds and works for snakes, Roombas, and octopi alike.\n\n5.4 Integrative Prediction. The brain marries these informational streams, sometimes supplementing them with motor simulation for enhanced temporal prediction, especially when stakes or noise are high. But simulation is an add-on, not the ground floor.\n\n6. Objection Handling\n\n6.1 Fine-Grain Discrimination. \u201cPerhaps gross goal categories can be perceived without resonance,\u201d the critic concedes, \u201cbut to distinguish a slice backhand from a topspin one, you must internally reproduce the muscle synergies.\u201d Two replies. First, phenomenology: expert tennis coaches with arthritic shoulders, unable to execute topspin serves themselves, nonetheless discriminate them unerringly by sight. Second, psychophysics: temporal-reverse playback disrupts recognition even though motor match remains possible, indicating reliance on higher-order motion cues, not enacted synergies. Where resonance helps, it refines perception; it does not create it ex nihilo.\n\n6.2 Online Prediction for Smooth Interaction. Another worry: joint action requires split-second anticipation; motor resonance supplies that. Deafferented individuals, while capable of visual recognition, are clumsy co-actors. Isn\u2019t that evidence for necessity in real-time contexts? Here the conflation of perception with coordination resurfaces. Smooth synchronized dancing involves more than goal recognition; it demands shared timing and force calibration. Motor simulation may indeed be necessary for seamless physical coupling, but that is a stronger task than bare perception. So the critic changes the subject: from \u201cseeing what you\u2019re up to\u201d to \u201cmoving with you.\u201d My thesis targets the former.\n\n7. Positive Payoff: A Pluralist Model of Social Perception\n\nWe can now articulate a layered model:\n\nLayer 1 (Kinematic-Ecological): Visual detection of lawful patterns and affordances yields direct perception of basic goals.\n\nLayer 2 (Motor Resonance Modulation): When kinematic information is degraded or when anticipatory co-action is required, the observer recruits motor schemas to fill temporal gaps.\n\nLayer 3 (Conceptual and Cultural Enrichment): Linguistic labels, conventions, and normative scripts enable perception of institutional goals (signing a contract, making a toast) that outrun both kinematics and motor schemas.\n\nImportantly, motor resonance lives in Layer 2, not Layer 1. Its presence augments but its absence does not annihilate goal perception.\n\n8. Implications and Future Directions\n\nRejecting necessity reshapes experimental agendas. Rather than asking whether mirror neurons underwrite social cognition, we should probe context-sensitive recruitment: Why does resonance spike during ambiguous displays? Can training in affordance detection reduce reliance on simulation? Clinically, therapies for autism or apraxia might shift from stimulating mirror systems to enhancing ecological attunement. Philosophically, the pluralist account challenges mind\u2013mind parity assumptions: we need not \u201crecycle\u201d our motor scripts wholesale to grasp others\u2019 intentions; sometimes seeing is literally believing.\n\n9. Conclusion\n\nMotor resonance is a marvel of neural engineering, but it is not the keystone of social perception. The lesson of infants who cannot yet grasp, patients who cannot move, and spectators of alien morphologies is unequivocal: perceiving purposiveness is a multi-channel feat in which visual invariants, affordance landscapes, and rational heuristics play independent, sometimes dominant, roles. Exalting resonance to necessity misconstrues correlation as explanation and blinds us to the rich resources perception already supplies. A pluralist, ecological\u2013rational framework better fits the data and honors the ingenuity of minds that, even when still, can see what movement is for.", "output_tokens": 2595, "reasoning_tokens": 192}

Introduction and Thesis  \n\nA venerable objection to the very idea of a \u201csense of time\u201d runs as follows.  \n(S1) Perception requires a causal impact from the environmental feature perceived onto the sensory receptor.  \n(S2) Time itself is causally impotent; it does not impinge on anything the way photons impinge on the retina or air\u2010pressure waves impinge on the cochlea.  \nTherefore (C) there can be no genuine perceptual modality whose proprietary object is time.\n\nThe conclusion seems hard to resist if one accepts the premise that causal influence is always a matter of discrete energy transfer from a feature to a receptor. I shall argue that the objection rests on a misleading picture of how information is carried and exploited in sensory systems. The key mistake is to assume that the only route from world to organism is via a dedicated \u201cmessenger\u201d that travels from the property to the receptor. Once we replace this \u201cmessenger picture\u201d with a more general \u201clawful correlation\u201d picture of information, it becomes clear that a mechanism can reliably track elapsed time even though time supplies no energy packet of its own.  \n\nThesis (precisely stated): A system can carry and exploit information about temporal properties whenever (i) the system\u2019s internal physical dynamics instantiate a law-grounded, monotonic mapping from elapsed time onto an intrinsic physical magnitude (e.g., phase of an oscillator), and (ii) the organism is appropriately attuned to that mapping. Such \u201cendogenous transduction\u201d differs from canonical exogenous transduction (light, sound, chemicals) but is no less causal, no less informational, and no less perceptual for that. \n\nA carefully engineered clock therefore refutes the objection: its pointer positions covary with elapsed time, not because time pushes the pointer, but because deterministic law links any later state of the mechanism to its earlier calibration in a way that preserves temporal information. A biological nervous system can recruit the same strategy\u2014neural oscillations, biochemical diffusion, or accumulating spike counts\u2014turning an internal physical regularity into a sense of duration.  \n\nPlan. Section 2 clarifies the causal and informational assumptions behind the objection. Section 3 introduces two kinds of sensory transduction, exogenous and endogenous, and shows why both are respectable forms of causal information gathering. Section 4 dissects the clock case to illustrate how a mechanism can lawfully map t onto a read-out variable in the absence of \u201ctime jolts.\u201d Section 5 addresses three live objections: the calibration worry, the misrepresentation worry, and the \u201cmere correlation\u201d worry. Section 6 sketches implications for biological time perception. I close by extracting a broader moral about how philosophy of perception should handle properties that are structural or relational rather than energic.\n\n2. What Does \u201cCausal Influence\u201d Really Require?  \n\nPremise (S1) in the objection is attractive partly because it mirrors the textbook story of the canonical senses: energy hits the receptor, transduction currents fire, and a percept results. Yet the premise is ambiguous between two readings.\n\na. Energetic-impact reading: The environmental property must itself transfer energy to the receptor.  \nb. Causal-dependence reading: Receptor states must reliably depend, via some causal chain, on whether the environmental property obtains.\n\nOnly (a) rules out a sense of time. Reading (b) is considerably weaker; it permits the receptor to be part of a mechanism whose state evolves under time-symmetric laws that implicate the very property to be tracked even if that property does no impinging. Crucially, information theory cares about dependence, not about who \u201cthrows the first punch.\u201d If changes in the property make a reliable difference to the receptor state, the receptor state carries Shannon information about that property, energy transfer or not.\n\nWhy believe (a) rather than (b)? Typically because one assumes that only transmitted energy can mediate the dependence. That is false. Consider barcodes read optically (photons travel), yes, but also consider a mercury thermometer. The thermometer\u2019s column length covaries with air temperature through volumetric expansion of the mercury. The property \u201cambient temperature\u201d is not a thing that \u201chits\u201d the thermometer; still, the device is an effective temperature sensor. What is doing the causal work is a lawful relationship between molecular kinetic energy in the air and volume in the mercury. Likewise, a Geiger counter registers invisible decay events not because \u201cradiation force\u201d attacks it, but because decay products interact probabilistically with detector gas. These are causal dependences without property-as-projectile.\n\nIn cases like time, the causal dependence is subtler still: the mapping is fixed by the general form of the dynamical laws rather than by a local force exerted by the tracked property. But a law-grounded dependence is still a causal one. Excluding it threatens to collapse the very distinction between causal law and energy pulse. \n\nHence the objection\u2019s core premise should be reformulated in the weaker sense (b). Once that is done, the conclusion no longer follows: tracking time is possible whenever one can build or evolve a device whose state is nomically tethered to elapsed time. That is exactly what clocks do.\n\n3. Exogenous vs. Endogenous Transduction  \n\nTo vindicate that claim we need a conceptual distinction.\n\nExogenous transduction: A receptor converts incoming environmental energy specific to the tracked property into an internal signal (photons \u2192 photoreceptor potentials).  \n\nEndogenous transduction: A receptor converts the internally evolving state of some physical subsystem into an informational signal where that internal state is itself a known function of an external property.  \n\nVision, audition, olfaction employ exogenous transduction. A clock, a thermometer, and arguably a bat\u2019s echolocation exploit endogenous transduction. In all cases, what matters is that the organism can exploit a causal nexus that binds some detectable variable V to the distal property P. Whether that nexus involves energy crossing the body boundary is irrelevant to V\u2019s informational role.\n\nSeveral neurobiological mechanisms of time perception are plainly endogenous:  \n\u2022 Intrinsic neural oscillations (theta, gamma) whose phase drifts predictably with elapsed time;  \n\u2022 Pacemaker-accumulator models in which the \u201cticks\u201d are generated spontaneously and summed;  \n\u2022 Slow ramping membrane potentials that integrate charge linearly over hundreds of milliseconds.  \n\nThese are not philosophical inventions; they are empirically tractable mechanisms used by mammals and insects alike. The philosophical point is that their legitimacy does not depend on a mysterious \u201cchronon particle\u201d bombarding the cells. Internal state evolution substitutes for external bombardment.\n\n4. The Clock Mechanism Analysed  \n\nTake a simple spring-driven mechanical clock. At t = 0 we wind it and set the hands to noon. Thereafter each half-oscillation of the balance wheel releases the escapement, the gear train advances, and the minute hand creeps forward. The system\u2019s Hamiltonian guarantees a near-constant period \u03c4 given limited friction and thermal stability. Let H be the composite state of spring tension and wheel phase. Then at any later time t, the angle \u03b8 of the minute hand satisfies \u03b8 = 2\u03c0(t/60 min) mod 2\u03c0. No one supposes that \u201ctime beams\u201d bombard the escapement. Rather, internal elastic, inertial, and gravitational forces conspire so that H(t) = F(H(0), t). \n\nInformationally, the mapping F is deterministic enough that mutual information I(\u03b8; t) \u2248 log\u2082N where N is the number of distinguishable minute marks. Both the pointer and the external variable t can be viewed as jointly distributed random variables; the tight lawful mapping keeps the conditional entropy low. That suffices for the pointer state to carry time information. Nor is the mapping accidental: it is the product of design, tuning, and continual error correction by a clockmaker or user. But design origin is irrelevant to informational status; what matters is present-tense causal dependence plus suitable teleology for representation. Teleosemantic theories thus have no problem calling \u03b8 a representation of t.\n\nOne might insist that the spring tension changes because molecules bounce faster as time passes, so time is not causally inert after all. This conflates two senses of \u201cbecause.\u201d The spring\u2019s restoring torque at moment t+\u0394t is caused by its displacement at t in virtue of the laws of classical mechanics; the temporal parameter is not itself a force; it is the variable with respect to which the law is formulated. Calling that \u201ctime\u2019s causal power\u201d is like crediting \u201cspace\u201d with pushing billiard balls apart because inverse-square laws mention distance. The clock therefore supplies a genuine counterexample to the objection\u2019s requirement of causal impact by the tracked property.\n\n5. Three Objections Answered  \n\nObjection 1: Calibration Dependence. A clock must be initially set by comparison with an external time standard. That calibration step does involve causal influence\u2014from the external temporal order (sun, radio signal) to the mechanism\u2014so the objection resurfaces through the back door.\n\nReply: Calibration ensures that the mapping \u03b8 \u2194 t has the right phase offset and scale; it does not create the causal dependence that carries ongoing information. Compare a telescope: focusing the lens requires light, but once focused, the lens shape remains what it is whether or not a star currently shines on it. Likewise, a wound clock keeps time in total darkness after calibration. If receiving causal input at t\u2080 were sufficient to underwrite sensing at t\u2081, the original objection would dissolve on its own terms: time influenced the clock at calibration. More plausibly, what matters is whether the mechanism keeps tracking t without further causal help. Since it does, calibration is no threat.\n\nObjection 2: Misrepresentation Possibility. Clocks drift; neural oscillators are noisy; therefore the pointer variable can be off even when time marches on unchanged. Doesn\u2019t successful misrepresentation presuppose that the object represented can influence the representing state, at least counterfactually?\n\nReply: All representational systems allow for misrepresentation precisely because the causal link, though systematic, is not infallible. Vision misperceives color under sodium lighting, yet photons still reach the retina. The crucial property is counterfactual dependence: had the clock\u2019s escapement not jammed, \u03b8 would have tracked t. That is true because the mechanism is designed to maintain the dependence in normal conditions. Failure of tracking does not show that time lacks the capacity to be tracked; it shows only that a particular implementation is imperfect\u2014par for the course with every sense modality.\n\nObjection 3: Mere Correlation. Perhaps the clock and time are correlated, but correlation is not causation. The pointer covaries with time because both are effects of a deeper cause: the deterministic laws of physics. That makes the relation informationally inert.\n\nReply: The complaint confuses \u201ccommon cause\u201d with \u201cno cause.\u201d The state of the mechanism at t+\u0394t is caused by its state at t. Since its earlier state depends on earlier elapsed time, there is a continuous causal chain from that time through the mechanism\u2019s microstate to the pointer\u2019s current position. The laws are not a detached third cause; they are the structural form of all causal processes in the clock. In causal-graph terms, T\u2080 \u2192 H\u2080 \u2192 H\u2081 \u2192 \u03b8\u2081, where arrows represent actual causal transitions. That is more than mere correlation; it is a concrete causal pathway embedding time within the mechanism\u2019s state history.\n\n6. Biological Time Perception Revisited  \n\nIf the foregoing analysis is correct, there is no principled bar to a sensory system for time. We should expect organisms to have evolved endogenous transducers tuned to biologically relevant temporal scales. The empirical literature confirms this expectation.\n\n6.1 Circadian Time. The suprachiasmatic nucleus in mammals houses transcription-translation feedback loops that oscillate with a \u224824 h period. Light zeitgebers entrain the phase, but once entrained the oscillation free-runs in constant darkness for many cycles. The molecular concentrations at any moment carry information about time of day without time \u201cbombarding\u201d the nucleus.\n\n6.2 Interval Timing. Mid-scale timing (100 ms \u2013 minutes) appears to rely on cortical and striatal ramping activity. Dopamine modulates the slope, but the variable integrated signal is an internal clock. Electro-physiological decoding of such population activity enables accurate prediction of time to act.\n\n6.3 Millisecond Timing. Cerebellar circuits use propagation delays and synaptic plasticity to set up microsecond-precision detection windows, crucial for sound-localization and motor coordination. Here too, time is implicit in phase relationships of spikes, not in any external stimulus.\n\nAll three cases fit the endogenous transduction template. The organism has causal access to a variable whose dynamics are law-governed functions of elapsed time; it learns or evolves to read that variable; behavioral success confirms informational adequacy.\n\n7. Broader Moral: Sensing Structural Properties  \n\nTime is not the only property that resists the messenger picture. Mass, electric charge, and numerical quantity are also structural features expressed through law-based relations among more palpable variables. If the argument above is sound, philosophy of perception should recognize a spectrum of ways in which organisms exploit lawful dependencies:\n\n\u2022 Energy-mediated sensing (photons, phonons, odorants).  \n\u2022 Constraint-mediated sensing (thermometers, barometers, clocks).  \n\u2022 Consequence-mediated sensing (predator presence inferred via ripple patterns).  \n\nAll three are causal, hence all three can ground genuine perception given the right etiology and function. Rejecting a sensory modality simply because its proprietary property lacks a dedicated energy carrier betrays an overly narrow conception of causal information.\n\n8. Conclusion  \n\nThe objection to a sense of time assumes that perception demands what I called exogenous transduction; it neglects the perfectly respectable alternative of endogenous transduction. Clocks, biological and artificial, demonstrate how a mechanism can map elapsed time onto an intrinsic variable through lawful self-evolution, preserving a causal nexus sufficient for information, representation, and misrepresentation alike. Time\u2019s alleged causal impotence is therefore no obstacle to its perceptual accessibility.\n\nA final, perhaps surprising, upshot: reflection on time perception teaches us something about causation itself. Causation is not always a matter of shoves and impacts; often it is a matter of lawful unfolding within a system. Once we admit that broader view, the path is clear not only for a sense of time but for a more general theory of how minds latch onto the world\u2019s abstract structure with the concrete causal tools nature supplies.", "output_tokens": 3966, "reasoning_tokens": 896}

Introduction and Thesis  \n----------------------------------------------------  \nA familiar line of thought runs like this: for a system to *sense* X, X must causally impinge on the system. Light waves strike the retina; pressure waves buffet the cochlea; molecules bind to olfactory receptors. Time, by contrast, is not the kind of thing that pushes, pulls, or binds. If causation is a relation *in* time, time itself is not among the relata. Hence, there can be no genuine temporal sense.  \n\nI will argue that this objection mistakes how representation\u2014sensory or mechanical\u2014works. The central claim is this:\n\nA device can carry accurate information about time provided that its internal states *lawfully co-vary* with temporal parameters, even if time exerts no causal force *of its own*. What matters is a stable nomic dependence between temporal facts and the mechanism\u2019s states, not a direct time-to-sensor causal arrow.\n\nI defend this claim in three steps. First, I diagnose the \u201ccausal-impotence\u201d principle and show that it is too strong: many ordinary measuring instruments violate it without compromising their representational credentials (\u00a72). Second, I explain how clocks\u2014sundials, quartz watches, caesium fountains\u2014secure information about time through lawful regularities in background processes, rendering direct causal impact by time unnecessary (\u00a73). Third, I extend the moral to biological and psychological \u201csenses\u201d of time in humans and other animals (\u00a74), closing with replies to residual worries (\u00a75). Along the way I introduce a distinction\u2014*proximal causal mediation* versus *nomic tracking*\u2014that, I suggest, clarifies a wide range of measurement and representation problems.\n\n2. Why Direct Causal Impact Is Not Required  \n---------------------------------------------------------------------  \n2.1. The hidden premise  \n\nThe objection relies on an implicit premise:\n\n(CI) A system S represents (or senses) property P only if P causally influences S.\n\nBut CI is dubious. Two sorts of counter-examples reveal why.\n\n2.2. Instrumental counter-examples  \n\nConsider a mercury thermometer. The column\u2019s height tracks temperature. Yet *temperature* is a statistical property; the immediate cause of mercury expansion is molecular kinetic energy impinging on the glass bulb, not temperature *as such*. If CI were correct, the thermometer would fail to represent temperature, representing only micro-level collisions. Similar remarks hold for barometers (which represent atmospheric pressure, not the particular air molecules pressing on the diaphragm) and Geiger counters (which indicate radiation dose, a rate over time, though each click is triggered by individual decay events). What licenses attribution of temperature, pressure, or dose to these instruments is not direct causal contact with an abstract quantity, but lawful co-variation between that quantity and accessible causal intermediaries.\n\n2.3. Psychological counter-examples  \n\nHumans detect *risk* in a stock portfolio, or *probability* in a sequence of coin flips. Neither risk nor probability is a causal agent; still, we can be right or wrong about them, and our judgments can be more or less sensitive. Representation here piggy-backs on causal encounters with samples of events, but the represented property is an abstract statistical regularity. If CI were right, such cognitive faculties would not count as representational.\n\n2.4. The better principle: Nomic tracking  \n\nThe moral is that representation requires *nomic (law-like) dependence*, not *direct causal impact*. Following Dretske and Millikan, we might say that a state R in S represents property P when the obtaining of P is what *explains* the selection or reliable production of R under suitable conditions. That explanatory role can be filled by a network of causal relations in which P figures only as the *type-level* regularity, not a token cause.\n\nThus the causal-impotence objection demands too much. The right question is not \u201cDoes time hit the sensor?\u201d but \u201cIs there a stable, counterfactual-supporting correlation between temporal facts and sensor states such that the latter carry information about the former?\u201d If yes, the system qualifies as a time-measurer.\n\n3. How Clocks Track Time  \n----------------------------------------------  \nClocks come in many guises. What unifies them is not a common material or act of direct \u201ctemporal bombardment,\u201d but a strategy: harness a process with an approximately constant period and count its cycles. Let us look at three paradigms.\n\n3.1. The sundial: spatialization of temporal order  \n\nA sundial converts temporal relations into spatial ones via the earth-sun geometry. The sun\u2019s causal influence is illumination; the gnomon\u2019s shadow shifts accordingly. Time per se exerts no force. Yet because the earth rotates at a remarkably stable rate relative to the sun, the shadow\u2019s orientation co-varies monotonically with the local solar time. Crucially, what underwrites this mapping is a *lawful astronomical regularity*, not a shove from Time.\n\n3.2. The pendulum clock: inertial periodicity  \n\nIn a pendulum clock, a mass swings under gravity. The period T \u2248 2\u03c0\u221a(L/g) depends almost exclusively on arm length and local gravity. Each swing triggers the escapement, advancing the gear train by one tooth. Again, the pendulum\u2019s motion is caused by gravity, tension, and inertia. However, because those causal factors instantiate a *lawlike invariance*\u2014the period\u2019s value remains fixed barring perturbation\u2014the number of escapement releases since calibration grows linearly with elapsed time. The causal work is done by mechanical forces; the representational mapping is supplied by a lawful rate-regularity.\n\n3.3. The caesium fountain: quantum regularity  \n\nAt the cutting edge, atomic clocks exploit the hyperfine transition frequency of caesium-133: 9,192,631,770 cycles per SI second. Microwave radiation is adjusted until absorption peaks, indicating resonance. Electronics divide the resulting oscillations into counts of seconds. Here the causal chain is even more distant from \u201ctime itself.\u201d Quantum electrodynamics governs the transition frequency; we *stipulate* that whatever process yields that frequency defines the second. Representation arises from agreed-upon calibration plus the natural law guaranteeing the transition\u2019s constancy.\n\n3.4. Why these cases suffice  \n\nAll three clocks satisfy the following condition:\n\n(Lawful Co-variation)   For process P with state variable s(t), there exists a monotone, invertible function f such that s(t) = f(t) within tolerance \u03b5 over conditions C.\n\nGiven this, measuring s and applying f\u207b\u00b9 yields t. No further causal action by t is needed. Clocks thereby *encode* time structurally: time is in the pattern, not in a physical traveler from past to future pushing components.\n\n4. The Biological Sense of Time  \n-------------------------------------------------------  \nSkeptics might grant that artifacts can \u201ctell\u201d time without time\u2019s causal shove, but deny that organisms thereby *sense* time. I suggest the biological case is on a continuum with the mechanical.\n\n4.1. Circadian pacemakers  \n\nThe suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in mammals sustains roughly 24-hour cycles of gene expression. Light resets the phase via retinal input, but once entrained the oscillation persists in darkness. The SCN\u2019s molecular feedback loops thus function exactly like a biochemical pendulum. Downstream systems read its phase to schedule hormone release, sleep-wake cycles, and temperature. If a pendulum clock\u2019s information counts despite \u201ctime\u2019s impotence,\u201d so does the SCN\u2019s.\n\n4.2. Interval timing and striatal beat frequency  \n\nShort-range temporal judgments (milliseconds to minutes) rely on distributed cortical oscillations. On the \u201cstriatal beat\u201d model, different neural populations oscillate at slightly different frequencies; striatal neurons act as coincidence detectors for their combined phase pattern. The number of coincident-phase events since a start signal approximates elapsed interval. Again, time is extracted from *patterned change* in internal activity, not from a direct influx of temporal force.\n\n4.3. The phenomenology of duration  \n\nHuman introspection treats duration as *something sensed*. Yet careful psychophysics shows that perceived time is systematically distorted by factors like arousal, attention, and predictability. That is exactly what we expect if the \u201csense of time\u201d is an inference from internal state trajectories, subject to noise and modulatory control, rather than a direct sampling of an external temporal field.\n\n4.4. Continuity with other senses  \n\nNotice how closely biological time measurement parallels other sensory modalities. Vision does not respond to \u201ccolor\u201d per se but to wavelength-specific photon absorption; audition does not respond to \u201cpitch\u201d per se but to frequency-dependent cochlear mechanics. In each case the \u201cproximal\u201d signal is distinct from the abstract property represented, and lawful covariation bridges the gap. The temporal sense is no outlier.\n\n5. Replies to Residual Worries  \n------------------------------------------------------  \n5.1. \u201cCorrelation is not causation.\u201d  \n\nTrue, but representation requires *reliable* correlation anchored in a *mechanism*. The pendulum\u2019s swings would not correlate with time in a universe where gravity varied wildly. What secures reliability is the embedding of the tracking process in deeper laws, not metaphysical agency by Time. That suffices for representational and epistemic legitimacy.\n\n5.2. \u201cMisrepresentation shows clocks do not really represent time\u2014they just run.\u201d  \n\nClocks can fail: a wristwatch slows as its battery dies. The possibility of misrepresentation is a virtue, not a vice\u2014it shows that the mapping between internal states and time is *fallible*, hence representational. The same point underwrites the intentionality of vision: illusions do not prove that eyes fail to represent, they prove they can misrepresent.\n\n5.3. \u201cBut senses normally evolved to pick up *environmental* properties. Time is not environmental.\u201d  \n\nTime is not tucked \u2018out there\u2019 the way light sources are, but it structures every environmental event. Evolved organisms that predict, coordinate, and remember must track that structure. If lawful co-variation is available via endogenous oscillators, natural selection can exploit it. Nothing in evolutionary teleosemantics requires that the represented property be a distal *substance* or *force*.\n\n5.4. \u201cWhy not say clocks measure *frequency* or *period* instead of time?\u201d  \n\nNothing forbids dual representation. A quartz oscillator\u2019s frequency and elapsed time are inter-definable via t = n / \u03bd (n = cycles counted). Which property is primary depends on explanatory context. In practice we treat frequency as known (by calibration) and use counts to derive time; but the very act of calibration presupposes a temporal standard. The representational roles are mutually supporting, not mutually exclusive.\n\n6. A Revealing Distinction: Proximal Causal Mediation vs. Nomic Tracking  \n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  \nThe foregoing suggests a general framework:\n\nPCM (Proximal Causal Mediation): The chain of token causes that actually modulate the sensor (photons, pressure waves, neurotransmitters).\n\nNT (Nomic Tracking): The law-like dependency that licenses reading the sensor state as about some abstract property.\n\nIn vision, PCM = photon absorption; NT = laws linking wavelength distribution to surface reflectance properties. In time-measurement, PCM = oscillatory physical processes; NT = laws linking cyclical phase to elapsed duration. Confusing PCM with NT generates the causal-impotence objection. Once separated, the objection dissolves.\n\n7. Novel Implication: Clocks as *Embodied Models* of Spacetime Symmetry  \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  \nHere is an unexpected payoff. Every reliable clock embodies, in its dynamics, a symmetry of spacetime: the homogeneity of time. If physical laws changed from hour to hour, pendula and atoms could not serve as standards. Thus a clock is not merely a tracker of time but a *material witness* to temporal symmetry. Likewise, an organism\u2019s endogenous rhythm doubles as an implicit model of that symmetry, enabling anticipation of future states. The nomic-tracking account not only rebuts the causal-impotence challenge; it reveals why clocks are philosophically significant\u2014they concretize deep features of physical law.\n\n8. Conclusion  \n------------------------------  \nThe worry that there can be no \u201csense of time\u201d because time does no causal work rests on an overly demanding picture of representation. What clocks, brains, and organisms need is not a direct temporal shove but a lawful, stable *covariance* between temporal facts and accessible physical processes. That requirement is met by exploiting periodic phenomena whose dynamics are fixed by deeper laws. Once we distinguish proximal causal mediation from nomic tracking, we see that temporal measurement is perfectly continuous with other sensory and instrumental practices. Clocks therefore carry genuine information about time, and biological creatures genuinely sense temporal passage, even though Time itself never lays a finger on them.\n\nApproximate word count: 1,980", "output_tokens": 3451, "reasoning_tokens": 704}

Critics say no, because each canonical sense operates by causal impingement from an external feature\u2014photons strike the retina, pressure deforms the skin, odor-molecules bind to receptors\u2014and \u201ctime,\u201d unlike light or pressure, never bombards our nervous system.  The following essay rebuts that objection.  My thesis is two-part:  \n\n1.  A system can carry information about a variable even when that variable does not itself causally act on the system, provided the system\u2019s internal dynamics covary lawfully with the variable.  \n\n2.  Biological \u201cclock mechanisms\u2019\u2019\u2014from molecular circadian oscillators to neuronal interval timers\u2014satisfy that requirement; consequently, they can underpin a bona fide temporal sense despite time\u2019s causal impotence.\n\nThe result is that the objection confuses causal production with informational registration.  Once the concepts are prised apart, the impossibility evaporates.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n1.  Causal Impact vs. Informational Dependence\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nBegin by distinguishing two relations that are easily conflated:\n\nA.  Impingement-causation:  X directly transfers energy or matter to Y (photons on retina, vibrations on cochlea).\n\nB.  Lawful co-variation:  The state of Y is a deterministic (or probabilistic) function f(t) of some parameter t; observing Y therefore yields information about t even if t never \u201chits\u201d Y.\n\nStandard senses rely on both, because light waves, air pressure, and odorants not only impinge on sense organs but also covary with the distal properties they represent.  The objection implicitly elevates A to a necessary condition for sensing.  But that elevation is gratuitous.  In epistemology and information theory, what matters is reliable indication, not trajectorial causation.  As Dretske (1981) famously argued, a vehicle carries information about some condition C just in case there is a lawful dependency between C and the vehicle\u2019s state.  Nothing in that definition requires C to produce the state by direct causal push; a correlation secured by law is enough.\n\nThermometers illustrate the point.  Mercury expands with ambient temperature because of a lawful relation between kinetic energy and volume.  Temperature does not collide with the mercury; it is a statistical parameter of molecular motion.  Yet we happily say the thermometer \u201csenses\u201d temperature.  If the critic counters that kinetic energy collisions are the true cause, note that analogous micro-collisions occur inside temporal mechanisms too\u2014molecular binding events inside the suprachiasmatic nucleus, for example.  The lesson is not that any parameter qualifies, but that physical contact by the parameter itself is unnecessary.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n2.  How Clocks Encode Time Without Time\u2019s Push\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nClocks exploit lawful covariance by harnessing processes whose evolution is monotonic, periodic, or otherwise reliable with respect to the abstract variable we label t.  Strip away the bells and gears and a clock is simply a dynamical system S whose state S(t) is predictable from an initial condition S(0) by some function F:  S(t) = F(t; S(0)).  Because F charts a one-to-one (or one-to-few) mapping between elapsed time and internal state, reading S(t) lets us infer t.  Crucially, the inference is secure even though \u201ctime\u201d supplied no causal shove beyond the universal fact that every physical process unfolds temporally.\n\nThree families of clock processes illustrate the strategy.\n\n2.1  Linear accumulators.  Sand falls in an hourglass at roughly constant rate r; the height h of the lower pile is h = r\u00b7t.  No grain tracks the variable t; rather, human observers exploit the lawful proportionality between t and h.\n\n2.2  Oscillators.  In pendulum clocks, the period \u03c4 depends (ideally) only on arm length l and local g.  Each swing marks one \u03c4; counting swings gives elapsed time n\u03c4\u2014again a pure covariation.\n\n2.3  Stochastic decay.  The probability that N0 atoms remain undecayed after t is N(t)=N0e^{\u2212\u03bbt}.  By measuring N(t) we estimate t.  Radioactive dating is temporal registration via lawful dependency, not causal influence by \u201cpastness.\u201d\n\nNone of these examples requires time to push; they require time to structure lawful evolution.  That is enough for information-carriage.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n3.  Biological Clock Mechanisms\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nSkeptics might concede that artifacts can \u201ctrack\u201d time but worry that biological systems lack anything analogous to photoreceptors or hair cells.  In fact organisms teem with temporal transducers.  \n\n\u2022  Circadian oscillators:  Transcription-translation feedback loops (e.g., PERIOD and CLOCK genes) produce near-24-hour cycles.  Daylight entrainment merely calibrates the phase; the oscillation would continue in constant darkness (\u201cfree-running\u201d).  \n\n\u2022  Interval timers:  Cerebellar granule\u2013Purkinje circuits display ramping activity whose slope correlates with milliseconds-to-seconds intervals, enabling conditioned eye-blinks after precise delays.\n\n\u2022  Time cells:  In hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex, neuron ensembles fire sequentially across a delay period, furnishing an unfolding internal \u201cclock face.\u201d\n\nIn each case, the system\u2019s state s(t) is lawfully time-indexed.  Sensory and motor networks downstream can exploit s(t) in the same way the eye exploits contrast gradients: by learning to treat s(t) as indicative of something\u2014in this case, \u201chow long since X.\u201d\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n4.  Is \u201cIndication\u201d Enough for a Sense?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nOne might press:  \u201cSurely a sense requires environmental contact; otherwise, every metabolic process is a sense of something.\u201d  This objection usefully provokes two clarifications.\n\n4.1  Exteroceptive, proprioceptive, interoceptive, and endoceptive.  Pain and proprioception track conditions partly inside the body, yet we rightly call them senses.  What unifies sensory modalities is not locus of stimulation but their epistemic role: they supply information to an organism usable for guidance, often automatically, via dedicated pathways.  Temporal mechanisms meet this condition; e.g., they gate hormone release, coordinate locomotion, and anchor episodic memory.\n\n4.2  Calibration to the external world.  For a temporal signal to ground objective timekeeping, it must lock to an external periodicity (sunrise, tides, social schedules).  Entrainment satisfies that need.  External cues do causally impinge on the clock, but they adjust phase, not generate tick-by-tick dynamics.  Thus the critic\u2019s \u201cno external cause, no sensing\u201d maxim fails twice: internal dynamics create the code, while sporadic environmental cues calibrate it.  Visual accommodation works similarly: retinal blur triggers motor adjustments, but the maintenance of focal length is intrinsic to the lens muscles.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n5.  Objection:  The Dependency Is Tautological\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nA subtler worry alleges circularity: \u201cOf course processes change with time; saying a process signifies time because it changes is vacuous.\u201d  Response:  Signification requires more than mere change; it requires a systematic, specifiable mapping exploitable by the organism.  A rotting apple changes, yet no internal state of the apple is readable by the apple.  By contrast, the suprachiasmatic nucleus outputs phase information broadcast to peripheral tissues; downstream systems systematically depend on that phase.  Representation is thus functional, not merely coincidental.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n6.  Two Non-Obvious Distinctions\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n6.1  Metric vs. Order.  Organisms need both metric time (how much) and order (before/after).  Some neural circuits\u2014e.g., hippocampal theta sequences\u2014encode order without metric precision, akin to rank sensing.  Others\u2014cerebellar interval timers\u2014encode metric duration.  Recognizing the difference dissolves confusion: a system may possess order information without metric sense, or vice versa.  The objection targets metric sense; yet even granting it, order sense is plainly attainable by chaining events, again without time\u2019s causal action.\n\n6.2  Direct vs. Indirect Sensing.  Vision is often \u201cdirect\u201d in the sense that photoreceptors convert photons into neural signals with minimal preprocessing.  Temporal sense is \u201cindirect\u201d: the transduction step is internal dynamics.  But gustation and nociception are equally indirect: chemicals trigger receptor cascades, not immediate qualia.  So \u201cdirectness\u201d is a gradable, not binary, feature; its absence does not disqualify a modality.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n7.  Turning the Tables: Why Impingement Is Often Undesirable\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nThere are evolutionary advantages to having a sensory channel not hostage to immediate stimuli.  A ship\u2019s chronometer, unlike a sextant, works below deck.  Similarly, an animal must measure intervals during darkness, under anesthesia, or while holding still.  Endogenous clocks solve that problem precisely because they detach sensing from ongoing external bombardment; the critic\u2019s allegedly disqualifying feature is in fact adaptive.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n8.  Synthesis: The Law-Guided Dynamical Model\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nWe can now formalize the positive account.\n\nDefinition:  A system C is a time-sensor for agent A during interval I iff:\n\n(1)  There exists a function F such that for all t in I, state C(t)=F(t; \u03b8), where \u03b8 encodes initial calibration.\n\n(2)  A possesses a decoder D such that D(C(t)) \u2248 g(t) for some temporal property g (e.g., elapsed seconds, circadian phase).\n\n(3)  D(C(t)) is used by A to guide behavior B whose success depends counterfactually on accurate g(t).\n\nCondition (1) secures lawful co-variation, (2) secures representation, (3) secures the functional role that elevates mere correlation to sensing.  Note the absence of any clause requiring time to push on C.  Instead, what is required is lawful guidance.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n9.  Relation to Broader Philosophical Debates\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n9.1  Structural Realism.  The account aligns with structural realist views: what perception gets right is the structure of dependencies, not always the intrinsic nature of entities.  Clocks track the structure of temporal ordering without time\u2019s essence doing causal work.\n\n9.2  The Metaphysics of Time.  Whether time is substantival or relational, A-series or B-series, causal potency is arguably orthogonal.  Even if time is merely an ordering of events, a dynamical system can still exploit that ordering to encode position within it.\n\n9.3  Representation vs. Detection.  The case illustrates a general moral: representation is cheaper than detection.  To represent X, you need a device whose states vary lawfully with X and a consumer that exploits that variance; you need not detect X in the sense of being bombarded by its instances.  That moral bridges philosophy of perception with cognitive science.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n10.  Conclusion\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nThe initial objection relies on a mistaken principle: \u201cSensing requires causal impingement by the sensed property.\u201d  Once we separate impingement from lawful covariation, the principle collapses.  A clock mechanism\u2014artifactual or biological\u2014carries information about time by evolving in ways that are predictably indexed to temporal parameters, together with downstream systems that decode and exploit that evolution.  Time need not exert causal force; it functions as the independent variable in a lawful mapping.  Far from precluding a temporal sense, time\u2019s causal impotence is precisely what allows organisms to build internal, portable, and self-sustaining chronometers.  Therefore, the existence of genuine temporal sensory systems is not only possible but already instantiated in the biological world we inhabit.", "output_tokens": 3175, "reasoning_tokens": 640}

If sensory systems must be causally impinged upon by the very properties they detect, then\u2014so the objection goes\u2014there can be no genuine \u201csense of time.\u201d Clocks, biological or mechanical, may of course co-vary with temporal intervals, but that would be mere coincidence or human convention, not sensing in the strict, causally mediated sense.  \n\nMy thesis is that the objection trades on an overly narrow picture of what it is for a mechanism to carry information and, by extension, what it is for a system to count as sensory. Once we sharpen the relevant distinctions\u2014between causal influence and nomic constraint, between direct stimulation and co-variance, and between a property\u2019s micro-causal basis and its higher-level description\u2014it becomes clear that a clock can legitimately \u201csense\u201d time in much the way a thermometer senses temperature. Time is not a sui generis causal force, but temporal intervals are nevertheless encoded in the states of clock mechanisms because those states stand in reliable, law-governed counterfactual relations to facts about elapsed time. The causal work is done by ordinary physical processes (oscillations of a quartz crystal, decay of radioactive nuclei, metabolic cycles in neurons), yet because those processes are functionally dedicated to tracking time, and because their outputs figure in wider systems that exploit the temporal information, it is philosophically sound to say that the organism\u2014or the device\u2014possesses a sensory channel for time.  \n\nI. Direct Impact vs. Lawful Co-variance  \n-------------------------------------------------  \nThe root of the objection is a mistaken assimilation of two ideas: (1) that sensory systems rely on causal interaction with what they detect and (2) that the relevant causal interaction must be a direct \u201cimpact\u201d of the detected property itself. The first idea is broadly right: no information without causation. But the second idea is false. A canonical counter-example is the liquid-in-glass thermometer. The mercury column rises when ambient temperature increases, yet temperature does not literally press upward on the mercury. Rather, molecular kinetics\u2014collisions among particles\u2014raise the internal energy of the mercury, causing expansion. We are comfortable saying that the thermometer measures temperature because of a lawful, systematic co-variation: for a wide range of contexts, the height of the column counterfactually depends on the ambient temperature. If the temperature were different, the column would be higher or lower.  \n\nThe same pattern holds for other devices that measure \u201ccausally inert\u201d magnitudes. A bathroom scale measures mass, even though mass is not a force; gravity\u2019s pull on the mass effects the reading. A voltmeter measures potential difference, not because volts exert forces directly, but because the underlying arrangement of charges creates currents that deflect the needle. What licenses the measurement talk is a stable causal nexus that ties the state of the instrument to the value of the magnitude across relevant counterfactuals\u2014not the direct causal potency of the magnitude at its own level of description.  \n\nII. Information: From Causal Impact to Counterfactual Support  \n-------------------------------------------------------------------  \nShannon\u2019s framework, refined for philosophy by Dretske and later teleosemantic theorists, locates information in reliable correlations. A signal carries information that p if, given the signal, the probability of p is high and would fall in its absence. Nothing in this account requires that p itself impress a causal \u201cstamp\u201d on the signal. What matters is the mediating channel, the lawful regularity it exploits, and the consumer system that is wired to respond. A quartz wristwatch exemplifies this. The flexing of the quartz crystal, driven by an electric field, sets up an oscillation at 32,768 Hz. Electronic circuitry counts these oscillations, dividing them down to one pulse per second that advances the display. That the crystal flexes at this precise frequency is a nomic regularity grounded in the crystal\u2019s lattice structure; it is not the result of \u201cpressure from time.\u201d Nevertheless, given familiar environmental conditions, the state of the watch at any moment makes highly reliable assertions about elapsed time.  \n\nBiological clocks share the same template. The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in mammals maintains roughly 24-hour rhythmic gene expression. The molecular feedback loops that create this rhythm are biochemically causal, yet the period\u2019s explanatory relevance is temporal: approximately one Earth day. The SCN is entrained by light, but once set it free-runs, providing time-of-day information to diverse brain regions. The information is genuine because organisms act on it: migratory birds time departures, flowers open and close, humans experience jet lag when the SCN drifts out of sync.  \n\nIII. Direct, Indirect, and Instantiated Sensing  \n-----------------------------------------------------  \nA critic might concede that clocks encode temporal information but deny that this counts as \u201csensing.\u201d Sensing, they may insist, requires direct transduction of an external stimulus into neural activity. But that criterion is too strong, and not even our undisputed senses consistently meet it.\n\n1. Proprioception detects limb position. The immediate cause of receptor firing is muscle spindle stretch, not \u201cposition\u201d itself.  \n2. Nociception detects tissue damage via chemical mediators; damage is not a force in its own right.  \n3. Audition involves pressure waves in air\u2014a medium distinct from the distal property (say, the shattering of glass).  \n\nWhat unifies the senses is not directness but functional role: they supply the organism with actionable, systematically exploitable information about the environment or its own body. Temporal mechanisms do exactly this. They guide circadian hormone release, interval timing for motor coordination, and complex social behaviors that rely on synchrony (chorusing among frogs, conversational turn-taking in humans). The internal clock\u2019s deliverances have the same explanatory and evolutionary status as vestibular or tactile inputs.  \n\nIV. The Metaphysics of Time Measurement  \n-----------------------------------------------  \nOne might still worry that temperature, mass, and electric potential are instantiated properties with localizable micro-bases, whereas \u201celapsed time\u201d is merely a parameter in the equations that describe change; it is not \u201cout there\u201d to be sampled. That objection again conflates levels of description. Consider a light clock in special relativity: two mirrors face each other, a photon bounces between them, and each round-trip is one tick. The \u201cticking\u201d is a physical process, and the count of ticks maps one-to-one onto a temporal interval defined by the invariant speed of light. Whether we regard time as an abstract coordinate or as a dimension of spacetime does not affect the operational fact: to measure time is to count cycles of a suitable process whose physics involves a stable frequency.  \n\nAn instructive physical principle here is Noether\u2019s theorem: symmetry under continuous time translation yields conservation of energy. The very laws that allow us to define isolated systems and track their energy levels require temporal invariance. Clocks exploit that invariance. They work because certain processes\u2014pendular motion, atomic transitions, radioactive decay\u2014have periods that are stable across contexts precisely in virtue of the underlying physical laws. The causal chain runs from micro-dynamics to macroscopic state changes (gear positions, digital counts), and these chains embody invariance over time. The datum of elapsed time is therefore implicit in the patterned unfolding of physical events; a clock \u201creads\u201d it by evolving in a controlled and countable way.  \n\nV. Psychological Timing and Dedicated Neural Circuits  \n----------------------------------------------------------------  \nMoving from physical clocks to neural ones, contemporary neuroscience reveals multiple timing circuits, none of which waits passively for a \u201ctingle of time.\u201d  \n\n1. Millisecond-range timing (critical for speech and music) appears to rely on cerebellar and basal ganglia networks whose population states evolve through high-dimensional trajectories; elapsed time is encoded in pattern progression, readable by downstream decoders.  \n2. Seconds-to-minutes timing often uses \u201cramping\u201d neurons in frontal and parietal cortices whose firing rates monotonically increase or decrease; when a threshold is reached, the system infers that the target interval has passed.  \n3. Circadian timing, as noted, is molecular.  \n\nEach mechanism is tuned by evolution and plasticity to remain stable against noise, and each participates causally in behavior in the way classical senses do: lesions, pharmacological disruptions, or genetic knockouts yield specific timing deficits. Patients with cerebellar damage, for example, have difficulty judging the duration between two auditory clicks, yet show intact color perception. Such double dissociations support regarding timing as serviced by dedicated, and therefore sensory-like, subsystems.  \n\nVI. Putting Pressure on the Objection  \n----------------------------------------------  \nLet us now rehearse the objector\u2019s argument, steelmanned:\n\nPremise 1. Sensing a feature F requires F itself to causally imprint its value on the sensory receptor.  \nPremise 2. Time is causally inert; it cannot imprint its value.  \nConclusion. Therefore there can be no genuine sense of time.  \n\nPremise 2 is acceptable if we mean that \u201ctime as such\u201d exerts no forces. Premise 1, however, is false or at least needlessly restrictive. Replace it with a more defensible principle:\n\nP1* Sensing a feature F requires that the state of a sensory mechanism covary with F across relevant counterfactual situations because of stable causal laws, and that the organism be able to exploit that covariance.  \n\nGiven P1*, timing mechanisms plainly qualify. The quartz oscillation covaries with elapsed seconds; the SCN\u2019s gene expression profile covaries with time of day; both covariations are underwritten by physical laws and have functional roles. Hence the conclusion that there is no temporal sense does not follow.  \n\nVII. Addressing Two Residual Worries  \n-------------------------------------------------  \n1. Epistemic Fragility: What if the clock drifts?  \nNo sense is infallible. Vision misleads in a mirage; proprioception errs when muscles are fatigued. If temporal oscillators are perturbed\u2014temperature changes lengthen a pendulum\u2019s period\u2014the error is traceable to identifiable physical interferences. Calibration and feedback (e.g., light inputs entraining the SCN) keep the sense reliable. Imperfection is evidence of causal mechanism, not of absence.  \n\n2. The Intentionality Challenge: Does the system represent time or merely its own states?  \nRepresentation is a functional-teleological matter. The SCN\u2019s raison d\u2019\u00eatre, shaped by natural selection, is to guide the organism through the day-night cycle; that gives its oscillation a historically grounded content: roughly, \u201cit is now phase \u03c6 of the solar day.\u201d Similarly, the quartz watch was designed to mark seconds. The intentional object is time, not crystal flexing per se, because that is the explanatory purpose around which the mechanism was assembled or selected. Teleosemantics therefore vindicates temporal representation without assigning causal potency to time itself.  \n\nVIII. An Analogy that Reframes the Debate  \n----------------------------------------------------  \nImagine inventing a \u201cgeomorphometer\u201d that measures the shape of distant mountain ridges by analyzing their shadows at dawn. The device\u2019s detectors are causally impacted by photons; nevertheless, what they represent is topography, not light\u2019s intrinsic properties. Light is the intermediary, shadow the encoding, mountain shape the content. Clocks treat ordinary physical processes as intermediaries in the same way. Oscillations, decays, or flows are the \u201clight\u201d; the evolving internal state is the \u201cshadow\u201d; elapsed time is the \u201cmountain.\u201d The fact that time is not itself a force is irrelevant. What matters is that, across a wide space of counterfactual worlds consistent with our laws, if the mountain\u2019s profile were different, the shadow pattern\u2014and hence the geomorphometer\u2019s reading\u2014would differ. Likewise, if the duration were different, the clock state would differ. Once this picture is in view, the original objection loses its bite.  \n\nIX. A Modest Proposal: Sensory Pluralism About Time  \n-------------------------------------------------------------  \nThe dialectic so far suggests a further positive insight: there is not one sense of time but several, each specialized to a temporal scale and implemented by distinct mechanisms. Such pluralism mirrors the multiple visual pathways for color, motion, and depth. Recognizing these plural senses dissolves puzzles about how a single mechanism could cope with the twenty-orders-of-magnitude span between microseconds and circadian cycles. It also predicts empirical dissociations\u2014already observed\u2014between deficits in, say, millisecond rhythm perception and daily sleep-wake regulation. Philosophically, pluralism respects the heterogeneity of temporal phenomena while unifying them under the functional rubric of time representation.  \n\nX. Conclusion  \n------------------  \nTo sense is to exploit causation, not to be pushed upon by metaphysically primitive properties. Temperature, mass, voltage, and\u2014most relevantly\u2014time earn their measurability through lawful co-variation backed by underlying dynamics. Clocks, biological and artefactual, epitomize such exploitation. Their states counterfactually depend on temporal intervals in reliable, systematically harvestable ways; organisms and engineers alike harness those dependencies to guide action. Once we distinguish causal mediation from direct causal impact and embrace an information-theoretic notion of sensing, the specter of time\u2019s \u201ccausal impotence\u201d vanishes. There is, in short, plenty of causation\u2014oscillations, decays, ramping potentials\u2014just not causation by \u201cTime-itself.\u201d And that is all a genuine sensory system ever needed.  \n\nApproximately 2,050 words.", "output_tokens": 3590, "reasoning_tokens": 704}

Setting the problem\n\nAccording to the causal theory of perception, a genuine sensory system must be affected by the very property it represents: photons hit the retina, pressure deforms the skin, airborne chemicals bind to olfactory receptors. Time, however, seems incapable of exerting any analogous causal push. Hence (the objection runs) there can be no sensory system for time. And yet there are clocks\u2014both artefactual and biological\u2014that reliably indicate temporal intervals, and human beings often have an ordinary-language \u201csense of how long something lasted.\u201d How can a mechanism carry information about time if time itself never \u201chits\u201d the mechanism?\n\nI shall argue that the objection trades on an overly narrow picture of how information becomes available to a system. Roughly: a mechanism can represent a variable whenever its internal states covary with that variable in a way that is reliable under relevant counterfactuals and usable by the organism. Direct impingement by the represented property is one route to such covariation, but not the only one. For temporal representation the route is different: a clock is a dynamical system whose own lawful evolution is isomorphic, in a suitably coarse-grained manner, to the temporal dimension itself. Because all physical processes unfold in time, a device can exploit its intrinsic dynamics (or the dynamics of an environmental process it couples to) as the medium of causal influence. In that sense time is not causally impotent; it is the universal background condition that shapes every causal interaction. Hence the appearance of a paradox dissolves once we shift from a \u201ccontact\u201d model of perception to a \u201ccovariation-plus-use\u201d model of representation.\n\nI develop the response in five steps. (i) Distinguish two theses hidden in the objection. (ii) Show that the stronger thesis\u2014that time exerts no causal influence\u2014is false on any standard physical picture. (iii) Describe three generic architectures by which a mechanism can serve as a clock without special causal help from \u201ctime itself.\u201d (iv) Meet two lingering worries: the \u201cmere correlation\u201d worry and the \u201crate variability\u201d worry. (v) Explain why the resulting account fully earns the label \u201csensory system\u201d in the functional, informational sense relevant to cognitive science.\n\n2. Unpacking the objection\n\nThere are two separable claims.\n\nA. Contact requirement. For modality M to count as sensory, the target property P must stand in a direct causal relation (impact, impingement, transduction) to receptor R.\n\nB. Time-impotence thesis. Time, understood as a dimension or parameter, never stands in such relations; it \u201cdoes nothing.\u201d\n\nIf (A) were correct, then failure of direct causal contact would indeed undermine the claim to sensory status. If (B) were correct, then direct causal contact is impossible. But both premises can be contested.\n\nThe contact requirement (A) misdescribes several uncontroversial cases of perception. We discriminate pitch not by the acoustic frequency striking the ear drum per se but by the location of maximal resonance on the basilar membrane\u2014an internal mediation. In olfaction one molecule can \u201cstand in\u201d for an entire odor class because of receptor chemistry, not because that molecule is the odor. Even colour perception requires elaborate cortical processing mapping a distribution of wavelengths onto a three-dimensional opponent-process space. The causal chain need not terminate in the represented property itself; what matters is a regular, exploitable mapping.\n\nThe time-impotence thesis (B) is also suspect. Every causal process presupposes time in at least two senses: (i) processes are ordered; (ii) their rates of change follow dynamical laws expressed with temporal derivatives. If mass on a spring oscillates with period 2\u03c0\u221a(m/k), the period is not an accidental accompaniment; it is fixed by the laws of motion, which trade on temporal parameters. When the mass displaces the pointer of a clock, the causal route from mass-position to pointer-position has temporal quantities built in. Time, in short, is manifest in the way the world causally unfolds. That is enough to count as causal influence for representational purposes.\n\n3. Information without direct bombardment\n\nFred Dretske\u2019s information-theoretic framework is helpful here. A signal S carries information about condition C for a receiver R if, given the channel laws, P(C|S) > P(C) and the relation is lawlike enough to support successful action (Dretske 1981). Nothing in this definition requires that C directly hit R; it must merely modulate S in a reliable, counterfactually robust way.\n\nConsider a mercury thermometer. Ambient temperature T is not a force that shoves the mercury column upward. Rather, temperature sets the mean kinetic energy of ambient molecules, which in turn determines the mercury\u2019s thermal expansion coefficient, which moves the fluid against gravity. The causal chain involves intermolecular collisions, not some sui generis \u201ctemperature force.\u201d Yet virtually nobody denies that the thermometer measures temperature. The reason is that the mercury height H instantiates a lawful monotonic mapping from T to H. The device exploits that mapping to deliver usable information.\n\nA clock works analogously. The length of a pendulum of constant length l determines its oscillation period \u03c4 = 2\u03c0\u221a(l/g). Gravitational field strength g appears, but time t is not an external variable that must bombard the device; it is internal to the device\u2019s equation of motion. Consequently, successive swings stand in a 1-to-1 correspondence with elapsed seconds. Add a gear train to count swings, and you have a register that stands in the same information relation to t that H stood to T in the thermometer case.\n\nIf the thermometer\u2019s representational legitimacy does not require a \u201ctemperature ray,\u201d neither does the clock\u2019s representational legitimacy require a \u201ctime ray.\u201d\n\n4. Three architectures for temporal representation\n\n4.1 Coupled periodic processes (pendulum clocks, neural oscillators)\n\nMost man-made clocks exploit a physical system that approximates simple harmonic motion: pendula, quartz crystals, cesium atoms. Provided the oscillator\u2019s period is stable across environmental perturbations, its state cycles through a known sequence of phases \u03c6(t). Counting phase transitions yields a discrete metric of elapsed time. Biological systems emulate the same architecture with coupled neural oscillators. Circadian pacemaker cells in the suprachiasmatic nucleus possess transcription-translation feedback loops whose biochemical concentrations wax and wane with \u224824-hour period. External cues such as light entrain, but the core ticking is autonomous. No external \u201ctime force\u201d is needed; the regularity flows from the oscillator\u2019s endogenous dynamics.\n\n4.2 Accumulative processes (hourglasses, integrate-and-fire neurons)\n\nAn hourglass measures time by letting sand accumulate in the lower chamber at near-constant rate r. After t seconds the mass M(t) \u2248 r\u00b7t. Because r is governed by grain size, aperture width, and gravity, the mass serves as an analog register of elapsed time. Many cortical estimates of short intervals plausibly rely on a physiological analog: leaky integration of postsynaptic potentials. Calcium ions accumulate; when concentration crosses threshold, the neuron fires. The firing latency varies with the integrated input, yielding a read-out of elapsed interval.\n\n4.3 Event-timestamping (time cells, phase-of-firing codes)\n\nA more sophisticated strategy stamps external events A, B, C with time tags so that later memory retrieval can reconstruct their order and approximate spacing. In hippocampus, \u201ctime cells\u201d fire at successive moments during a delay period, effectively tiling the interval with overlapping receptive fields. Because the activation pattern unfolds deterministically across the delay, the pattern at retrieval carries information about when an event fell within the window. Again, the dynamical law of the network, not a \u201ctemporal impact,\u201d underwrites the mapping.\n\nEach architecture obeys the same template:\n\nDynamics + Calibration = Temporal Representation.\n\nThe dynamics supply an orderly progression of internal states; calibration (from environmental cues or genetic tuning) aligns particular states with units of physical time. The causal influence that matters is exerted by microscopic forces\u2014gravity, electromagnetic interactions, ionic diffusion\u2014whose evolution is itself temporally parameterized. To say that \u201ctime does nothing\u201d here is to miss that doing \u201cnothing\u201d is precisely what allows every process to do anything at all\u2014their lawful unfolding is time-indexed.\n\n5. Replying to two further objections\n\nObjection 1: Mere correlation is not enough; the system could correlate accidentally with time yet fail to represent it. Why isn\u2019t an aging loaf of bread, whose mold coverage tracks days since baking, a clock?\n\nReply. Representation depends on counterfactual support and functional integration. If you place the loaf in a freezer, mold growth stops; thus the correlation fails under minor interventions. By contrast, a quartz watch under the same freezer intervention continues to tick. Moreover, the watch is embedded in a feedback loop that uses its reading to guide action (e.g., starting the oven at 6:00). The loaf is not in such a loop. Deploying Ruth Millikan\u2019s teleosemantic jargon, the watch has the \u201cproper function\u201d of indicating time; the loaf does not. So the loaf lacks the requisite graded counterfactual robustness and etiological function, while the watch possesses both.\n\nObjection 2: Temporal rate is relative; gravitational time dilation shows that \u201cone second\u201d on a mountain is not equal to \u201cone second\u201d at sea level. Does the possibility of such variance undermine the idea that clocks sense an objective feature?\n\nReply. Any sensory modality functions relative to a reference frame. Atmospheric pressure affects auditory propagation, yet we still hear pitch. Clocks likewise tick in \u201cproper time\u201d along their world-lines. Their readings disagree only if the clocks inhabit different gravitational potentials or inertial trajectories. A single observer needs local temporal information, and local proper time is exactly what a pendulum or quartz crystal tracks. Relativistic corrections become necessary when coordinating distant clocks, just as color constancy mechanisms become necessary when comparing objects under different illuminants. Far from showing that temporal measurement is illusory, relativity shows how subtle the calibration problem can be\u2014precisely the sort of challenge that pushes sensory systems to evolve more sophisticated compensation strategies (e.g., atomic clocks with gravitational corrections built into GPS software).\n\n6. Earning the label \u201csense of time\u201d\n\nMust a sensory modality rely on receptors at a distal body surface? Not obviously. Proprioception is internal (muscle spindles, vestibular canals) yet qualifies as a sense. What matters functionally is informational independence: a dedicated system delivers a proprietary dimension of world-or-self description, whose outputs can be integrated with other modalities for control and prediction.\n\nEmpirical work on interval timing supports the functional independence criterion. Lesions to the cerebellum disrupt millisecond timing without wrecking vision or audition; dopamine agonists dilate perceived intervals; specific cortical oscillations in the beta-gamma band predict temporal discrimination thresholds. A double dissociation between temporal and non-temporal judgments follows, analogous to the dissociation between colour and motion perception. That is as good a mark of a sensory subsystem as one could hope for.\n\nIndeed, the sense of time scores surprisingly high on the classic list of sensory earmarks:\n\n\u2022 Dedicated transducers: molecular clocks, calcium integrators, oscillatory circuits.\n\u2022 Adaptation: perceived duration shortens with repeated presentation (temporal after-effects).\n\u2022 Illusions: \u201ctemporal oddball\u201d effect where a novel stimulus seems longer\u2014the temporal analogue of brightness contrast.\n\u2022 Multimodal binding windows: cross-modal simultaneity judgments rely on temporal acuity thresholds.\n\nSo even if the path from physical property to neuronal code is less \u201cdirect\u201d than the path for light or sound, the system fits comfortably within the broader taxonomic category of sense.\n\n7. Broader philosophical implications\n\nRecognizing time perception as genuine perception loosens the grip of a reflexive \u201ccontact\u201d model of the senses, encouraging a shift toward an ecological view. The organism does not wait passively for the world to pummel its receptors with properties; it actively scaffolds informational links by exploiting law-governed regularities\u2014oscillation, accumulation, decay\u2014that unfold as a matter of course. In this light, the causal theory of perception needs a minor but crucial amendment: what matters is causal coupling plus reliable mapping, not direct physical transfer of the property in question.\n\nThe same revision pays dividends elsewhere. We \u201csee\u201d affordances (the climb-ability of a ledge), \u201chear\u201d emotional valence in prosody, and \u201cfeel\u201d social rejection as pain. None of these involve the direct transduction of an affordance, an emotion, or rejection particle; they involve lawful couplings realized in complex dynamics. Clocks\u2014and by extension, neural timing mechanisms\u2014therefore join a growing list of respectable perceptual systems whose legitimacy rests not on direct bombardment but on skillful exploitation of the world\u2019s structure.\n\n8. Conclusion\n\nThe causal-impotence objection mistakes a contingent feature of some senses (surface mediation by the represented property) for a necessary condition of all sensing. Clocks show how a mechanism can carry information about time without a \u201ctime force\u201d: their internal dynamics instantiate a lawful, counterfactually robust mapping between states of the mechanism and intervals of physical time. Biological and artificial timekeepers implement this mapping via oscillation, accumulation, or sequential activation, often with environmental calibration. Because these mechanisms meet the functional and informational hallmarks of perception, the sense of time is no less genuine than vision or audition\u2014even though its channel of causal contact is the temporally structured evolution of physical processes themselves rather than a dedicated external stimulus. Time does not punch the clock; the clock rides time\u2019s universal wave, and riding is quite enough for sensing.", "output_tokens": 3789, "reasoning_tokens": 896}

The Objection Restated\n\nA standard picture of perception says that for a system S to count as a genuine sensory organ for property P, states of S must be produced by causal influence from P. Photons strike retinal cells, pressure waves deform the cochlea, odor molecules bind to receptors. By contrast, time\u2014usually conceived as a dimension or ordering relation, not a substance\u2014exerts no causal force. If nothing can be pushed, impinged upon, or emitted by \u201ctime itself,\u201d then no biological or mechanical system can literally be a time-sensor. What, then, could a clock (or the circadian pacemaker in the suprachiasmatic nucleus) be doing? At best, says the objection, such devices track something that merely covaries with elapsed time\u2014battery drain, gear rotation, protein phosphorylation\u2014but they do not sense time per se. Hence there is no genuine sense of time.\n\nI shall argue that the objection mis-locates the causal condition on sensory representation. A system need not be bombarded by the very property it represents; it must participate in reliable law-governed causal chains that encode information about that property. Clocks\u2014artificial and biological\u2014satisfy this weaker but sufficient requirement. Time\u2019s \u201ccausal impotence\u201d is therefore no bar to its being the content of a sensory mechanism.\n\n2. Two Misconceptions About Causation and Representation\n\n2.1. Misconception 1: The Stimulus Must Itself Be an Efficient Cause  \nWhat does the thermometer in your lab really detect? It never encounters the abstract property \u201ctemperature\u201d any more than the eye encounters \u201cshape.\u201d Mercury expansion is driven by molecular kinetic energy impacting the glass and fluid. Average kinetic energy (temperature) is an abstraction from those impacts; yet we say the thermometer measures temperature. The moral: what matters is not direct impact by a Platonic property but lawful dependence between the property\u2019s instantiation and the device\u2019s state.\n\nThe same goes for pressure gauges, Geiger counters, and accelerometers. None are pushed by \u201cpressure,\u201d \u201cradiation,\u201d or \u201cinertia\u201d in the substantive sense. They exploit regularities that make features of their internal condition statistically\u2014and, under idealizations, nomically\u2014correlated with magnitudes of interest. Causal contact exists, but it is mediated by concrete processes (molecular collisions, ionizations, inertial mass) that stand in law-like relations to the target property.\n\n2.2. Misconception 2: Endogenous Signals Cannot Count as Sensory  \nA second slip is to demand exogenous energy flow. But proprioception, vestibular balance, and pain illustrate \u201cinternal\u201d senses. The semicircular canals are activated by inertia of endolymph relative to cranial motion; the inertia arises from the subject\u2019s own movement, not an external stimulus. Yet vestibular sensation is uncontroversially sensory. What matters is a specialized receptor regime whose outputs are used downstream for guidance and can misrepresent. Whether the driving energy originated outside or inside the body is irrelevant. The same ethos applies to timing circuits driven by their own metabolic processes.\n\n3. Information Without Push: The Law-Governed Covariance Model\n\nFred Dretske\u2019s information theory offers the right lens. A signal state s carries the information that condition C obtains if, given the nomic background N, the probability of C conditional on s is 1 (or suitably high). Crucially, N mediates the link; no requirement is imposed that C be an efficient cause of s\u2014only that, under N, its obtaining guarantees (or makes highly probable) s.\n\nConsider a pendulum clock. For an ideal simple pendulum of length L in a stable gravitational field g, the period T is 2\u03c0\u221a(L/g). Given N (classical mechanics, negligible air resistance, etc.), the pendulum\u2019s phase \u03c6 at physical time t is a deterministic function f(\u03c6\u2080, t). The gear train couples discrete phase increments to hand positions. When the minute hand is at 12, the clock\u2019s state s carries the information that sixty T-length intervals have elapsed since the last hour-strike, because, under N, that hand position occurs iff that interval has in fact elapsed. The physical causes of each tick are gravitational torque and inertia, not time\u2019s \u201cimpact.\u201d Yet the state lawfully covaries with elapsed time, so it qualifies as a signal of time.\n\nSame story, different physics, for atomic clocks. Cesium-133 atoms transition between hyperfine levels at a rate fixed by quantum electrodynamics. A microwave cavity tuned near the transition frequency resonates only when the phase of the oscillation is in step with the atoms. Count the resonance swings and you count temporal cycles. Time\u2019s passage again adds no energy; still, the count is a law-bound indicator.\n\n4. Biological Timing as Endogenous Clocking\n\nNeurobiology provides converging evidence. The mammalian circadian clock consists of transcription-translation feedback loops among genes Per, Cry, Clock, Bmal. Phosphorylation and dimerization rates create an approximately 24-hour oscillation. Downstream tissues synchronize metabolic and behavioral rhythms to these gene-expression phases. Light input from the retina merely entrains the oscillator to solar time; the fundamental timing is self-sustaining, as demonstrated by organisms kept in constant dark for weeks. Here, too, elapsed time is represented by phase state, not by energy imparted from \u201ctime-particles.\u201d\n\nIf one insists that a proper sensory modality must have receptors triggered by external stimuli, note that temperature entrains circadian oscillators as well. Hot-cold cycles (environmental heat, not time) adjust phase. But the system does not thereupon become a \u201ctemperature sensor.\u201d Representation is multi-modal: one and the same state (Per-Cry complex concentration) simultaneously carries information about (a) time of day and (b) recent thermal cycles. Biological design uses whatever lawful covariations are available.\n\n5. Objection and Reply: Covariance Is Not Enough\n\nCritics raise a familiar worry: mere covariance can be accidental; we need counterfactual robustness. Suppose the pendulum clock is dragged to the Moon. Period lengthens; the hand state no longer tracks seconds. Does the device lose representational content? My reply follows the teleosemantic line: a device represents a magnitude if its proper function (under selection or design) is to guide action by virtue of the causal dependency that normally obtains. On Earth, the pendulum clock was designed to meet that norm; on the Moon it malfunctions. Misrepresentation is thereby possible, satisfying a key hallmark of genuine content. Thus the clock counted time even while on Earth time did not \u201cpush\u201d it; and its miscount off Earth shows the link was non-accidental rather than criterially causal.\n\n6. Why This Suffices for a \u201cSense\u201d of Time\n\nA sensory modality needs:\n\n1. Dedicated transduction hardware.  \n2. Encodings with information-carrying profiles.  \n3. Integration into downstream systems for control, prediction, or representation.  \n4. Possibility of misrepresentation.\n\nClocks\u2014especially neural ones\u2014meet all four. Specialized ion channels (HCN, calcium) form pacemaking membranes; Cycles of phosphorylation act as molecular gears; Output neurons project to sleep\u2013wake and hormonal systems; Jet-lag is their misrepresentation. By the same token, a wristwatch is a prosthetic sensory organ for the human who consults it: they literally perceive the time by visually reading a device whose internal physical evolution reliably encodes elapsed time.\n\n7. A Novel Distinction: Causal Source vs. Causal Condition\n\nThe causal-impotence objection conflates two roles:\n\nSource condition: the property P itself must be the source of causal energy that alters S.  \nConstraint condition: the obtaining of P must be a necessary condition, under background laws, for S occupying a certain state.\n\nFor standard exteroception (vision, audition), the two conditions coincide\u2014photons both supply energy and their presence is required. For time-sense they come apart. Elapsed time is not a source but remains a constraint: under physical law, no pendulum can complete 86,400 periods without 24 sidereal hours having passed. Representation requires only the constraint, not the source. The distinction generalizes: thermostats, fuel gauges, and even logical clocks in distributed computing track abstract quantities (average kinetic energy, remaining fuel, causal order) via constraint conditions.\n\n8. An Analogical Deep Dive: Logical Clocks in Distributed Systems\n\nLamport\u2019s logical clocks timestamp events in a network--critical to ensuring causal ordering without a shared physical time. Each process increments a local counter on events, piggybacks the counter in messages, and merges max values received. The counter value is not driven by time at all; it is driven by message traffic. Yet under causal assumptions (messages travel forward in causal order), the counter encodes \u201chappened-before.\u201d This shows that genuine temporal information can be bootstrapped from relational structure alone. Biological timekeeping does something similar: chemical oscillators, coupled by phase-response curves, synchronize to yield a shared metric suitable for coordination.\n\n9. Addressing Two Residual Concerns\n\n9.1. Time Dilation and Relativity  \nSpecial relativity teaches that rates of processes vary with velocity and gravitational potential. Does this undermine the claim that clocks sense time? No, for representation is always relative to a reference frame built into the normal conditions of use. An airplane\u2019s onboard clock \u201cruns slow\u201d compared to Earth\u2019s surface; still, within its design frame it measures proper time along its world-line. Relativistic physics simply shows there are many temporal magnitudes (coordinate time, proper time). A sensor can be tuned to any one of them.\n\n9.2. Illusion of Flow  \nSome philosophers argue that the felt flow or passage of time is illusory, so no sense could detect it. My argument targets a humbler notion: sensing duration and temporal order, not metaphysical flow. A visual system need not detect \u201cnoumenal extension\u201d to measure distance. Likewise, temporal sensory systems need not resolve the A-series debate to code intervals.\n\n10. Toward a Research Program: Temporal Perception as Structural Inference\n\nTaking the foregoing seriously suggests a broader view: perceptual systems are detectors of invariant structure, not necessarily of substance-like stimuli. Vision recovers 3-D shape by exploiting projective invariances; audition derives pitch from harmonic structure. Time perception recovers duration by exploiting lawful regularities in cyclic or accumulative processes. What unifies sensory modalities, then, is not energy transduction but structural inference under nomic covariance. This framing invites new empirical projects\u2014e.g., designing synthetic bio-oscillators to plug into animal nervous systems and asking whether the animal thereby acquires an additional \u201csense\u201d of ultradian rhythm.\n\n11. Conclusion\n\nThe causal-impotence objection presupposes an outdated transduction model of perception. Once we replace that with an information-theoretic and teleosemantic analysis, the obstacle disappears. A clock\u2014be it a pendulum, an atom, or a gene network\u2014carries information about elapsed time because the evolution of its internal state is lawfully constrained by temporal relations, even though \u201ctime itself\u201d exerts no push. Biological organisms exploit these law-bound correlations to guide behavior, satisfying all the marks of a genuine sensory modality. There is, in this perfectly ordinary sense, a sense of time.", "output_tokens": 3465, "reasoning_tokens": 1024}

The objection turns on a picture of perception in which (i) a sensory organ is activated by the very environmental feature it represents and (ii) representing requires that sort of activation.  I shall argue that both conjuncts are false.  Once we distinguish four ways something can \u201ccarry information,\u201d the sense\u2013data picture of perception loses its grip, and it becomes plain how clocks, brains included, can represent temporal properties without depending on \u201ccausal influence\u201d from time.  I close by suggesting that the resulting account is not merely defensive: it reveals why the human sense of duration has the curious profile it does (mid-range accuracy, systematic contextual distortions, and susceptibility to entrainment).\n\nI.  Clarifying the Target\n\nCall the objection the Causal Impotence Argument (CIA):\n\n1. A system S can represent environmental feature F only if S is causally influenced by F.\n2. Time (or \u201cbare time,\u201d as opposed to events occurring in time) does not causally influence anything.\n\u2234 3. No system can represent time; there is no sense of time.\n\nThe first premise conflates two distinct claims: an etiological claim about how a representational system ever comes to be correlated with F, and a synchronic claim about how it maintains specific correlations on a given occasion.  Both may fail even for paradigmatic senses.  Smell responds to volatile chemicals, but its evolutionary function is to track not \u201cmethyl-mercaptan molecules\u201d as such but food, predators, or mates; the proximal cause and the represented property diverge.  Similarly, binocular vision represents depth by exploiting disparity in retinal images; depth itself does not hit the retina.  The antecedent of (1) therefore needs tightening.\n\nII.  Four Grades of Informational Involvement\n\nTo see how clocks, neural or brass, get informational purchase on time, keep distinct the following:\n\nA. Causal Imprint: the feature F physically impinges on S in a way that depends continuously on F\u2019s magnitude (light on photoreceptors).\n\nB. Law-Governed Covariation: the state of S is nomically locked to the value of F, even if F does not push S; think of a gyroscope indicating inertial orientation.\n\nC. Calibration Link: S has been tuned (by learning or evolution) in an environment where its states statistically correlate with specific ranges of F.\n\nD. Functional Expectation: downstream systems treat S\u2019s states as indicative of F, whether or not the correlation presently holds (this covers hallucination and misperception).\n\nClocks exploit B\u2013D.  The hand position of an escapement clock covaries with the temporal parameter t because Newtonian dynamics guarantee a near-constant period for a pendulum of length L in a given gravitational field.  No one imagines that \u201ctime pushes the pendulum\u201d; rather, the angle of displacement \u03b8(t) is a solution to the differential equation  d\u00b2\u03b8/dt\u00b2 + (g/L)sin \u03b8 = 0.  Once such a law is in place, correlational information is freely available.  The mechanism merely has to be readable.\n\nIII.  The Gyroscope Analogy\n\nOrientation with respect to inertial space (call it \u03a9) is another causally impotent quantity:  facing North does not shove your iPhone\u2019s gyroscope.  Yet micro-electro-mechanical gyroscopes represent \u03a9 by conserving angular momentum in vibrating masses.  Their outputs drive navigation software; we call that \u201csensing orientation.\u201d  If CIA were sound, we would have to deny that smartphones, desert ants, or pigeons represent heading.  The better lesson is that law-governed covariation (II.B) suffices for representation once a consumer system treats the signal as such (II.D).\n\nIV.  Clocks in Flesh and Silicon\n\n1. Circadian clocks.  The SCN (suprachiasmatic nucleus) in mammals contains coupled feedback loops of gene expression with a free-running period of ~24.2 h.  The state of phosphorylation of PER proteins at any moment is not caused by \u201ctime\u201d but by earlier states of the same molecular network plus thermal noise.  Light input does calibrate the oscillator, but after lesion studies we know the loop can run for weeks in isolation culture.  The system embodies a dynamical law; reading any phase variable provides information about elapsed time since the last entraining cue.\n\n2. Interval timing in cortex and basal ganglia.  On the most widely supported models, the brain measures intervals in the hundreds of milliseconds to tens of seconds by detecting the trajectory of population activity in recurrent networks with slowly decaying excitatory or inhibitory currents.  Eigenvalue spectra of such networks give them quasi-linear state-space rotations:  the location of the network\u2019s activity bump after initial stimulation maps onto an elapsed-time estimate.  What drives the change of state?  Endogenous neural dynamics plus baseline noise\u2014not \u201ctime as force.\u201d\n\n3. Atomic clocks.  Cesium-133 atoms absorb microwaves of 9 192 631 770 Hz when transitioned between hyperfine ground states.  If the microwave cavity frequency drifts, feedback adjusts it until absorption peaks.  Again, no mysterious temporal \u201ckick\u201d is required; quantum transitions follow the Schr\u00f6dinger equation with t as a parameter, and that suffices for law-governed covariation.\n\nV.  Answering the Harder Objections\n\nObjection 1:  Covariation without causal influence is too cheap \u2014 everything covaries with everything under a contrived function.  \n\nReply:  Information-carrying covariation must be lawful and exploitable by some consumer mechanism.  The pendulum\u2019s phase is a monotone function of real time over significant ranges, and gear trains translate that phase into an analog of t that can guide action (winding the clock, catching a train, etc.).  Arbitrary correlations lack that double anchor in law and function.\n\nObjection 2:  Law-dependence only relocates the mystery; why should a law with t-parameters count as representing t instead of merely unfolding?  \n\nReply:  Representation is partially pragmatic: a state represents F when the system that uses it treats it as varying with F.  Our SCN projects to almost every major hypothalamic nucleus; feeding, thermoregulation, and hormone release depend on its phase.  Interfering with the clock\u2019s outputs produces behavioral disarray similar to jet lag.  This robust downstream exploitation is absent for, say, the correlation between nail growth and t, so nail length does not function as a timer even though it covaries lawfully with age.\n\nObjection 3:  Even if mechanisms track local duration, they cannot deliver a perceptual \u201csense\u201d of time because perception is by definition exteroceptive.\n\nReply:  Two replies.  (a) Some acknowledged senses (proprioception, nociception, equilibrioception) are introceptive; what matters is not input modality but informational role.  (b) Psychophysically, humans make direct comparative judgments of duration (e.g., interval b is longer than a) with Weber fractions similar to brightness judgments.  The systematic illusions (subjective dilation during oddball or threat stimuli, compression during saccades) parallel biases in standard senses.  The simplest explanatory unification is to class duration-tracking alongside them.\n\nVI.  Why the Human Sense of Time Has Its Character\n\nOur account predicts three empirical features.\n\n1.  Mid-range accuracy.  Because neural oscillators are noisy, Weber fractions for interval timing hover around 10 %.  That is exactly what one expects from integration in a drift-diffusion process with multiplicative noise.\n\n2.  Contextual distortion.  If duration coding piggybacks on population trajectories that are also modulated by attention, arousal, or prediction error, then transient spikes in dopaminergic midbrain activity will distort subjective time.  This matches the observed correlation between dopamine agonists and time-overestimation.\n\n3.  Entrainment.  Because calibration links matter (II.C), periodic exteroceptive cues such as day\u2013night cycles entrain internal clocks.  Missed cues (e.g., cave experiments) reveal the free-running period.\n\nVII.  A Residual Worry:  Time\u2019s Relativity\n\nA final worry:  the mechanisms described assume Newtonian background time, yet in relativity there is no absolute global t.  Does the clock account smuggle in a discredited metaphysics?  No.  Local proper time along a world-line is well-defined in relativity; all the mechanisms we have discussed are parameterized by their own proper times.  Inter-clock comparisons incorporate relativistic shifts (GPS satellites use onboard atomic clocks with relativistic corrections).  Thus our picture of representations that exploit local dynamical laws is in harmony with the best physics available.\n\nVIII.  Conclusions and Consequences\n\n(1)  The Causal Impotence Argument equivocates on \u201ccausal influence.\u201d  Sensory representation need not depend on the represented property\u2019s exerting a force.  \n\n(2)  What matters is the presence of lawful covariation plus functional uptake.  Clocks, both biological and artifactual, achieve this through self-sustaining oscillations or integrating processes whose state variables are predictable monotonic functions of elapsed proper time.\n\n(3)  Accepting this account unifies a host of data on human and animal timing, rescues ordinary talk of a \u201csense of time,\u201d and leaves room for scientifically tractable questions about how those internal clocks are built and calibrated.  \n\n\u201cTime\u201d is indeed causally impotent in the na\u00efve sense\u2014but so is North, temperature in a vacuum, or orientation in inertial space.  Yet we routinely sense or measure all of those by harnessing devices whose internal dynamics stand in the right lawful relations.  A genuine sense of time, like any sense, is an evolved solution to an ecological problem; it exploits the fact that the universe offers stable process laws.  The pendulum, the cesium atom, and the neuronal loop are our allies.  It is in their regular dance\u2014not in any metaphysical shove from Time-with-a-capital-T\u2014that we find the informational bridge.", "output_tokens": 3055, "reasoning_tokens": 832}

Many philosophers and cognitive scientists doubt it.  Their core objection turns on the familiar thought that sensory systems acquire information only when an environmental feature causally impinges on them\u2014photons on the retina, air pressure waves on the cochlea, volatile chemicals on olfactory receptors, and so forth.  But (the objection continues) \u201ctime\u201d is not the sort of entity that can strike, tug, or push.  It is at best a dimension, a parameter, or a form of succession; at worst, it is abstract and wholly causally inert.  Hence nothing in the environment can convey time to a receptor, and so there can be no bona fide time-sense.  Clocks, on this line, merely \u201ctick\u201d in isolation; they do not detect anything.  \n\nI will argue that this objection misfires.  It rests on a conflation between (i) causal origination and (ii) informational registration.  A system can carry perfectly accurate information about a variable without that variable itself exerting any distinctive causal force on the system.  What is required is lawful, counterfactually robust correlation, not direct causal influx from the variable as such.  Once we recognise this, the path is open for explaining how clock-like mechanisms\u2014both artefactual and biological\u2014can serve as genuine time sensors.  The key idea is that they exploit processes whose own dynamics are stably related to elapsed time; by coupling to, counting, or comparing those processes, the mechanism reliably indicates temporal properties.  Time, of course, still does no causal work.  But neither does \u201ctemperature\u201d causally strike a thermometer, nor \u201cvelocity\u201d hit a speedometer, nor \u201cprobability\u201d bombard a Geiger counter.  In each case, information rides in on causal interactions among concrete goings-on that are lawfully linked to the target magnitude, even though the abstract magnitude itself is not a novel causal agent.  \n\nMy thesis, then, is this: the absence of a unique \u201ccausal arrow from time\u201d does not undermine the possibility of time perception or time measurement, because information is secured by lawful covariation, not by the causal potency of the measured variable itself.  Clock mechanisms qualify as time-sensors exactly to the extent that (a) they instantiate internal dynamics whose state variables correlate determinately with temporal parameters, and (b) they are embedded in organisms or artefacts that can exploit those correlations for guidance and control.  A careful look at how artificial clocks, circadian oscillators, and interval timers actually operate dissolves the original worry and suggests a more general lesson: sensing is a functional role, not an ontological relationship to a sui generis kind of causal impact.\n\nI proceed in five steps.  (1) I diagnose the source of the \u201ccausal impotence\u201d worry.  (2) I introduce an information-theoretic conception of sensing that is neutral on the specific causal origin of correlations.  (3) I illustrate the conception with three varieties of clock: periodic oscillators (pendula and quartz crystals), irreversible accumulators (hourglasses and radioactive decay chains), and relational comparators (phase-locked circadian systems).  (4) I address four objections: the redundancy objection, the calibration objection, the perspectival objection, and the epistemic circularity objection.  (5) I close with a brief reflection on the upshot for the philosophy of perception.\n\n1.  The Source of the Worry: Conflating Causal Impact with Measured Magnitude\n\nThe objection rests on a perfectly reasonable picture of canonical sensing.  In paradigmatic exteroception, an environmental magnitude impinges on specialised receptors whose activation directly depends on that magnitude.  Photons with frequency \u03bb cause isomerisation in retinal opsins; acoustic pressure variations cause displacement of hair-cell stereocilia.  In each case the distal property one wants to know about is also a proximal cause.  Generalising from these cases, one might propose the principle:\n\n(Causal Interface Principle) If S senses M, then instances of M exert a characteristic causal influence on S.\n\nTime, on standard views, has no such instances; it is a dimension, not a push or a pressure.  So by the Causal Interface Principle, there can be no sense of time.\n\nYet this principle is questionable.  Consider a mercury thermometer.  What causes the column to rise is not \u201ctemperature\u201d per se, but collisions of faster-moving molecules of air or liquid with the bulb.  Temperature is a statistical property of molecular motion; it is not \u201cin\u201d any one collision.  Nevertheless, the height of the mercury column carries highly reliable information about temperature by virtue of a law-governed correlation.  Similarly, a pitot tube measures airspeed; what pushes on the pressure sensor is air molecules, not \u201cspeed\u201d as such.  Indeed, most interesting physical magnitudes are abstract summaries of underlying micro-events.  The causal relation is always mediated by token interactions that correspond to, but do not literally instantiate, the magnitude being sensed.\n\nOnce this is granted, the Causal Interface Principle must be reformulated:\n\n(Information Principle) S senses M just in case S\u2019s states systematically and lawfully covary with values of M, in a way that can be reasonably exploited for control or representation.\n\nOn this weaker\u2014and I contend more accurate\u2014principle, causal influence is of course required; nothing entirely causally isolated can register anything.  But the influence may come from concrete processes that are nomically tied to M, rather than from M in its abstract guise.  The thermometer is thus a bona fide temperature sensor, even though \u201ctemperature\u201d itself never collides with it.  By parity of reasoning, a clock can be a time sensor if its internal states lawfully track temporal parameters, even though \u201ctime\u201d never strikes it.\n\n2.  Indicator Semantics: Information Without Direct Causation by the Tracked Variable\n\nAn explicit framework helps here.  Fred Dretske\u2019s indicator-semantics and related informational theories of content analyse a state S of system R as expressing proposition p just in case:\n\n(i) There is a lawful correlation: p holds whenever S occurs, within the ambient conditions C.\n(ii) R has the function (derived or natural) of permitting some consumer system to act on p when S obtains.\n\nNotice that p could range over times: p = \u201cthe interval \u03c4 has elapsed since t\u2080\u201d, or \u201cit is now circadian phase \u03c6\u201d.  The lawful correlation might be grounded in the period of a quartz crystal, in the flow rate of sand through a calibrated aperture, or in the phosphorylation cycle of PER proteins in the suprachiasmatic nucleus.  In none of these cases does \u201ctime\u201d causally bombard the sensor.  Rather, physical regularities guarantee that after N oscillations, roughly N\u00d7(period) seconds have passed.  The reliability of the correlation\u2014not a mysterious causal impact from time\u2014underwrites the informational link.\n\nWhy call this \u201csensing\u201d rather than \u201cmere computation\u201d?  Because the mechanism is open to the world in precisely the same sense as vision or audition: its accuracy depends on law-governed interaction with environmental processes.  A quartz wristwatch gains or loses time as ambient temperature changes; an hourglass slows in humid air; a circadian oscillator entrains to the light-dark cycle.  Each is vulnerable to perturbations, and each can be recalibrated by causal engagement with external cues.  These are hallmarks of sensory systems.\n\n3.  Three Families of Time Sensors\n\nConcrete cases make the abstract point vivid.\n\n3.1  Periodic Oscillators\n\nThe archetypal clock is a pendulum.  A mass on a rod swings with period T \u2248 2\u03c0\u221a(L/g).  Nothing about \u201ctime\u201d shoves the bob; gravity and inertia do.  Yet after k periods,  kT seconds have elapsed, give or take small corrections.  The law relating L and T is stable across a wide range of conditions, so a gear train counting swings can indicate elapsed seconds.  Quartz crystals operate on the same principle: piezoelectric feedback sustains oscillation at a resonant frequency determined by the lattice structure.  In effect, the clock exploits a stable dynamical invariant of some material; by counting cycles, it tells time.  \n\nNote the elegance: the system is self-generated\u2014no external time-pulse needed.  Correlation with objective time is secured by the lawful regularity of the intrinsic dynamics, which only persist because of energy flow (battery, gravitational drop), not because \u201ctime\u201d energises the crystal.\n\n3.2  Irreversible Accumulators\n\nHourglasses and clepsydrae employ monotonic processes: sand flowing, water draining, wax burning.  The cumulative volume transferred is (within calibration limits) proportional to elapsed time.  Again, causal interaction is mediated by gravity, viscosity, and aperture shape; time per se need not act.  What matters is that the process has a reliably constant rate.  Even radioactive decay chains can serve: a radiocarbon sample \u201crecords\u201d how long it has been since last equilibrium because the proportion of C-14 atoms remaining statistically declines with half-life \u03c4\u00bd.  Archaeologists read \u201ctime since death\u201d off that ratio, notwithstanding that \u201ctime\u201d never jostled the carbon.\n\n3.3  Relational Comparators\n\nLiving organisms often need to time intervals shorter than a second or longer than a day.  Many species possess circadian oscillators: gene-protein feedback loops whose phase can be reset by light pulses hitting retinal ganglion cells.  The oscillator\u2019s internal state carries information about time of day if it remains phase-locked to the solar cycle.  Mammalian interval timing on the scale of seconds to minutes seems to rely on striatal accumulators or cortical ramping activity calibrated by dopamine signals.  Here the relevant lawlike regularity is more plastic and the calibration constant can drift; but learning mechanisms keep the clock in registry with environmental cues.  Biological clocks thus exemplify the generic sensor model: internal dynamics + external calibration = reliable temporal information.\n\n4.  Four Objections and Replies\n\n4.1  Redundancy: \u201cClocks Merely Infer Time from Change\u201d\n\nOne might object that a pendulum clock does not measure time at all; it merely measures its own oscillations, which we then interpret temporally.  But this threatens to trivialise all measurement.  A thermometer \u201cmerely\u201d measures mercury expansion; a barometer \u201cmerely\u201d measures column height; a photodiode \u201cmerely\u201d measures current flow.  The point of measurement is precisely to exploit a proxy that lawfully covaries with the target magnitude.  Provided the covariance is law-like and appropriately insensitive to confounds, the proxy genuinely measures.  There is no deeper requirement that the magnitude itself be the direct cause.\n\n4.2  Calibration: \u201cWithout an External Standard, the Clock Drifts\u201d\n\nTrue\u2014but again, this parallels ordinary senses.  Vision relies on ocular accommodation and photoreceptor health; both degrade.  Cochlear hair cells wear out.  Yet vision and audition remain senses.  Biological time-keepers combat drift by entraining to Zeitgebers: daylight, temperature cycles, feeding schedules.  Artefactual clocks are synchronised via radio signals or atomic standards.  The need for calibration does not negate sensory status; it shows only that sensing is fallible and, in biological cases, adaptively correctable.\n\n4.3  Perspectival: \u201cTime is Global; Sensors Deliver Local Data\u201d\n\nA sense of time ought to inform one of absolute present, not just elapsed intervals, the critic says.  But all sensory modalities deliver local information: a photoreceptor tells you about light at its location, not the global luminance field.  A local interval timer that informs an organism that \u201c3.2 seconds have passed since the leech bit me\u201d is already behaviourally valuable\u2014e.g., for escape timing or sequence generation.  Absolute dating (today is March 14th) emerges from integrating many interval readings anchored to periodic cues (sunrise, lunar cycles).  The sense of time, so construed, is distributed across a network of specialised mechanisms, each local but collectively global.  \n\n4.4  Epistemic Circularity: \u201cTo Build the Clock, One Already Needed the Concept of Time\u201d\n\nEngineers rely on prior clocks to calibrate new ones; biologists evolve clocks under temporal constraints.  Does this make time sensing circular?  No more than one needs prior eyes to evolve new photoreceptors.  Natural selection rewards organisms whose internal processes resonate with environmental regularities.  The fact that the relevant regularity is temporal does not entail an epistemic vicious circle; selection simply tunes mechanisms so that their dynamics mesh with the day-night rhythm or the speed of prey.  In artificial contexts, reference standards bootstrap the enterprise; but epistemic circularity is avoided because the chain terminates in conventions fixed by the best current standard, not in impossible self-validation.\n\n5.  Implications for the Philosophy of Perception\n\nThe debate illuminates a larger moral: the taxonomy of the senses should be functionally rather than ontologically grounded.  What unifies vision, audition, and proprioception is not a distinctive kind of causal impact from \u201clightness\u201d, \u201cloudness\u201d, or \u201cposition\u201d, but a functional profile: receptor transduction, neural coding, calibration, and behavioural exploitation.  Time-keeping mechanisms share that profile.  They (a) transduce token events (oscillatory cycles, molecular decays) into neural or mechanical states, (b) encode those states in ways that preserve temporal metric information, (c) calibrate via feedback, and (d) guide action\u2014sleep-wake schedules, speech rhythm, musical performance, predator avoidance.  Hence either we recognise a genuine sense of time, or we must drastically shrink our notion of sensing to exclude many uncontroversial cases.  \n\nThe deeper lesson is semantic.  Information is cheap: lawful covariation suffices.  Causal impact is necessary, of course, but the source of impact may be a proxy, not the measured magnitude itself.  Once this is acknowledged, the supposed causal impotence of time ceases to threaten time perception.  Clocks, biological or artefactual, are time sensors because the states they occupy are reliable indicators, within a stable nomic background, of objective temporal properties.  Time does not have to knock; the door is opened by regularity.", "output_tokens": 3549, "reasoning_tokens": 512}

The objection rests on a mistaken assumption about what it takes for a physical system to carry information.  A sensory or measuring device does not need to be acted upon by the very property it represents; it is enough that the device\u2019s states stand in a reliable, law\u2010grounded correlation with that property.  Because many physical processes unfold at a dynamical rate that is lawfully invariant, a biological or artefactual \u201cclock\u201d can exploit such processes to map its own causal evolution onto temporal intervals.  Hence a mechanism can represent time without time itself exerting any causal force.  The sense of time is possible in the same way an odometer senses distance: by harnessing a process whose cumulative changes covary with the target magnitude, not by being pushed on by \u201cdistance\u201d or \u201ctime.\u201d\n\nPlan.  (1) Disentangle causal influence, covariation, and representation. (2) Rebut the causal\u2010impotence argument by analogy with other measurement cases. (3) Show how clocks turn self\u2010moving dynamics into temporal information. (4) Address three objections: calibration, drift, and the \u201cno external stimulus\u201d worry. (5) Extend the reply to biological time perception. (6) Close with a moral about what sensory systems really are.\n\n1. Causal influence vs. informational relevance  \n\nThe objection presupposes a simple picture:\n\nP1. A sensory system S represents environmental magnitude M only if M causally affects S.  \nP2. Time (as such) does not causally affect anything.  \nC. Therefore there is no genuine sensing of time.\n\nPremise P1 is too strong.  Consider four diagnostic counterexamples.\n\na.  The odometer.  The device tracks kilometres travelled.  What causally turns the gear train is rotation of the axle, not \u201cdistance.\u201d  Nevertheless, its counter reliably covaries with distance because, given the constraint that tyre circumference = c, N rotations = N\u00b7c metres.  \n\nb.  The fuel gauge.  In many float systems the gauge reads \u201c40 L\u201d when the float\u2019s height is h.  What pushes the float is petrol, not \u201cvolume\u201d in the abstract; but the pointer is informative about volume because of known hydrostatic regularities.  \n\nc.  MRI thermometry.  Magnetic resonance phase shift in water molecules is sensitive to temperature.  Temperature does not push protons; magnetic fields do.  Yet phase encodes temperature via a lawful mapping F(phase) \u2192 T.  \n\nd.  Natural signs.  Tree rings encode past rainfall; rings are produced by cambial growth and nutrients, not by \u201cthe amount of rain\u201d acting directly.  Still, dendroclimatologists legitimately treat ring width as evidence for rainfall because of statistical regularities.\n\nMoral: What matters is not that M directly strikes S, but that there is (i) a stable causal chain from some proximal causal goings\u2010on to S, and (ii) a law or statistical regularity linking those proximal goings\u2010on to M.  If those two conditions hold, S\u2019s state carries Shannon information about M and\u2014under standard teleosemantic or indicator\u2010semantic accounts\u2014represents M.\n\n2. Why time is no special spoil\u2010sport  \n\nSuppose a quartz crystal oscillates at 32 768 Hz when driven by a fixed voltage.  The driving voltage, by piezoelectric coupling, causes the crystal to deform; the mechanical resonance then produces an electrical square wave.  Time does not push the crystal.  Yet there is a mathematically tight relation:\n\nIf the crystal has completed N oscillations, then elapsed time \u2248 N / 32 768 seconds.\n\nIn information\u2010theoretic terms, mutual information I(N; t) is maximised (subject to noise) because the deterministic law induces a one\u2010to\u2010one mapping between count of cycles and elapsed time.  A microcontroller that counts cycles can, by a simple division, output the current time of day.  It therefore represents time.  Nothing spooky occurs; we simply exploit a lawful regularity between a causal process internal to the device and the abstract parameter t that indexes solutions to the differential equation d\u00b2x/dt\u00b2 + (\u03c9\u00b2)x = 0.\n\nHence P1 in the objection should be replaced by a more nuanced principle:\n\nP1*.  A system S can represent magnitude M if some subset of S\u2019s physically produced states covaries with M under a law L that is usable by the consumer of those states.\n\nOnce the quartz mechanism is installed in a watch, the user (or the rest of the circuitry) is the consumer; she knows, implicitly or explicitly, that every 32 768 ticks \u2248 1 s.  Time\u2019s alleged causal impotence is irrelevant; the representation piggybacks on the lawful synchrony between the crystal\u2019s dynamics and temporal metric structure.\n\n3. From self\u2010moving dynamics to temporal information  \n\nGeneral recipe for a clock:\n\nStep 1.  Start with a self\u2010sustaining, periodic or monotonically accumulating process P: pendulum swings, radioactive decay chains, caesium hyperfine transitions, or neuronal \u201cramp\u201d activity caused by calcium influx.\n\nStep 2.  Show that P\u2019s internal state variable x(t) satisfies a differential equation whose solution is either periodic with constant period T or monotone with known rate r (e.g., dx/dt = r).\n\nStep 3.  Design a read\u2010out R that maps some readily detectable feature of P (zero\u2010crossings, pulse counts, threshold passage) onto a tally variable k.\n\nStep 4.  Construct a code C such that decoding(k) = f\u207b\u00b9(k) returns elapsed time \u0394t with error \u03b5 < \u03b4.\n\nEach step is purely causal\u2014oscillation, detection, counting, computation\u2014but the device as a whole earns the right to say \u201cthree minutes have passed\u201d because f is mathematically guaranteed.  Time need not cause anything beyond the causal march of the dynamical law itself.\n\nConsider a sandglass.  What drives the flow is gravity acting on sand grains.  The designer empirically verifies that volume v crosses the neck per second.  Turning the glass at noon thereby establishes a relation:\n\nIf height h of the upper column = 0, then t \u2248 noon + (V_total/v) s.\n\nAgain, gravity, viscosity, and grain geometry do the causal work; time figures only as the parameter in v = dh/dt.  Yet the position of the meniscus legitimately indicates time.\n\n4. Replies to three lingering worries  \n\nWorry 1.  Calibration.  How does the clock acquire the law L linking its internal dynamics to real time?  Short answer: by external calibration\u2014matching noon on the sundial to 12:00 on the quartz watch\u2014or by evolutionary learning in organisms.  The dependence on calibration does not undermine representation; it is a familiar fact about measurement generally (thermometers are calibrated in ice baths).\n\nWorry 2.  Drift.  Every physical oscillator drifts owing to temperature, ageing, or noise.  But representational success does not require infallibility, only sufficient reliability for the organism\u2019s or engineer\u2019s purposes.  Error correction\u2014daily radio\u2010time pips, circadian entrainment by light\u2014keeps drift within acceptable bounds.\n\nWorry 3.  No external stimulus.  Vision, hearing, touch all involve an ongoing causal input.  Clocks seem \u201cdark,\u201d producing signals spontaneously.  Does that make them bona fide senses?  Here one must distinguish two projects: (i) the metaphysical possibility of time representation (our topic), and (ii) whether time sense should count as a proper modality.  The first is secured by the argument above.  For the second, consider proprioception: muscle spindles give information about limb position largely from endogenous signals; yet proprioception is a recognised sense.  What matters is informative value, not the exogenous/endogenous divide.\n\n5. Biological time perception  \n\nHuman and animal brains instantiate many clocklike subsystems:\n\na.  Circadian oscillators.  The phosphorylation cycle of PER/CRY proteins in suprachiasmatic neurons has a near\u201024h period.  Light serves as a zeitgeber to phase\u2010lock the oscillator, but once entrained the molecular loop free\u2010runs.  The loop\u2019s phosphorylation state \u03c6(t) is used to modulate body temperature, hormone release, and subjective alertness; downstream circuits decode \u03c6(t) as \u201ctime of day.\u201d  \n\nb.  Interval timing in basal ganglia and cerebellum.  Dopaminergic ramping sets a drift rate r for striatal neurons; after a \u201cgo\u201d cue, accumulated activity A(t) \u2248 r\u00b7t.  When A crosses threshold \u03b8, the animal anticipates reward.  Manipulating dopamine alters perceived duration, showing that the internal rate constant, not an external clock pulse, drives timing.\n\nc.  Reentrant cortical loops.  Some models treat recurrent neural activity as a high\u2010dimensional trajectory; elapsed time is decoded from the current point on the trajectory via population codes.  Again, the causal movers are synaptic currents, not an abstract \u201ctime force.\u201d\n\nIf one accepts that neuronal firing patterns represent sound frequency or spatial location by lawful correlation, consistency dictates that they can represent duration by the same criterion.\n\n6. What sensory systems really are  \n\nThe deeper lesson is methodological.  Philosophers often construe sensing as a two\u2010place causal relation: environmental magnitude \u2192 receptor.  But information theory and cognitive science favour a three\u2010place relation:\n\nMagnitude M is represented by system S for consumer C when  \n(i) states of S are causally produced in ways statistically dependent on M, and  \n(ii) C is suitably disposed to use those states as a guide to facts about M.\n\nCausal dependence need not be direct or force\u2010mediated by M itself; it may be mediated by any reliable bridge law.  Time, being a parameter in every dynamical law, always furnishes such a bridge: if process P obeys dP/dt = F(P), then P\u2019s evolution is law\u2010entangled with t.  A designer or an evolved organism can therefore turn P into a clock by attaching a consumer attuned to that entanglement.\n\nConclusion.  The \u201ctime is causally impotent\u201d objection conflates causal interaction with informational correlation.  Once we separate the two, we see that a clock mechanism is simply a physical process whose lawful evolution is used by some consumer\u2014human, electronic, or neural\u2014to infer temporal facts.  Time need not push on the mechanism; its role is already built into the dynamical law that governs the mechanism\u2019s own causal unfolding.  Accordingly, there is nothing incoherent in positing a genuine sense of time, and plenty of empirical evidence\u2014quartz watches, circadian oscillators, ramping neurons\u2014to show how it is realised.", "output_tokens": 2862, "reasoning_tokens": 576}

Photons bombard the retina, pressure waves buffet the cochlea, airborne chemicals bind olfactory receptors; in each case an external, causally efficacious feature of the world does work on a specialized peripheral transducer. By contrast, the objection continues, \u201ctime itself\u201d never bombards, buffets, or binds. If sense organs are defined by reception of causal influence from the feature sensed, then there can be no genuine \u201csense of time,\u201d nor could a clock\u2014biological or mechanical\u2014count as a sensor for a feature that exerts no force.  \n\nI will argue that this objection rests on a conflation between (a) a metaphysically spare conception of time as a universal parameter and (b) concrete temporal regularities instantiated in physical processes. Once we distinguish the two, we see that clocks do gather time-relevant information by being causally coupled to temporally regular processes, even though no sui generis \u201cforce of time\u201d impinges on them. In short:\n\nThesis: A device can encode accurate temporal information not because \u201ctime causes it to change,\u201d but because it is itself a causally situated physical process whose state reliably covaries\u2014by lawful necessity\u2014with elapsed duration. Temporal sensing is therefore an instance of relational information gathering rather than transduction of a proprietary causal signal.  \n\nThe argument proceeds in four stages. First, I disentangle three senses of \u201ctime\u201d and show that only one is relevant to perception. Second, I supply an information-theoretic model that renders causal influence unnecessary for carrying information. Third, I analyze how ordinary clocks\u2014mechanical, atomic, or neural\u2014embody this model. Finally, I answer two lingering objections: the \u201carbitrariness\u201d challenge (why does a given process track time rather than something else?) and the \u201crate drift\u201d challenge (does calibration presuppose an external standard and thereby beg the question?). Along the way I draw on examples from biology and technology that, I contend, reframe the entire debate over temporal sensing.\n\n1. Three faces of time  \n------------------------------------------------  \nPhilosophical discussions often slide between three progressively more austere conceptions:\n\n1.1 Metric time.  This is time as a quantitative dimension\u2014seconds, hours, and days\u2014needed to state the laws of dynamics. It is the \u201ct\u201d in Newton\u2019s mechanics and in Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s equation.  \n\n1.2 Event time.  Here \u201ctime\u201d denotes concrete temporal relations among events: duration, simultaneity, and temporal order. These are not abstract axes but relational properties instantiated by sequences of states.  \n\n1.3 Causal time-force (the straw target).  A folkloric notion according to which time is an invisible \u201csomething\u201d that pushes the world along. If \u201ctime flows,\u201d perhaps it exerts a kind of pressure.\n\nThe objection presupposes 1.3: if time exerts no pressure on a sensor, nothing temporal can be sensed. But once we jettison 1.3, the problem evaporates. Sensory systems need not couple to the *dimension* of time; they need only be embedded within temporally structured processes whose evolution is law-bound. A pendulum\u2019s swing, an oscillating cesium atom, or the decay of radioactive nuclei are examples. Nothing pushes them *because* a minute has passed; rather, the passage of a minute *just is* their undergoing sixty periods of a certain lawful change.  \n\nImportantly, our other senses also pivot on embedding rather than direct impact. Consider proprioception. Muscle spindle afferents are deformed by changes in muscle length, but the property perceived\u2014limb position\u2014is relational (angles among joints). The joint angle does not itself impinge on receptors; mechanical stretch does. Likewise, temporal perception can piggy-back on causal factors\u2014oscillatory neural firings, metabolic cycles\u2014whose lawful unfolding *instantiates* durations.\n\n2. Information without a dedicated temporal force  \n------------------------------------------------  \nClaude Shannon\u2019s central lesson was that information is, at root, correlation. Variable X carries information about variable Y to the extent that the state of X reduces uncertainty about Y. Causal influence is one, but only one, route to correlation. For example, the rings of a tree carry reliable information about age, yet age does not flow into the trunk as an external cause; it is *reflected* in the physical accretion process. Similarly, glacier ice layers record past snowfall without past times acting on the ice.\n\nTranslate this into the sensory case: Let S(t) be the internal state of a clock or neural circuit, and let \u0394 be elapsed duration. Because both S and \u0394 are governed by the same dynamical law (often expressible as dS/dt = k), mutual information I(S;\u0394) can be high even though \u0394 never causally \u201cstrikes\u201d S. What matters is lawful co-evolution, not a one-way arrow of force.\n\nPhilosophers of information sometimes require \u201cindicator causation\u201d: the correlating relation must itself be causal to ground content. Our model satisfies that: the *process* that evolves S is causal through and through, even if the *variable* \u0394 is not an extra substance in the causal nexus. Put differently, clocks measure time by *being causes*, not by *being caused* by time.\n\n3. Anatomy of a clock: oscillators as temporal sensors  \n------------------------------------------------  \nLet us now anatomize three paradigms.\n\n3.1 The pendulum clock  \nA pendulum of length L has period T = 2\u03c0\u221a(L/g). Gravity g and the mechanical constraint of the rod dictate the differential equation d\u00b2\u03b8/dt\u00b2 = -(g/L)sin\u03b8. There is no term \u201cF_time.\u201d A gear train counts swings; the displayed state after n oscillations covaries with elapsed duration nT. The causal story runs solely through forces of tension, gravity, and inertia. Yet anyone reading the dial acquires accurate temporal information.\n\n3.2 The atomic clock  \nCesium-133 atoms have a hyperfine transition frequency of 9,192,631,770 Hz. In the presence of a resonant microwave cavity, the atoms absorb and emit radiation, locking an electronic oscillator to that frequency. Again, no time-force agitates the atoms; quantum electrodynamics plus the weak interaction suffice. Because the transition is a universal constant, the resulting correlation between oscillator phase and duration is breathtakingly stable\u2014hence our current definition of the second.\n\n3.3 Circadian and interval timing in biology  \nMammalian suprachiasmatic nuclei house transcription-translation feedback loops that generate roughly 24-hour rhythms. Though light cues entrain the phase, the intracellular chemical kinetics would tick away even in constant darkness. More striking are sub-second interval timers observed in cerebellar Purkinje cells: cascades of calcium-induced calcium release create stereotyped temporal windows that guide motor learning. No \u201chormone of time\u201d drips onto these cells; rather, molecular reaction chains close only after set delays, giving neural populations an internal stopwatch.\n\nAcross these cases, time is \u201csensed\u201d as a *ratio* of states: number of swings, phase angle, phosphorylation level. A sensor, broadly speaking, is any subsystem whose state space partitions trackable environmental magnitudes in an evolutionarily useful way. That criterion is met.\n\n4. Answering two hard objections  \n------------------------------------------------  \n4.1 The arbitrariness challenge  \nWhy think a pendulum tracks time rather than \u201cnumber of oscillations\u201d? Similarly, why not treat a neuron\u2019s calcium concentration as a marker for calcium, full stop? The worry is semantic: what authorizes the temporal interpretation over others?\n\nAnswer: What grounds content in such systems is functional embedding. The pendulum\u2019s oscillations drive gear trains whose only role is to coordinate actions\u2014opening the clock face, timing factory shifts\u2014where accuracy is evaluated against temporal criteria (celestial cycles, social schedules). In biological settings, natural selection favors organisms that successfully use these internal states to anticipate periodic opportunities (e.g., flower opening). Misinterpret the state as anything other than duration and fitness plummets. Hence Ruth Millikan\u2019s \u201cbio-semantic\u201d teleology: the proper function of the state is to indicate duration.\n\nNotice that the same teleological underpinning is needed for canonical senses. If one treated retinal outputs as indicators of photon energy but used them to guide audition, visual content attribution would collapse. Temporal sense therefore enjoys parity of explanatory footing with vision and touch.\n\n4.2 The rate-drift challenge  \nClock mechanisms can speed up or slow down (temperature affects pendulum length; metabolic rates vary). Doesn\u2019t calibration presuppose an independent time standard, smuggling in what the objection disallows?\n\nThree replies.\n\nFirst, drift is ubiquitous in sensing. Cones bleach, olfactory receptors saturate. Calibration\u2014via saccades, sniffing, or homeostatic gain control\u2014does not negate the genuineness of vision or smell. It is a design feature of robust sensing.\n\nSecond, many biological timers self-correct through multi-oscillator coupling; the SCN averages signals across thousands of neurons, and errors cancel. Engineering analogues include quartz oscillators whose temperature coefficients are deliberately inverted.\n\nThird and crucially, calibration does not presuppose a prior temporal sensor; it piggy-backs on *external periodic events*: day\u2013night transitions, heartbeats in fetal development, even planetary tides. Those events are themselves physical processes, not metaphysical clocks. Hence the supposed vicious regress never starts.\n\n5. From transduction to embodiment: reframing the debate  \n------------------------------------------------  \nLet us step back. The objection\u2019s grip stems from an outmoded, input-output model of sense organs. On this view a peripheral receptor must be bombarded by a stimulus field, transduce it, and send the result inward for processing. But contemporary cognitive science emphasizes *embodied prediction*. Organisms maintain dynamically updated generative models; perception is the matching of internal dynamics to external regularities. In such a framework, a sensory system is any suite of mechanisms whose evolving state is predictively coupled to structured aspects of the environment. Temporal regularities are precisely such structure. Thus an endogenous oscillator, continually entrained by sunrise, qualifies as sensory in the broader sense of \u201cinformation-gathering interface.\u201d\n\nThe philosophical upshot is a shift from *impact* to *co-variance*: perceiving time is not detecting a stuff but skillfully riding the lawful symphony of change that is the world. The retina does something analogous: it outputs spatio-temporal contrasts rather than raw luminance, betting on correlations with object boundaries. Temporal perception similarly bets on correlations among internal phases, motor efference copies, and external rhythms.\n\n6. Two revealing comparisons  \n------------------------------------------------  \n6.1 Magnetic direction  \nA magnetotactic bacterium or a migratory bird \u201csenses north.\u201d But north is not a causal agent; the magnetic *field* is. Still, \u201cnorth\u201d is just a relational property of that field\u2014its orientation relative to Earth\u2019s axis. Nobody doubts that magnetic detection is a genuine sense even though \u201cnorthness\u201d per se exerts no additional force beyond the field. Time stands to clocks as north stands to magnetite crystals: an abstraction read off lawful structure.\n\n6.2 Temperature perception  \nThermo-receptors transduce molecular kinetic energy, but what they report is macro-level temperature. Temperature, like time, is not a fundamental force but a statistical measure of microstates. The transducer does not interact with temperature tout court; it interacts with vibrating molecules. Yet we readily grant a sense of temperature. Why treat time differently?\n\n7. Consequences for philosophy of mind  \n------------------------------------------------  \nGranting a sense of time illuminates puzzling phenomena:\n\n\u2022 Experienced duration dilation under emotional arousal can be reinterpreted as gain modulation in neural pacemakers.  \n\u2022 The apparent continuity of conscious experience (the specious present) may reflect high-order inferences from overlapping oscillatory hierarchies.  \n\u2022 Temporal illusions (e.g., \u201ccolour\u2013phi\u201d) become analogues of visual illusions: evidence of constructive inference rather than proof that time is not sensed.\n\nRecognizing clocks as sensors also blurs the boundary between perception and memory. Interval timing over seconds to minutes relies on ramping synaptic traces, which double as short-term storage. Thus the traditional tripartition\u2014sense, cognition, memory\u2014looks less like a taxonomy of faculties and more like a spectrum of temporally discriminating mechanisms.\n\n8. Conclusion  \n------------------------------------------------  \nThe initial objection stumbles by mislocating the requisite causal link. Sensory systems need not be struck by the very property they represent; they need only participate in causal processes whose lawful unfolding carries information about that property. Because physical laws specify how systems change *with respect to time*, any system with sufficiently reliable intrinsic dynamics can become a timekeeper. Pendulums, cesium atoms, phosphorylating proteins, and reverberating neural networks are all eligible. Time\u2019s alleged causal impotence is beside the point: sensing duration is not a matter of being pushed by time but of skilfully exploiting the world\u2019s rhythmic constancies.\n\nOnce we abandon the myth of a \u201ctime force,\u201d the case for a genuine sense of time looks no weaker, and in some respects stronger, than the case for proprioception, magnetoception, or thermoreception. Clock mechanisms, biological and artefactual alike, therefore exemplify how an organism or instrument can carry information about time through lawful co-evolution rather than transduction of a dedicated causal signal. Far from being an embarrassment, temporal sensing reminds us that information lies in structure and relation, not in mysterious fluids flowing from properties into minds.", "output_tokens": 3227, "reasoning_tokens": 384}

Introduction and Thesis  \n\nThe \u201ccausal\u2010impotence\u201d objection to a sense of time runs as follows. (1) Sensory systems provide information only if some environmental feature causally impinges on the receptor surface: light on retina, chemicals on olfactory epithelium, pressure on skin. (2) Time, unlike light or pressure, has no causal powers; it is \u201cthat in which\u201d events occur, not a force that pushes on things. (3) Therefore no mechanism\u2014neural or mechanical\u2014can literally sense time. At most, organisms make post-hoc inferences from sequences of other sensations.  \n\nI argue that the objection rests on a mistaken picture of how information can be carried and how measurement works. A mechanism can inform an agent about a magnitude not by being struck by that very magnitude, but by exploiting law-like regularities that set up reliable correlations between its internal state transitions and the temporal relations in its environment.  Clocks\u2014both biological and artifact\u2014are paradigms of this indirect, \u201cstructure-exploiting\u201d mode of sensing. Time need not shove the hands of a clock; the lawful dynamics of the clock\u2019s components suffice to embed temporal information in its states. \n\nI develop the response in five steps:\n\n1. Distinguish two routes by which a system can carry information: impact-driven and dynamic-law-driven.  \n2. Show, using an information-theoretic criterion, that the dynamic-law route is sufficient for bona fide sensory representation.  \n3. Analyse mechanical clocks as concrete examples; demonstrate how they satisfy the criterion without time\u2019s causal help.  \n4. Extend the lesson to biological timing mechanisms\u2014circadian oscillators and interval timers in vertebrate brains\u2014showing that organisms plausibly possess a genuine sense of time.  \n5. Address residual worries: Does the view trivialise the notion of sensing? Aren\u2019t clocks merely measuring devices, not senses? What about temporal illusions?  \n\nMy conclusion: the causal-impotence objection fails. Sensory systems need only be causally sensitive to *states of affairs that lawfully covary with* the target magnitude; direct causal influence from the magnitude itself is optional. Appreciating this reshapes the debate about temporal perception and, more generally, about the taxonomy of senses.\n\nII. Two Ways of Carrying Information  \n\nConsider Dretske\u2019s (1981) useful definition: a signal S carries information about a variable X if, given suitable background conditions, P(X | S)/P(X) = 1. That is, learning S removes uncertainty about X. On the face of it, retinal activations satisfy the condition because photons (\u201cX = there is light of wavelength \u03bb from direction \u03b8\u201d) impinge directly on photoreceptors, altering their state. Call this impact-driven information.  \n\nBut Dretske\u2019s formula is silent on whether *X itself* causes S, or whether some third factor does. What matters is reliable covariance. Suppose a sealed digital thermometer is in thermal equilibrium with its surroundings. The outside air\u2019s temperature and the display reading are nomically linked: given the device\u2019s calibration history, the reading perfectly covaries with the ambient temperature. Yet the number \u201c23 \u00b0C\u201d on the display is not caused by temperature *as such* but by the expansion of a liquid, the resistance of a thermistor, or some other intermediate property. Still, it carries information about temperature. The causal chain runs from air molecules to internal changes to the display; \u201ctemperature\u201d names a relational property of the molecular distribution, not a force. \n\nDynamic-law information extends this idea. Some mechanisms have intrinsic dynamics\u2014oscillations, decay rates, phase lags\u2014that are lawfully related to elapsed time. If the period of an oscillator is stable, then counting cycles yields information about duration even though \u201ctime\u201d never strikes the system. An hourglass, for example, provides a state (amount of sand in the lower bulb) whose magnitude covaries with elapsed time via gravity and flux rate. No one thinks gravity \u201cmeasures sand\u201d or \u201ctime pushes sand grains\u201d; yet learning how much sand has fallen lets an observer infer time.  \n\nThus, covariance can be mediated by (i) causal chains initiated by the target property or (ii) stable internal dynamics correlated with the target. Both are legitimate under Dretske\u2019s information criterion.\n\nIII. How Clocks Work Without Time Causation  \n\nA paradigmatic mechanical clock contains three parts: (a) a resonator (pendulum, balance wheel, quartz crystal) with a period T determined by physical parameters; (b) an escapement that converts oscillations into discrete steps; (c) a counter/display.  The resonator\u2019s successive states S1, S2, \u2026 Sn occur at intervals \u2248 T. The law of simple pendular motion guarantees that, within engineering tolerances, the number n of swings after start moment t0 covaries linearly with elapsed time \u0394t = nT.  \n\nCritically, time plays no causal role beyond being the dimension in which the causal story unfolds. Gravity and inertia generate the oscillations; friction damps them; the escapement injects periodic energy. The device\u2019s *internal structure* plus background physical laws sets up the covariance. The final display \u201c10:37\u201d carries information because, conditional on correct calibration and normal operation, the mutual information I(Display; Real-time) is high.  \n\nFrom an interventionist viewpoint (Woodward 2003), the relation is counterfactually robust. If one were to intervene on the length of the pendulum arm, one would systematically change the rate; intervening on real time while holding physics fixed is metaphysically impossible\u2014hence the appearance that time lacks causal powers. But that impossibility doesn\u2019t undermine the counterfactual: had the arm been longer, the same number of swings would correlate with a greater elapsed time. The device\u2019s functional profile embeds the time variable.  \n\nOne might object that the device works only because an external agent designed and calibrated it. But design is not essential: the same principle applies to naturally occurring processes. Consider radioactive decay: the fraction of undecayed nuclei at moment t is e^{\u2013\u03bbt}. Physicists exploit this by measuring remaining activity to infer sample age\u2014again, no causal influence emanates from \u201ctime.\u201d Covariance suffices.\n\nIV. Biological Timing: Toward a Sense of Time  \n\nOrganisms exploit dynamical regularities in roughly three regimes: circadian (~24 h), interval (milliseconds\u2013seconds), and millisecond-level sequencing (speech, locomotion). I claim that at least some of these mechanisms deserve to be classified as sensory. Let me focus on vertebrate interval timing, studied in the basal ganglia\u2013cerebellar circuits.\n\n(a) Empirical sketch. Neurons in the striatum exhibit ramping firing profiles whose slopes scale with the to-be-timed interval; dopaminergic modulation adjusts pacemaker rates; lesions disrupt duration-based decisions. Animals can perform temporal bisection, generalisation, and Weber-law scalar timing\u2014all hallmarks of psychophysical sensing.  \n\n(b) Information analysis. Suppose an internal pacemaker emits ticks at mean rate r. An accumulator counts ticks until criterion k is reached, then triggers a behavioural response (e.g., press lever). Under stationary conditions, the expected number of ticks correlates with elapsed time: E[\u0394t] = k/r. Inflating r via pharmacological manipulation predictably compresses subjective time. The neural state\u2014number of ticks\u2014thus carries Shannon information about \u0394t.  \n\n(c) Independence from non-temporal cues. Experiments randomise retinal flow, proprioception, and auditory events; animals still time accurately, indicating that duration estimation is not inferred from exteroceptive change but from endogenous dynamics.  \n\nThe system therefore parallels the mechanical clock: no causal arrow runs from \u201ctime\u201d to neurons; rather, the lawful decay of dopaminergic modulation and oscillatory circuits sets up a correlation exploited for behaviour. If we are willing to call proprioception a sense though it relies on efference-copy and muscle spindle dynamics, parity demands recognising an internal sense of duration.\n\nV. Objections and Replies  \n\n1. \u201cCorrelation isn\u2019t causation; without causal impact you don\u2019t have sensing, only computation.\u201d  \nReply: Vision, audition, etc. crucially depend on correlations too. Photons do not carry \u201credness\u201d; the nervous system must exploit systematic covariation between wavelengths and photoreceptor responses shaped by evolutionary calibration. The only extra condition for sensing is that the correlation be *registered by the organism for guiding action*. Temporal mechanisms satisfy this.\n\n2. \u201cClocks are not senses; they\u2019re tools. Biological timers are internal controls, not perceptual.\u201d  \nReply: The distinction between interoceptive sensing and control is porous. Baroreceptors sense blood pressure to regulate homeostasis; yet few deny they are sensory neurons. If a system produces contentful estimations usable across behavioural domains (e.g., predicting duration, synchronising movement, acquiring language prosody), that is better classified as a sense than a mere reflex. Time-keeping networks meet this functional/general-purpose criterion.\n\n3. \u201cYour view trivialises sensing: any lawful change becomes \u2018time information\u2019.\u201d  \nReply: Not any change, only changes whose parametrisation tracks temporal metrics across contexts and is treated by the organism as such. The length of my fingernails covaries with age, but the body doesn\u2019t consult nail length to decide birthday cake size. Contrast interval neurons: downstream circuits read their output to decide when to start courtship songs. The informational/functional role screens off accidental correlations.\n\n4. Temporal illusions (e.g., intentional binding, chronostasis) show that time perception is highly malleable; this counts against a dedicated sense.  \nReply: All modalities suffer illusions when underlying cues are perturbed (e.g., colour constancy failures). The very possibility of systematic distortion implies a process specialised enough to go wrong in specifiable ways. Indeed, illusions help map the computations\u2014the recalibration at saccades in chronostasis reveals that time-estimating circuits integrate efference copy with pacemaker counts.\n\nVI. Clarifying the Conceptual Lesson  \n\nThe causal-impotence objection mistakes a metaphysical point for a functional constraint. Yes, time is not a \u201ccause\u201d alongside electromagnetic or mechanical forces. But a sensory system does not need the target magnitude to be a force; it needs a *law-grounded mapping* from the magnitude to internal states the organism can use. That mapping may be mediated by dynamics intrinsic to the organism. Clocks, hourglasses, radiocarbon decay, circadian oscillators, and basal-ganglia accumulators all instantiate such mappings.  \n\nA helpful distinction emerges:\n\nDirect-impact measurement  \n    stimulus: proximal energy specific to magnitude  \n    example: photons for vision, pressure waves for hearing\n\nEndogenous-dynamics measurement  \n    stimulus: none; the system\u2019s own evolution correlates with magnitude  \n    example: pendulum swings for time, radioactive decay for age\n\nBoth satisfy Dretske-style information, both can ground representation, and both admit calibration. Thus, \u201csensing\u201d should be understood functionally (information acquisition for guiding behaviour) rather than mechanistically (being hit by the property sensed).\n\nVII. Wider Implications  \n\n1. Taxonomy of the senses. Recognising endogenous-dynamics sensing supports expanding the list beyond the canonical five. The sense of balance (vestibular) already straddles the border: it relies on inertial forces rather than environmental \u201csubstances.\u201d A sense of time extends the trend.  \n\n2. Embodied cognition. Timing mechanisms are distributed\u2014cardiac rhythms, motor resonances, cortical oscillations. Understanding them as sensory emphasises continual feedback between bodily states and cognitive timing.  \n\n3. AI and robotics. Artificial agents require temporal representations. The argument licenses treating internal oscillators and Kalman-filter-based interval estimators in robots as sensory modules, guiding design of adaptive architectures without external chronometers.\n\nVIII. Conclusion  \n\nClocks teach us that causal impingement by the target magnitude is not the only road to information. When a process\u2019s lawful dynamics embed a stable parameter, later states can stand in for that parameter, enabling genuine measurement. Time is the paradigm of such a parameter. Biological and artefactual clocks, exploiting oscillation, decay, or cumulative integration, therefore constitute legitimate sensory systems for time. The causal impotence of time poses no obstacle; what matters is reliable, exploitable covariance.

(i) Sensory systems work only when the sensed feature exerts a causal influence on the apparatus\u2014photons strike the retina, air-pressure waves jostle cochlear hair cells, chemicals bind to olfactory receptors. (ii) Time, unlike light or odorant molecules, is not the sort of thing that can impinge on a receptor; it is \u201ccausally impotent.\u201d (iii) Hence there can be no genuine time-sense\u2014what we call \u201cfeeling the passage of time\u201d must be an illusion or a cognitive inference, not perception.\n\nI shall argue that the second step rests on a confusion between \u200bcausal source\u200b and \u200binformation carrier\u200b. A mechanism can carry information about a magnitude even when that magnitude is not itself an independent causal agent, provided that law-like regularities guarantee a reliable correlation between the mechanism\u2019s states and the magnitude\u2019s values. A clock\u2014whether the suprachiasmatic nucleus in a mammal or a cesium fountain in a laboratory\u2014illustrates the point: its moving parts are not pushed around by \u201ctime,\u201d but because their dynamics instantiate a temporally invariant pattern, their successive states encode how much time has elapsed. Once this confusion is cleared, the claim that there is no sensory system for time loses its force.\n\n2.\u2003Why \u201cDirect\u201d Causation Is Not a Requirement for Representation  \nThe objection tacitly endorses what we might call the \u200bContact Doctrine\u200b: A representational state R can carry information about property P only if P itself affects R through a dedicated causal channel. But many uncontroversial cases violate the doctrine.\n\nTemperature.  A cold receptor is triggered by molecular collisions, not by \u201cdegree Celsius.\u201d What makes the receptor sensitive to temperature is a lawful regularity: within the relevant range, mean molecular kinetic energy covaries with collision rate, and collision rate affects the receptor. The semantic link to temperature is mediated, not direct.\n\nMagnetic-field lines.  A compass needle does not register \u201cnorthness.\u201d It responds to a vector sum of electromagnetic forces. Because that sum is lawfully related to the Earth\u2019s field, we treat the needle as representing direction. Again, representation flows via reliable correlation, not direct action of \u201cnorthness\u201d on metal.\n\nTemporal order is no different in principle. If there are physical processes whose evolution respects stable temporal invariants\u2014periodic oscillations, exponential decay, constant rates of flow\u2014then those processes can be harnessed as indicators of temporal magnitude even though no separate entity called \u200btime\u200b pushes on them.\n\n3.\u2003From Correlation to Semantic Content: A Minimal Theory  \nSuppose state s of mechanism M occurs iff magnitude T (elapsed time since some zero-point) falls within interval I. Claude Shannon showed that mutual information is indifferent to whether the correlation is mediated by another variable. Fred Dretske (1981) and Karen Neander (2017) added that natural selection (or learning) can exploit the correlation so that s \u200bfunctions\u200b to indicate T \u2208 I. When that etiological condition is satisfied, s \u200bmeans\u200b \u201cT is in I.\u201d Note what is \u200bnot\u200b required:\n\n\u2022 An energy packet traveling from an abstract entity called Time to the sensor;  \n\u2022 A dedicated time-particle;  \n\u2022 Even a metaphysical substance \u201cflowing.\u201d\n\nWhat \u200bis\u200b required is a stable nomic link, plus a system that uses the link for guidance\u2014exactly what we find in ordinary clocks and in neural timing circuits.\n\n4.\u2003How Clocks Work Without Time Pushing on Them  \nIt helps to distinguish two clock architectures.\n\n4.1\u2003Exogenous-driver clocks: hourglasses, sundials, water clocks  \nThese devices rely on a process whose rate is fixed by (or tightly correlated with) environmental regularities:\n\n\u2022 An hourglass uses the constant acceleration of gravity and the quasi-constant aperture size.  \n\u2022 A sundial exploits the rotational period of the Earth relative to the Sun.  \n\nIn neither case does \u201ctime\u201d hit the apparatus. Grains of sand fall and cast shadows move because of gravity and angular momentum conservation. Those physical processes supply an information-bearing \u200bsignal\u200b\u2014the height of the sand pile, the shadow angle\u2014from which elapsed time can be read.\n\n4.2\u2003Endogenous-oscillator clocks: balance wheels, quartz crystals, atomic standards, circadian pacemakers  \nThese devices isolate a dynamical subsystem whose period is highly stable given the relevant boundary conditions. The balance wheel\u2019s periodicity depends on moment of inertia I and torsional stiffness \u03ba; quartz crystals depend on piezoelectric coupling; atomic clocks depend on hyperfine transition frequencies fixed by constants of nature. If N oscillations have occurred, then elapsed time \u2248 N \u00d7 (period). The causal story involves elastic forces, electromagnetic interactions, and quantum transitions; wherein lies the \u201ctime causal influence\u201d? Nowhere. Rather, the oscillation embodies a \u200bsymmetry\u200b: the laws governing the subsystem are (approximately) invariant under time translation, yielding a conserved quantity (energy) that, in turn, supports a stable period. By coupling a counter to the oscillator, engineers convert that lawful invariance into usable temporal information.\n\n5.\u2003From Clocks to Biological Time-Sensing  \nThe brain\u2019s timing capacities fit the same template.\n\n5.1\u2003Millisecond range: interval timing for speech and music  \nCortical-basal-ganglia circuits exhibit ramping neuron populations whose firing rate integrates a constant input (due to the properties of NMDA receptors and recurrent excitation). Because dv/dt \u2248 k, the time to reach threshold ~ (\u03b8/k). The causal input is synaptic current; the semantic target is duration.\n\n5.2\u2003Second-to-minute range: striatal beat-frequency model  \nDopaminergic inputs reset a bank of cortical oscillators with slightly different periods. The pattern of phase coincidence evolves deterministically; downstream neurons detect particular coincidence patterns corresponding to elapsed intervals. Oscillations are driven by membrane currents, not by \u201ctime,\u201d yet reliably map onto \u200bhow long\u200b has passed.\n\n5.3\u2003Circadian range  \nThe molecular clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus is a transcription-translation feedback loop with a period of ~24 h, entrained by light-induced signaling cascades. The loop\u2019s biochemical causal structure endows each phase state with information about the day-night cycle. Light photons initiate entrainment; \u201ctime of day\u201d itself imparts no causal jolt.\n\n6.\u2003Anticipating and Answering Objections  \nObjection 1: \u200bCorrelation is not enough; the device might continue to oscillate even if time stopped\u2014so it would misrepresent.\u200b  \nReply: \u201cTime stopping\u201d is either incoherent (most physical theories define time via change) or else a wholesale breakdown of the nomic background. In that scenario, \u200ball\u200b reference breaks down: thermometers mis-register temperatures when laws change, compasses fail if electromagnetism disappears. Vacuous possibility is no threat to ordinary representational legitimacy.\n\nObjection 2: \u200bPhotoreceptors are acted on by photons; temporal receptors would need an analogous contact with chronons, else they differ in kind.\u200b  \nReply: The analogy fails even for spatial vision. Photoreceptors are not sensitive to \u200bdistance\u200b yet vision represents distance, shape, and motion by processing patterns across retinal arrays. Likewise, a time-sense may synthesize information distributed across internal changes. Representation outruns proximal stimulation.\n\nObjection 3: \u200bEndogenous oscillators measure only themselves; without external calibration they drift.\u200b  \nReply: True\u2014and exactly parallel worries hold for any sense organ. The retina yields ambiguous 2-D images; calibration via stereopsis, vergence, and learning corrects them. Circadian clocks synch via morning light; interval clocks re-calibrate via dopaminergic prediction errors. Dependence on calibration does not negate sensing; it just shows that sensing is interactive.\n\nObjection 4: \u200bThe alleged sense of time is reconstructive and thus cognitive, not sensory.\u200b  \nReply: The distinction between \u201cperceptual\u201d and \u201ccognitive\u201d is graded. If the processes are automatic, encapsulated, and feed downstream behavior (e.g., saccadic suppression of chronostasis) without propositional mediation, they meet standard criteria for perceptual systems. Current empirical work (e.g., Eagleman, 2008) shows precisely such low-level temporal illusions.\n\n7.\u2003A Revealing Distinction: Carrier vs. Source  \nThe foregoing cases suggest a conceptual tool not yet standard but useful. Let\n\n\u2022 The \u200bcarrier\u200b of information for magnitude M be the physical variable C whose values covary lawfully with M and interact causally with the sensor.  \n\u2022 The \u200bsource\u200b be M itself.\n\nFor olfaction, \u200bcarrier\u200b = volatile molecules; \u200bsource\u200b = chemical identity. For clocks, \u200bcarrier\u200b = phase of oscillation (or height of sand, etc.); \u200bsource\u200b = elapsed time. The Contact Doctrine is driven by conflating carrier with source. Once they are prised apart, we see that many sensory systems detect their targets by being causally affected by carriers that happen to track the target. The sense of time employs internal carriers (neural phases, decay of integrators) whose link to time is backed by environmental or evolutionary calibration. Nothing metaphysically suspicious lurks here.\n\n8.\u2003An Information-Theoretic Sketch of a Clock  \nTo make matters fully explicit, consider a quartz watch.\n\nLet \u03c6(t) be the phase of its quartz oscillator at physical time t. The piezoelectric effect yields a differential equation  \n\u2003d\u00b2x/dt\u00b2 + (2\u03c0f)\u00b2x = 0,  where f \u2248 32,768 Hz.  \nCount cycles with an integer-valued variable n(t) updated at each zero crossing; drive the display every 32,768 counts. The causal pathway is  \n\u2003Crystal deformation \u2192 electrical signal \u2192 flip-flop counter \u2192 gear train \u2192 hand position.  \nMutual information I(n; t) is maximized under the assumption of frequency stability. No term \u201ctime\u201d appears on the right-hand side of the causal chain. Nevertheless the Shannon channel (n \u2192 t) carries log\u2082(#counts) bits about elapsed seconds. Under an etiological semantics, the function of n is to indicate t, because the device was designed and selected for that task.\n\n9.\u2003Does Time Have Any Causal Role at All?  \nOne might wonder whether I have conceded too much: perhaps time does, after all, exert causal influence by governing the dynamical laws that yield stable oscillations. If so, the original objection collapses for a different reason\u2014the premise that time is causally impotent is false. On many formulations of mechanics (Hamiltonian, Lagrangian) the time parameter is part of the explanatory machinery. Whether to treat that parameter as a \u201ccause\u201d in the everyday sense is a debated metaphysical question, but the epistemic moral is clear: either clocks represent time because they are pushed by time (the objection fails), or clocks represent time by exploiting lawful correlations without such pushing (the objection fails). The dilemma is fatal to the objector.\n\n10.\u2003Why This Counts as a Genuine Sense  \nA sensory modality, by most cognitive-scientific standards, (i) supplies organisms with non-inferential information, (ii) is subserved by specialized receptor and processing pathways, and (iii) can be selectively impaired. Interval-timing studies reveal exactly this profile: pharmacological manipulation of striatal dopamine shifts perceived duration; lesions of the cerebellum degrade millisecond timing; genetic knockouts of Per2 disrupt circadian phase perception. Hence the \u201ctime-sense\u201d satisfies operational criteria for genuine sensation even though its carriers are endogenously generated.\n\n11.\u2003Residual Worries About Illusion  \nHumans systematically misperceive long intervals (Vierordt\u2019s Law) and short flashes (subjective slowing under threat). But every modality has characteristic illusions (color constancy errors, auditory streaming). Illusoriness undermines only simplistic \u200bna\u00efve realism\u200b, not the existence of a sense organ. Indeed, the pattern of illusions itself furnishes evidence for specialized temporal coding.\n\n12.\u2003Conclusion: From Confusion to Clarity  \nThe objection that time cannot be sensed because time is not a causal agent conflates the metaphysical structure of causation with the informational structure of representation. Clocks\u2014mechanical, atomic, or neural\u2014convert lawful, temporally invariant dynamics into signals usable for action. They do so by coupling a \u200bcarrier\u200b variable that is causally accessible to the device with the \u200bsource\u200b variable of temporal magnitude. Once we separate these roles, we see that direct causal impingement by the represented property is unnecessary. A sense of time is thus no more mysterious than a sense of temperature or direction. The philosophical moral is broader: representation by \u200btracking\u200b does not require \u201cenergy flow\u201d from the represented property, only a stable, exploitable correlation secured by the laws of nature and the design (biological or artifactual) of the system.\n\nApproximately 2,050 words.", "output_tokens": 3701, "reasoning_tokens": 896}

Framing the Challenge  \n\nTo perceive colour your eyes must be causally struck by certain wavelengths of light; to perceive pitch your ears must be set trembling by pressure waves of the corresponding frequency.  These observations have suggested to many philosophers that *any* genuine sensory system must be driven, at bottom, by causal traffic from the relevant environmental property to the organism.  Time, however, is commonly thought to be causally inert.  Unlike photons or air-pressure fluctuations, \u201cthe mere passage of t\u201d does not push, pull, impinge, or in any other way exert force on cortical tissue.  Hence (the objection concludes) there can be no *sense* of time\u2014only higher-level inference or memory that reconstructs durations retrospectively.\n\nI shall argue that this objection mis-locates where causal work has to be done for information to be available.  A sensory system does not require *direct* causal energy from the target property; it requires a *reliable causal correlation* between states of the system and states of the world.  Because physical laws ensure that *every* continuous dynamical system is lawfully parameterised by time, suitably engineered mechanisms can exploit purely internal dynamics to generate just such correlations.  A clock, biological or artefactual, thus carries usable information about elapsed time even though time exerts no force on it.  In short:\n\nThesis: A device or neural subsystem counts as a time-sense when (i) its internal state space is lawfully indexed to elapsed time by virtue of its own dynamics, (ii) the correlation is stable enough to be exploited for control or prediction, and (iii) the correlation is not accidental but underwrites the teleofunction of the mechanism.  Direct causal influence from time is unnecessary because the physical evolution of any system already *encodes* time within its state transitions.\n\nThe argument proceeds in four steps.  First, I expose the tacit \u201cimpact requirement\u201d at work in the objection and show why it is overly demanding.  Second, I compare time-sensing to familiar cases in which we already allow perception of causally impotent properties (speed, number, probability).  Third, I analyse clock mechanisms\u2014pendular, quartz, atomic, and biological\u2014in information-theoretic terms, spelling out how they come to *carry* temporal information.  Finally, I address three worries: (a) that the correlation is merely accidental, (b) that without an external time signal the device cannot detect drift, and (c) that genuine sensation requires dedicated receptors rather than self-generated rhythms.  Each worry can be quelled once we shift from an \u201cimpact\u201d model of sensation to a \u201ccovariance plus function\u201d model.\n\n2. Why the Impact Requirement Over-reaches  \n\nThe classical sense modalities do indeed involve energy transfer: photons excite opsins, compressions bend hair cells, volatile chemicals dock with olfactory receptors.  The temptation is to treat this as *definitional* of sensory systems.  Yet even in paradigmatic perception the environmental property we claim to sense is often not the one doing causal work.  Two quick illustrations make the point.\n\nExample 1:  A speedometer \u201cperceives\u201d speed (distance per unit time).  What physically drives the needle is rotational motion of a magnet; but speed as such exerts no unique force.  The needle tracks speed because the rotational frequency of the magnet *covaries* with speed given the mechanical constraints of the vehicle.  What matters is the lawful mapping from speeds to needle positions, not that \u201cspeed pushes the gauge.\u201d\n\nExample 2:  Consider perceiving *probability* in a random dot kinetogram.  The retina is hit by individual photons, but what subjects report is the *proportion* of dots moving rightwards.  The property perceived\u2014probability\u2014is abstract and causally impotent; the informational purchase stems from statistical regularities over many causal micro-events.\n\nThese examples show a general pattern: sensing a property P requires (i) causal interactions *somewhere* in the chain, (ii) a stable mapping from P to some detectible feature S of those interactions, and (iii) a consumer that uses S *as* information about P.  Direct causal potency of P itself is optional.\n\nThe same pattern can hold for time.  All dynamical systems instantiate states S(t) that evolve according to laws dS/dt = F(S).  Because elapsed time monotonically orders state transitions, one can design mechanisms whose *current* state reliably covaries with how much time has passed since a reference event.  Time never \u201cimpacts\u201d the device; rather, the device *rides* law-governed change to mark time\u2019s passage.\n\n3. From Covariance to Representation:  The Architecture of Clocks  \n\nLet me put flesh on that abstract schema by walking through three increasingly sophisticated clock types.\n\n3.1 The Pendulum Clock  \n\nThe period T of a pendulum of length L is (to first order) 2\u03c0\u221a(L/g).  Once set swinging, the bob\u2019s angular displacement \u03b8(t) is periodic with phase \u03c6(t) = \u03c9t + \u03c6\u2080.  Counting zero-crossings therefore yields a monotonic tally of elapsed seconds.  What causally moves the escapement gear is gravitational torque and inertial momentum\u2014not \u201ctime.\u201d  Yet because \u03c6(t) = \u03c9t, the gear\u2019s state carries mutual information H(\u03c6; t) that approaches log\u2082(N) bits for N swings observed.  The lawlike regularity establishes the covariance; engineering (isochronous anthropic constant length, temperature-compensated rods) improves reliability.\n\n3.2 The Quartz Oscillator  \n\nA slice of \u03b2-quartz exhibits piezo-electricity: mechanical strain produces voltage and vice versa.  When cut at the right angle and driven into resonance, it vibrates at 32 768 Hz.  The crystal\u2019s molecular lattice and the circuit\u2019s feedback loop create an attractor whose periodicity is extraordinarily stable across voltage fluctuations.  Again, nothing external needs to bang the crystal once it is driven; the system\u2019s own dynamics maintain the mapping t \u21a6 phase.  Dividing down the high-frequency square wave by binary counters realises the familiar one-second pulse.  Digital \u201ctemporal information\u201d is implemented in registers that increment once per pulse.  The causal pathway runs: lattice forces \u2192 mechanical strain \u2192 voltage \u2192 logic gate; time does not appear as a distinct force term.\n\n3.3 The Circadian Clock in the Suprachiasmatic Nucleus (SCN)  \n\nBiological organisms display free-running oscillations with periods close to 24 h.  In mammals the SCN achieves this via transcription-translation feedback loops: CLOCK and BMAL1 proteins promote transcription of PER and CRY; accumulated PER/CRY dimers ultimately inhibit CLOCK/BMAL1, causing levels to fall and the cycle to restart.  Mutations stretching or shortening degradation rates lengthen or shorten behavioural periods, demonstrating that it is *chemical kinetics* that push the cycle, not time\u2019s mystical tug.  Yet the organism exploits phase information to anticipate dawn, regulate body temperature, and schedule hormone release.  When present, zeitgeber stimuli (light pulses) entrain the oscillator, fixing \u03c6 = 0 at sunrise, but in constant darkness the SCN continues to \u201cknow\u201d the hour as accurately as any wristwatch left indoors.\n\nAcross these cases we see the same structure: intrinsic dynamics create lawful, stable phase-time covariance; the system counts phase cycles; downstream consumers treat the count as information about duration.  Causal energy flows among physical variables other than time, but the mapping is robust enough that treating the device as a *time sensor* is explanatorily indispensable.\n\n4. Meeting the Objections  \n\nObjection A:  \u201cCorrelation without causation is mere coincidence.\u201d  \nReply:  What matters is *non-accidental* correlation.  Teleosemantics or etiological functionalism offers a neat criterion: a state S represents property P when S has the function (selected by evolution or design) of indicating P because of a history in which S-P correlations caused beneficial outcomes.  Pendulum lengths were chosen, quartz cuts refined, and SCN loops conserved precisely because they delivered behaviourally useful time information.  Accidental correlations would not persist under selection nor be worth the engineer\u2019s expense.  Thus the covariance here is not lucky; it is the very reason the mechanism exists in its current form.\n\nObjection B:  \u201cWithout an external time signal the device cannot detect or correct drift, so it doesn\u2019t really know the time.\u201d  \nReply:  Two distinctions help.  (i) *Interval* vs *calendar* time: a stopwatch need only measure intervals; calibration to an absolute standard is unnecessary.  (ii) *Representation* vs *accuracy*: miscalibrated thermometers still represent temperature, albeit inaccurately.  Likewise, a quartz watch that has lost five seconds is still a time sensor; it is just a noisy one.  In biological cases the sun or social cues can provide periodic recalibration, but recalibration is not constitutive of temporal representation itself.\n\nObjection C:  \u201cGenuine senses have dedicated receptors that transduce external stimuli; clocks are self-contained and so resemble inference, not perception.\u201d  \nReply:  The taxonomy of senses has already expanded beyond classical exteroception.  Proprioception, nociception, and vestibular balance all rely heavily on internal signals (muscle spindle stretch, tissue damage, hair-cell inertia).  The vestibular system, in particular, employs the *endogenous* dynamics of fluid in the semicircular canals to detect angular acceleration; we do not deem it inferential.  The divide, therefore, is not internal vs external but *direct, ongoing informational coupling* vs retrospective reconstruction.  Clocks maintain coupling by continuously evolving, not by episodic reasoning over stored memories.  Experimentally, SCN lesion in rodents abolishes learned anticipation of feeding times even though hippocampal memory remains, confirming that timing and memory dissociate behaviourally.\n\n5. Distinctions that Clarify the Terrain  \n\nSeveral conceptual distinctions help avoid conflation.\n\n5.1 Parameter vs Force Distinction  \nTime is a *parameter* in dynamical laws, not a *force*.  Sensory systems can track parameters provided there is a lawful S(t) mapping.  Temperature also began as a parameter in thermodynamics; mercury provides the S.  Gauge fields need not themselves slam into receptors.\n\n5.2 Relational vs Intrinsic Property  \nColour and pain are intrinsic properties of perceptual states; duration is relational (between two moments).  Tracking a relational property often requires memory or oscillation.  That fact explains why time-sensing mechanisms are always extended in time (pacemaker-accumulator, oscillators, delay lines), not point receptors.  The objection under scrutiny mistakes this *architectural* consequence of relationality for evidence of non-sensation.\n\n5.3 Exteroceptive vs Proprioceptive Timing  \nHumans possess multiple timing systems: millisecond-range interval timing in the cerebellum and basal ganglia, circadian timing in the SCN, and prospective timing that utilises cortical beta oscillations.  Some are entrained exteroceptively (light), others run proprioceptively (striatal dopamine pulses).  A unified account need not treat them identically; what unites them is lawful state-time covariance exploited by the organism.\n\n6. Information-Theoretic Formalisation  \n\nLet T be a random variable over elapsed time since reference event t\u2080, with prior distribution p(t).  Let C be the clock\u2019s current internal state (phase, gear position, gene-expression vector).  Physical law plus initial conditions induce a conditional distribution p(c | t).  The mutual information I(T;C) quantifies how much knowing C reduces uncertainty about T.  A perfect clock achieves I = H(T).  Time\u2019s causal impotency is irrelevant; all that is required is that p(c | t) be sharply peaked for each t.  Engineering (or evolution) tunes system parameters to maximise I under noise and drift constraints.  This formalisation captures why clocks are *better* or *worse* sensors without appealing to metaphysical forces.\n\n7. Repercussions for the Philosophy of Perception  \n\nRecognising clocks as legitimate time-senses has three broader implications.\n\n7.1 Modality Pluralism  \nIt bolsters the view that sense modalities are individuated by computational role, not receptor anatomy.  Timing fulfils a unique ecological role\u2014coordinating action with periodic events, predicting regularities\u2014sufficient to merit modality status even if its \u201creceptors\u201d are pacemaker neurons.\n\n7.2 Reconciling B-Theoretic Time with Temporal Phenomenology  \nIf clocks index time without being acted upon by time, the B-theorist (who denies a flowing present) can still explain rich temporal phenomenology.  The seeming \u201cflow\u201d emerges from representational dynamics, not from metaphysical becoming.\n\n7.3 Methodological Lessons  \nThe case shows the risk of projecting metaphysical assumptions about properties onto epistemic mechanisms.  Thermometers do not require a \u201ctemperature force,\u201d nor do compasses need a \u201cdirection force\u201d to sense north.  We should expect similar indirect strategies in neural information gathering.\n\n8. Conclusion  \n\nThe absence of a causal \u201cpush\u201d from time poses no special problem for temporal sensation.  What any sensory system needs is (a) causal interactions within the mechanism that evolve lawfully, (b) a reliable, exploitable correlation between those internal states and the environmental property of interest, and (c) historical or design-based anchoring of that correlation to the system\u2019s function.  Clocks\u2014mechanical, electronic, and biological\u2014satisfy these criteria in abundance.  They track time the way speedometers track speed: by converting dynamics that necessarily unfold in time into state variables consumable by further processes.  Once we replace the Impact Requirement with a Covariance-and-Function framework, the supposed impossibility of a time sense dissolves, and with it a venerable impediment to understanding how organisms so effortlessly live in synchrony with the temporal structure of their worlds.", "output_tokens": 3851, "reasoning_tokens": 832}

If sensory systems must be driven by causal impingement from the very feature they detect, then, because time itself does not hit, bump, or flow into anything, there is no genuine sense of time. My aim is to show that this objection rests on a misunderstanding of both what it is to carry information and how biological or artefactual clocks work. Once we have the right picture of representation, the causal impotence of time ceases to be a problem. Roughly, clocks\u2014neural or mechanical\u2014encode time not because time exerts a proprietary force on them but because their own ongoing causal dynamics stand in a law-like, reliable covariation with temporal magnitudes. Time leaves its \u201cfingerprints\u201d in the lawful evolution of states, and that is enough for sensory registration.\n\n1. Clarifying the burden of the objection  \n\n       (O) In order for a system S to sense feature F, F must causally influence S.\n       (I) Time does not causally influence anything; it is not a force or energy source.\n       (C) Therefore, no system can sense time.\n\nTwo clarifications are essential. First, (O) is stronger than many causal theories of perception actually require. Most contemporary information-theoretic or teleosemantic accounts speak of reliable covariance under appropriate counterfactual conditions, not of direct causal influence by the very property represented. Second, (I) is ambiguous between two claims:\n\n   (I1) Time exerts no sui generis force.  \n   (I2) Nothing about the causal evolution of physical systems can be informative about time.\n\nOnly (I1) is plausible. (I2) is demonstrably false: pendulums, radioactive decay chains, and sodium-potassium oscillations in the brain all exhibit temporal regularities from which elapsed time can be read. The puzzle, then, is why (I1) seems to threaten representation when (I2) does not. The answer lies in conflating two quite different modes of information transmission: exogenous impingement and endogenous unfolding.\n\n2. Two ways to carry information  \n\nExogenous sensing: A variable outside the system directly modulates the system\u2019s states\u2014photons flip retinal opsins, airborne molecules bind olfactory receptors. The sensed magnitude is an external cause of the receptor state.\n\nEndogenous timing: The system is set into motion once (by winding, by initial conditions, by routine metabolism) and thereafter passes through a succession of states in accord with physical laws. Because the mapping from state to elapsed time is highly reliable\u2014indeed nomologically necessary\u2014the system\u2019s later states carry as much information about temporal distance from the start as retinal signals carry about wavelength composition of incident light. Here the sensor does not wait for repeated causal pushes from the magnitude it represents; rather, it \u201creads itself\u201d as it lawfully evolves.\n\nNotably, thermometers lie somewhere between these poles. The mercury column rises because molecular kinetic energy from the surrounding medium agitates it, so temperature both causes and covaries with expansion. But the expansion is mediated by more fundamental forces (electromagnetic interactions), not by a bespoke \u201ctemperature force.\u201d That does not stop the device from measuring temperature. Likewise, pendulums measure time although the restoring force is gravity, not some direct \u201ctempus force.\u201d\n\n3. A simple mechanical case: the balance-spring watch  \n\nConsider a balance wheel attached to a spiral spring. Once energized, the wheel oscillates at a frequency determined (within engineering tolerances) by its moment of inertia I and the spring constant \u03ba. The differential equation \u03b8\u0308 = \u2212(\u03ba/I) \u03b8 entails a period T = 2\u03c0 \u221a(I/\u03ba). After n oscillations the watch\u2019s gear train has advanced n steps, moving the hands accordingly. Reading the hand positions yields the value nT, that is, the elapsed time.\n\nWhat caused the wheel gradually to reach orientation \u03b8 at moment t? Not time as such, but the local restoring torque \u03ba\u03b8 and the wheel\u2019s own inertia. Nevertheless the mapping between gear-train state G and elapsed time t is rigid: had the watch been started one second later, G would have lagged by precisely one second. The device\u2019s subsequent states are lawful functions of the initial state and the governing equation. If we adopt Fred Dretske\u2019s indicator semantics, state G indicates duration d exactly because P(d|G) \u2248 1 across normal operating ranges. No extra \u201ctime force\u201d is required.\n\n4. Biological analogues: circadian and interval timing  \n\nThe suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in mammals is a biochemical oscillator. Transcription-translation feedback loops involving the Period and Clock genes generate near-24-hour rhythms in protein concentration. Light exposure each morning entrains the oscillator, but once entrained the system free-runs: the rising and falling concentrations themselves drive cyclical downstream effects (body temperature, hormone release), and these molecular states constitute an internal clock. Again, temporal information is carried by endogenous dynamics. What affects the SCN at noon is not \u201cnoonness\u201d but the concentration gradient produced by earlier transcription events.\n\nInterval timing on the scale of seconds to minutes exhibits a similar architecture. Neural models such as the Striatal Beat-Frequency account posit that cortical neurons with slightly different oscillatory frequencies create a transient coincidence pattern at characteristic intervals. The pacemaker neurons are not hit repeatedly by a \u201cten-second force.\u201d Instead, their phase relations unfold predictably. When the striatum detects a particular phase vector, it can treat that vector as a token of a ten-second interval. Behavioral evidence\u2014peak-interval procedures, temporal bisection tasks\u2014confirms that animals possess such internal chronometers.\n\n5. Objection: covariance without causation is epistemically inert  \n\nA critic might insist that lawful covariance is not enough. If a barometer happens to match stock-market fluctuations, the match is accidental and not a ground for representation. The defender of time-sensing must explain why clock-state/time covariance is non-accidental.\n\nThe standard move is to invoke etiology or function. A trait represents what it was selected\u2014or constructed\u2014to indicate. Watches are engineered to couple hand angle with elapsed seconds because that mapping satisfies designers\u2019 purposes. Neural clocks are shaped by evolutionary pressures favoring organisms that anticipate regular environmental cycles. In Ruth Millikan\u2019s teleosemantics, a state\u2019s proper function is what past reliance on that state secured. Because organisms that used SCN phase to regulate feeding and sleep out-reproduced those that did not, the phase comes to function as a representation of time of day. The covariance is not incidental; it is the very reason the system exists.\n\n6. Objection: representation requires causal intake of new information  \n\nAnother line of attack: A system that only evolves from its initial conditions cannot respond to unexpected changes. A wound watch removed from its owner continues to tick, but its states no longer tell her what time it is relative to Earth\u2019s rotation; without periodic re-synchronization, drift sets in. So perhaps clocks do not really sense time; they merely simulate it until recalibrated.\n\nBut the need for calibration plagues every sensory modality. Retinas bleach, cochlear hairs fatigue, thermoreceptors adapt. Maintenance inputs are routine; they do not undermine the claim that vision, audition, and thermoreception are senses. What matters is that, between calibrations, the system is under the control of the environmental magnitude in question in virtue of a reliable information-channel. For clocks, that control is mediated through physical law plus initial synchronization (sunlight entrainment for circadian clocks, NTP packets for your laptop). Thus, even when no new photons specially marked \u201ctime\u201d arrive, the system continues to carry information about time, just as a retina carries information about color during a fixation despite no fresh photons arriving from the peripheral scene.\n\n7. A deeper moral: time as structural cause  \n\nWhy are we tempted to demand a dedicated time-force? Because we tacitly privilege \u201cevent-to-event contact\u201d causation. Yet much of physics teaches a more structural notion: to explain why a double pendulum traces a Lissajous curve we appeal to constraint equations, not forces from geometry. Time is the parameter in the differential equations governing every dynamical system. When a system\u2019s state at t1 causes its state at t2, time is a structural, not token, cause\u2014what Nancy Cartwright calls a nomological machine. The dependence of later on earlier states is intelligible only by reference to temporal metrics. Clocks exploit that dependence: they are physical implementations whose deterministic or stochastic evolution is monotonic with elapsed time. So if one grants that structural causes supply legitimate information channels, the prima facie causal impotence of time is no bar to temporal representation.\n\n8. Bringing it back to sensing  \n\nDoes this show that we literally have a \u201csense of time\u201d? Two caveats:\n\nA. There is unlikely to be a single dedicated receptor organ; rather, multiple specialized timing subsystems function at different scales (microsecond auditory localization, millisecond motor control, seconds-to-minutes interval timing, circadian and circalunar rhythms). Vision, too, fractures into rods, cones, motion detectors, and parvocellular or magnocellular streams. Unity of modality need not mean unitary receptor.\n\nB. Temporal phenomenology involves integrative processing that combines outputs from many internal clocks with exteroceptive content. Still, the objection under discussion was metaphysical, not phenomenological: could any sensor provide genuinely temporal information? The foregoing shows that biological and artefactual clocks do exactly that.\n\n9. Answering the guiding question explicitly  \n\nHow can a clock carry information about time without time itself causally influencing it? Because:\n\n1. The clock\u2019s mechanism instantiates a dynamical law whose independent variable is time.  \n2. Given an initial condition (start signal, winding, photon pulse), the system\u2019s later states are law-bound functions of elapsed time.  \n3. Therefore, a mapping f: state \u2192 duration exists such that, for all normal operating conditions, reading state s yields the true duration t = f(s).  \n4. Information-theoretically (in Shannon\u2019s sense), mutual information I(S;T) is high.  \n5. Teleologically, the mechanism was built or selected precisely to exploit that mapping, elevating the covariance from brute fact to representational function.\n\nConsequently, temporal information flows through causal intermediaries (oscillations, chemical reactions, decay processes) rather than through a proprietary \u201ctime particle.\u201d The objection trades on a caricature of causation and of sensory representation; once those caricatures are set aside, the path is clear for a perfectly naturalized sense of time.\n\n10. Epilogue: lessons for philosophy of perception  \n\nThe debate echoes earlier worries about color. Light of 700 nm does not itself \u201ccause red\u201d; it merely excites L-cones. Color is a relational construct built on stable correlations. Temporal sensing extends the same lesson: what matters in perception is not being pushed around by color, temperature, or time itself, but being appropriately embedded in causal-nomological patterns that license reliable inference. The retina that can be fooled by colored filters and the clock that can be fooled by relativistic time dilation are nevertheless genuine sensors by any scientifically respectable standard. To demand more is to fetishize a na\u00efve model of causal contact that the rest of perceptual science has long since outgrown.\n\nAbout 2,000 words.", "output_tokens": 3320, "reasoning_tokens": 896}

Introduction and Thesis  \n\nOne of the most persistent intuitions in the philosophy of perception is that sensing is a matter of being *struck* by the world. Photons impinge on the retina; pressure waves buffet the cochlea; odorant molecules latch onto receptors. On this model, a feature must \u201cpush\u201d on the sensory organ if that organ is to carry information about it. Time, however, appears to do no pushing. If causal efficacy is a criterion for being sensed, then\u2014so the objection goes\u2014there can be no genuine sense of time, either in animals or in clocks.  \n\nI will argue that the objection trades on an equivocation about what it takes for a physical system to *carry information* about an environmental magnitude. While it is true that nothing like a \u201ctime particle\u201d bombards clockwork or neural tissue, systems can nevertheless come to *lawfully covary* with temporal structure. What matters for sensing is nomic (law-governed) dependence, not direct causal impact by a sui generis temporal entity.  \n\nThe core of my proposal is a *relational\u2013mechanistic account*.  (1) Relational: time is not an independent causal ingredient but an ordering relation among events; representation of time is therefore grounded in relations that hold *between* internal states, not in an extra influx of time-stuff.  (2) Mechanistic: clocks\u2014biological and artificial\u2014are built around self-propagating processes whose successive states stand in precisely specifiable temporal ratios. Those internal transitions, when suitably calibrated and coupled to acting or believing subsystems, constitute sensing time.  \n\nHence: a mechanism M can carry information about duration D not because \u201ctime causes state S of M,\u201d but because (i) there is a stable, counterfactual-supporting mapping from determinate durations to determinate states of M, and (ii) the mapping exists in virtue of physical laws governing M\u2019s own dynamics plus an initial calibration interface with the world. Once we free ourselves from a push-model of perception, both ordinary clocks and neural timing circuits emerge as paradigms of genuine sensory systems for time.\n\nThe remainder of the essay develops this reply. Section 2 diagnoses the mistake in the causal-impotence objection. Section 3 builds an informational framework that does not require time to be a causal agent. Section 4 illustrates the framework with thermometers, pendulums, and quartz oscillators. Section 5 extends the account to biological timing, showing how humans and other animals literally \u201csense\u201d time. Section 6 answers three residual objections, and Section 7 concludes with broader implications for perception theory.\n\n2. Two Ways to Mis-Describe Time  \n\nA. Treating Time as an Entity.  \nThe objection presupposes that if time were to be sensed, it would have to stand to the clock as light stands to the eye. But light is a *substance* (photon flux) while time is a *scale of relation*: the systematic pattern in which events succeed one another. Reifying that relational structure into a causal agent is already a category error. Because relations are instantiated *by* the very events they order, they need no additional push.  \n\nB. Conflating \u2018Causally Absorbing\u2019 with \u2018Informationally Dependent\u2019.  \nEven granting the relational nature of time, one might insist that some *cause* must enter the clock from outside if the clock is to be informative. Yet a system can be informative about X provided its states covary with X in a way underwritten by physical law, even if X does not itself impress a dedicated signal upon it. To separate the two notions, consider a hanging calendar. Nothing about Tuesday \u201chits\u201d the paper, yet tearing off one page per day yields true information about what day it is. Dependence, not impact, does the explanatory work.\n\n3. Information without Impact: A Nomic-Covariance Model  \n\nLet us adopt Fred Dretske\u2019s (1981) information-theoretic slogan: a state S of system M carries the information that P when, given background laws L, the probability of P conditional on S is 1. Crucially, the *channel* identified by L can be constituted by M\u2019s own dynamics plus initial and boundary conditions. No special particle has to travel the channel.  \n\nFormally:\n\nLaw-Channel Principle  \nM encodes magnitude \u00b5 if and only if  \n(LC) For each determinate value v of \u00b5 there exists a determinate state s of M such that, under the laws L and given normal operating conditions C, \u00b5 = v \u21d2 M is in s, and  \n(ST) The mapping v \u21a6 s is stable across counterfactual interventions short of breakdown.\n\nWhen the magnitude \u00b5 is a *temporal interval*, the mapping is realized by internal processes whose period or cumulative change is law-fixed. The laws supply the glue; the world need not supply additional causal inputs at each tick.\n\n4. Mechanical Case Studies  \n\n4.1 The Mercury Thermometer  \nTemperature, like time, is often said to be dispositional: it is the mean kinetic energy of micro-particles, not a substance. Yet a rise in ambient temperature correlates with expansion of mercury because of the coefficient of thermal expansion and the rigidity of glass. Here the thermometer tracks temperature through *structural coupling*, not because \u201ctemperature rays\u201d strike it. Debunking the objection for time is easier once we recognize that we unproblematically treat a thermometer as a sensor.\n\n4.2 The Pendulum Clock  \nThe period of a simple pendulum is 2\u03c0\u221a(l/g). After an initial displacement, gravity and inertia guarantee oscillations of near-constant duration, independent of amplitude to first order. The mechanism is *self-propagating*: no further environmental cause besides sustaining potential energy via the escapement is required. Each beat lawfully marks \u2248 1 s, furnishing a reliable v \u21a6 s mapping.\n\n4.3 The Quartz Wristwatch  \nA quartz crystal driven by an electric field vibrates at 32 768 Hz because quantum-mechanical lattice properties fix its piezoelectric resonance. Electronic dividers count transitions, yielding a one-second pulse. Time is sensed here via the *intrinsic rhythmicity* of matter under stable conditions.\n\nIn all three devices, causal input happens mainly at manufacture and sporadic calibration. During ordinary operation, what makes a given state informative about elapsed time is the lawful regularity of internal transitions.\n\n5. Biological Timing: Endogenous Clocks as Sensory Systems  \n\n5.1 Circadian Oscillators  \nThe suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in mammals sustains a near-24-hour transcription-translation feedback loop. Light serves as a *Zeitgeber* that entrains the phase but does not drive each hourly tick. Once entrained, the SCN\u2019s molecular states nomically covary with solar time, enabling downstream circuits to set sleep\u2013wake cycles. That is structural covariance, not impact by a temporal force.\n\n5.2 Interval Timing in the Seconds Range  \nStriatal beat-frequency models posit multiple cortical oscillators with slightly different periods. The striatum detects their coincident phase pattern to estimate elapsed intervals. No external entity labeled \u201ctime\u201d impinges on these oscillators; differential cell-intrinsic decay of activation suffices.\n\n5.3 Millisecond Timing in the Cerebellum  \nPurkinje cells integrate climbing-fiber input with parallel-fiber burst patterns whose synaptic weights encode experienced delays. Plasticity implements the mapping v \u21a6 s over millisecond windows critical for motor coordination. Again, the dependence is internal.\n\nThe point generalizes: whenever a biological system recruits predictable change\u2014ion flux, gene expression, membrane potential decay\u2014and *reads it as duration*, it literally senses time.\n\n6. Replies to Residual Objections  \n\nObjection 1: \u201cLawful covariance just pushes the bump down the rug; why does internal change track *objective* time rather than merely its own idiosyncratic metric?\u201d  \n\nReply: Calibration ties internal processes to wider temporal structure. A quartz watch runs fast in a furnace; accordingly, it *misrepresents* time relative to standard seconds. Error is intelligible precisely because the mapping aims at an external magnitude. The same goes for jet-lagged circadian clocks. Objective time functions as the explanans of misrepresentation, confirming that the mechanism aims at it rather than at self-change per se.\n\nObjection 2: \u201cRelativity teaches that time is frame-dependent; so any putative time sense is hopelessly parochial.\u201d  \n\nReply: Sensory modalities commonly track magnitudes in restricted regimes: human vision registers only 400\u2013700 nm wavelengths; hearing spans roughly 20 Hz\u201320 kHz. Likewise, biological and artifact clocks track *proper time* along their world-lines. That local metric is perfectly objective within the relativistic manifold. Clocks disagree across frames, but so do color detectors under different illuminations. This is epistemic relativity, not conceptual defeat.\n\nObjection 3: \u201cPsychological distortions\u2014time flies when you\u2019re having fun\u2014imply we do not really sense time.\u201d  \n\nReply: Perception is always modulated by attention, arousal, and expectation. Speed-size illusions do not show that we fail to see motion. Distortions merely demonstrate that multiple timing mechanisms (oscillatory, accumulator, state-dependent) compete, and that higher-level priors can re-weight their outputs. That is further evidence for genuine sensory coding: malleability is characteristic of perceptual systems.\n\n7. Conclusion: Diachronic Transduction as Sensing  \n\nA good sensor performs *transduction*: it converts an environmental magnitude into an internal signal usable by the organism or device. In clocks, the conversion is *diachronic*: the mechanism leverages lawful evolution of its own states to mirror temporal intervals. The absence of a pushing \u201ctime particle\u201d is no impediment, for transduction can be realized via internal regularity plus calibration.  \n\nIn vision, photons carry energy that excites photoreceptors; in audition, pressure waves mechano-depolarize hair cells. In chronoperception, the passage of time is written into patterns of neural activity by molecular and electrical processes whose unfolding constitutes the very relation to be sensed. Time is \u201cfelt\u201d not as an external blow but as an internally regimented becoming. That is a difference of mechanism, not of epistemic status.\n\nTherefore, the causal-impotence objection fails. The possibility of a sense of time\u2014and of clocks that keep it\u2014rests on a relational\u2013mechanistic principle: if a system\u2019s lawful self-change can be stably calibrated to durations, then the system *senses* time in everything the term legitimately connotes. Far from being an embarrassment, the absence of temporal impact underscores a philosophically important point: what matters for perception is lawful covariance, not the mode of causal delivery. Recognizing this frees us to study temporal sensing with the same conceptual tools we apply to every other modality and dissolves an old puzzle born of a misdescribed metaphysics of time.\n\n(Word count \u2248 2020)", "output_tokens": 3001, "reasoning_tokens": 640}
