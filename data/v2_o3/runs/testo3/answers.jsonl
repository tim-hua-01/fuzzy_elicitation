Introduction  \n\nPhilosophers working on autonomy and justice have long puzzled over the phenomenon that Amartya Sen, Jon Elster and Martha Nussbaum call adaptive or \u201csour-grapes\u201d preferences. An agent whose life prospects are restricted by poverty, patriarchy, racism, colonisation or illness sometimes comes genuinely to prefer the restricted menu of options she in fact possesses. The girl in a traditional village says that she positively wants early marriage rather than education; an urban poor worker says she is content to eat plain rice at every meal; the migrant cleaner explains that she does not wish to vote because politics is \u201cdirty business.\u201d On the surface these are straightforward exercises of preference and choice. Yet we hesitate to take them as fully autonomous: something seems to have gone wrong when the agent\u2019s very wants have been bent around the shape of external constraints. What exactly accounts for that autonomy deficit?\n\nThree prominent families of answers dominate the literature:\n\n\u2022 Subjectivist or structural accounts, exemplified by Harry Frankfurt\u2019s hierarchical model, focus on the agent\u2019s internal reflective relation to her first-order desires.  \n\u2022 Content-based or substantive accounts claim that certain desires (e.g. to be subordinated, to undergo genital cutting, to remain illiterate) cannot be fully autonomous whatever the agent\u2019s endorsements, because their content is morally objectionable or unworthy.  \n\u2022 Historical or procedural accounts examine the causal story by which the preference was produced\u2014whether it was induced by manipulation, coercion, socialisation, or oppressive social structures that systematically distort agency.\n\nI shall argue that neither the purely subjectivist view nor the pure content-based view satisfactorily captures what is non-autonomous about adaptive preferences. Instead, a historically inflected, socially embedded conception of autonomy\u2014what I will call the Social-Historical Model\u2014best diagnoses the deficit. The key defect in adaptive preferences is that they have been shaped by background conditions that the agent has no reasonable opportunity to contest, conditions that silence counterfactual reflection about worthwhile alternatives. This undermines the agent\u2019s ability to author her practical identity over time. Subjective endorsement remains important, and the moral quality of content still matters, but the decisive explanatory variable is the illegitimate pathway by which the preference is formed and sustained.\n\n2. Adaptive Preferences Described  \n\nAn adaptive preference is a stable desire for option \u00d8 formed in response to the perception that more valuable option \u03a6 is unavailable or too costly to pursue. The agent avoids frustration by reshaping her aspirations downward. Unlike mere revision of plans in the light of new information, adaptive preference formation tends to disguise the role of external deprivation: the agent now sees \u00d8 as intrinsically good for her rather than as a second-best consolation. Jon Elster\u2019s classic illustration is Aesop\u2019s fox who judges the unreachable grapes to be sour; Elster emphasises the irrationality of self-deception. Nussbaum broadens the concern: the rural woman who says \u201cA good daughter never leaves her village\u201d is not simply deceiving herself, but has internalised local norms that keep her from seeing other lives as live options.\n\nThe normative worry is clear. If we take the expressed preference at face value, we risk perpetuating injustice (\u201cshe freely chooses it\u201d). If we reject it outright, we risk paternalism (\u201cwe know her interests better than she does\u201d). A convincing account of autonomy must thread this needle: it should vindicate the intuition that adaptive preferences are less than fully self-governing while explaining why not every case of preference change in response to circumstances is heteronomous.\n\n3. Subjectivist or Hierarchical Models  \n\nFrankfurt (and later Gerald Dworkin) identify autonomy with a certain structure of desires. An agent acts autonomously when her first-order desire (e.g. to marry at fourteen) is endorsed by a higher-order volition with which she identifies (\u201cI wholeheartedly want this desire to move me\u201d). On this view adaptive preferences are non-autonomous only if the agent would on critical reflection dis-identify with them\u2014if, for example, she were to step back and decide that her wish to marry young is not a desire she wants to have. The appeal of the model is its fidelity to liberal respect for persons: what matters is the agent\u2019s own reflective endorsement, not paternalistic judgments by outsiders.\n\nYet the model struggles with hard cases of oppression. Empirical studies show that individuals socialised under constraining norms can and often do wholeheartedly endorse those norms. Consider Okin\u2019s case of women in polygynous societies who express pride in subordinate wifehood, or Khader\u2019s case of Bangladeshi garment workers who prefer unsafe factory labour to rural life. Frankfurt\u2019s criterion then licenses these preferences as autonomous\u2014precisely the conclusion our intuitions resist. We suspect that the wholehearted endorsement itself has been sculpted by background conditions that pre-empt imagination of alternatives; internal reflection, no matter how sincere, can occur within a severely narrowed evaluative framework.\n\nFrankfurtian defenders reply that if the woman had access to all relevant information and freedom from coercive psychological pressures she would no longer endorse the preference; hence the theory can condemn adaptive preferences as products of manipulation. But the reply smuggles in external, historically sensitive considerations that the pure structural model officially brackets. Once those factors are allowed full weight, we are already moving toward a historical account.\n\n4. Content-Based or Substantive Models  \n\nA more robust route is to deny autonomy to preferences whose content is objectifying, self-degrading or violates basic capabilities. Nussbaum\u2019s capability approach does exactly this: a preference for non-literacy or for foot-binding cannot be autonomous because it denies the agent a threshold of human functioning she is entitled to. Similarly, theories influenced by feminist ethics (e.g. Andrea Westlund\u2019s dialogical autonomy) hold that desires formed within sexist power relations have suspect content\u2014wanting to be obedient to a violent husband is per se problematic.\n\nContent-based accounts elegantly explain why certain adaptive preferences remain non-autonomous even when reflectively endorsed. They also align political theory with the fight against oppression: disqualifying oppressive desires legitimises redistributive and educational interventions.\n\nHowever, they face two objections.\n\nFirst, the objection from disagreement: there is no consensus on what counts as morally objectionable content. Liberals worry that declaring some preferences non-autonomous because they flout \u201cobjective goods\u201d licenses illiberal perfectionism and cultural imperialism. One community might deem a preference for arranged marriage oppressive, another might see it as consonant with communal flourishing.\n\nSecond, the accommodation objection: content-based theories risk false positives. A person may autonomously choose a life of self-sacrifice\u2014for instance a nun\u2019s vow of obedience\u2014where the content looks self-denying by some measures but is nonetheless the product of robust self-authorship. Blanket condemnation of the content would misdescribe her agency. The real problem in paradigm adaptive cases is not simply that the content is objectionable; it is that the preference arose under conditions that precluded informed and imaginative choice.\n\n5. Historical Accounts  \n\nHistorical theories evaluate autonomy by examining the provenance of desires. An agent is non-autonomous with respect to desire d if d is the result of processes that bypass her critical capacities\u2014manipulation, coercion, brainwashing, or more subtle systemic forces such as sexist socialisation. The locus classicus is Robert N. Young\u2019s \u201cAutonomy and the \u2018Inner Citadel\u2019,\u201d refined by Marilyn Friedman, Natalie Stoljar, Marina Oshana and Paul Benson. On these accounts, present-time endorsement is insufficient; a desire is autonomous only if the agent could have challenged and revised it during its formation.\n\nHistorical models handle adaptive preferences well. The village girl\u2019s wish to marry young originates in norms that systematically excluded her from literacy, mobility, and exposure to competing options. The causal history involves constraining social structures, not merely her own reflective endorsement. Therefore her preference is impaired. Historical accounts also explain degrees of autonomy: the more opportunities the agent had to scrutinise and possibly resist a preference, the more autonomous it becomes, even if she ultimately retains it.\n\nYet history-centred theories face two tasks. They must articulate (i) the kind of historical defects that matter, and (ii) how much opportunity to resist is \u201cenough.\u201d Oppression is neither hypnotic brainwashing nor literal coercion, so the theory must capture more diffuse and pervasive mechanisms such as adaptive preferences themselves. Mayo-Wilson and Stark\u2019s critique highlights the danger of infinite regress: every preference is formed in some social context; why do only some contexts defeat autonomy? We need a principled distinction.\n\n6. Toward a Social-Historical Model  \n\nTo meet these challenges we can enrich historical accounts with a relational analysis of power. Start with a baseline: autonomy as self-authorship over time involves at least three capacities: (C1) competence to form and revise a conception of the good, (C2) access to socially available tools\u2014concepts, language, role-models\u2014needed for imagining alternatives, and (C3) an environment that does not illegitimately penalise the exercise of these capacities. An adaptive preference is autonomy-deficient to the extent that the social processes which produced it significantly undermined (C2) and (C3), even if (C1) remains intact.\n\nHow does this work in practice? The girl who \u201cwants\u201d early marriage lacks exposure to counter-narratives of female education; the cost of dissent (ostracism, violence, poverty) is prohibitive. Her critical faculties might be as sharp as anyone\u2019s, but they are deprived of materials and breathing space. Contrast this with an adult who joins a cloister after years of study and worldly experience. The content (obedience, asceticism) overlaps with subordinating roles, yet the historical pathway includes meaningful opportunities to explore other identities, satisfy (C2) and exercise (C3). Her preference can be autonomous even while outwardly similar to non-autonomous ones.\n\nThis model retains the subjectivist insight that what ultimately matters is the agent\u2019s own standpoint: no external authority can impose a life plan. Yet it avoids the Frankfurtian blind spot by embedding the standpoint in social conditions that shape reflection itself. It also accommodates the content-based intuition that some preferences are suspect by showing why they are systematically correlated with oppressive histories, without making moral disapproval the direct criterion of autonomy.\n\n7. Clarifying Objections  \n\na. Is the Social-Historical Model too demanding? Critics might say that few if any of our desires arise under perfect conditions; we are all children of culture. The answer is to treat autonomy as a scalar value. Most ordinary socialisation is compatible with (C2) and (C3): children encounter multiple conceptions of the good through school, media, peers, and grow into adults who can experiment. Oppressive socialisation is distinctive because it aims, intentionally or functionally, to block that experimentation.  \n\nb. Does the model collapse into liberal perfectionism? Not necessarily. The judgment that someone lacks adequate opportunity to grasp alternatives is empirical, not moralistic. We need not declare her present option worthless, only that she did not reasonably have a chance to consider others.\n\nc. What about agents who are aware of alternatives yet still adapt? Some garment workers know of labour rights but discount their value because protesting would risk livelihood. Here the formation of preference still reflects structural penalties; the historical impairment lies in coercive incentives, not ignorance.\n\n8. Comparison with Rival Theories  \n\nSubjectivist structuralism captures the importance of endorsement but fails to explain why wholehearted endorsement in contexts of deprivation rings hollow. Content-based theories capture our moral repugnance but cannot distinguish between autonomous self-sacrifice and heteronomous servility. The Social-Historical Model, by contrast, explains both phenomena: where opportunity for critical uptake of alternatives was crushed, endorsement is suspect; where it was viable, same-content desires may be autonomous.\n\nNotice also that the model secures political guidance. It directs reform not at policing people\u2019s desires but at expanding their real opportunities to test and evaluate them\u2014education, economic independence, legal rights, anti-discrimination policies. If preferences adjust after such expansion, we can treat them as autonomous even if we continue to disagree morally.\n\n9. Relationship to Freedom and Responsibility  \n\nDistinguishing adaptive from autonomous preferences is not merely academic; it affects judgments of responsibility. Suppose a woman refuses potentially life-saving surgery because her community views female bodies as taboo. If the preference is non-autonomous, medical professionals may override it; if autonomous, they ought to respect it. The Social-Historical Model yields nuanced guidance: ask whether she has had genuine chances to consider medical information free of sanction, whether dissenting voices exist, whether she can deliberate without fear. The answer may vary case by case.\n\n10. The Role of Counterfactual Imagination  \n\nA useful diagnostic tool is what Serene Khader calls the Counterfactual Test. Could the agent plausibly sustain the same preference in a nearby world where oppressive constraints are lifted? If yes, the preference may be autonomous; if no, it is probably adaptive. The historical account explains why this counterfactual is relevant: it tracks whether preference formation is robust across changes to unjust background factors.\n\n11. Practical Implications for Development and Feminist Movements  \n\nDevelopment agencies often prioritise preference-satisfaction measures. Recognising autonomy deficits in adaptive preferences justifies interventions aimed at capability expansion even where target populations express satisfaction with status quo. Yet, per the historical model, interventions must be participatory rather than coercive, since autonomy is promoted by widening deliberative horizons, not by imposing values.\n\n12. Conclusion  \n\nWhat undermines the autonomy of adaptive preferences is not solely a mismatch between first- and second-order desires, nor solely the moral dubiousness of desiring oppression. It is the historically oppressive process that narrows the agent\u2019s evaluative field and punishes deviation, thereby disabling the ongoing, future-oriented exercise of self-authorship. Subjectivist and content-based accounts each capture part of the picture, but only a Social-Historical approach integrates those insights while explaining the autonomy deficit in a principled, non-paternalistic way. Therefore, in cases of oppression, autonomy is regained not by policing inner endorsements or outlawing certain contents but by transforming the social conditions that give rise to disadvantage-adapting preferences in the first place.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 0, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 3117, "reasoning_tokens": 128}

Introduction  \n\nWhen Bangladeshi village women declare that they do not want to be educated because \u201ca good wife stays close to the homestead,\u201d or when members of a lower caste in rural India express indifference toward political participation because \u201cpolitics is for our betters,\u201d many philosophers and development economists hesitate to treat those statements as the fully autonomous preferences of free agents. They appear to be \u201cadaptive preferences,\u201d preferences that have been shaped by constraining social, economic, or cultural circumstances. At first sight the women or the lower-caste farmers speak sincerely; yet their preferences seem alienated, defective, or at least not wholly their own. How exactly should we diagnose the autonomy shortfall? Three broad explanatory families dominate the current debate:\n\n1. Subjectivist or internalist models (paradigmatically Harry Frankfurt\u2019s hierarchical account), which analyze autonomy in terms of the agent\u2019s reflective endorsement of her own motivational set.  \n2. Content-based or substantive models, which evaluate autonomy partly by scrutinising what is preferred\u2014e.g., whether the content expresses servility, self-contempt, or other morally objectionable attitudes.  \n3. Historical or procedural-etiological models, which look to the causal history of the preference, asking whether it was induced by manipulation, oppression, or other autonomy-undermining influences.\n\nMy thesis is that, although each approach captures something important, the autonomy deficit characteristic of paradigmatic cases of adaptive preference under oppression is best explained by a broadly historical account. A purely subjectivist model cannot mark a sufficiently sharp boundary between mere adjustment and alienation; a purely content-based model risks perfectionism and discounts the possibility of legitimate life-plans that deviate from liberal expectations. A historical model, suitably refined, illuminates what is objectionable: not the agent\u2019s reflective structure or the substantive content of the preference considered in isolation, but the fact that the preference (i) arose under unjust constraints that excluded relevant alternatives and (ii) would be susceptible to revision under fairer conditions of choice. \n\nI proceed as follows. Section 2 defines adaptive preferences and clarifies the target phenomenon. Section 3 analyses Frankfurt-style subjectivism and its limitations. Section 4 turns to substantive content approaches. Section 5 develops the historical account and shows how it can incorporate the insights of the other two without their liabilities. Section 6 concludes.\n\n2. What Are Adaptive Preferences?  \n\nJon Elster, who introduced the term, drew on Aesop\u2019s fox: unable to reach the grapes, the fox convinces himself they are sour. Adaptive preference formation is the psychological process whereby agents adjust what they want to what they (believe they) can get. Yet not every such adjustment is autonomy-compromising. A mountaineer who, after losing a leg, comes honestly to prefer kayaking over climbing shaped her ends to new constraints in a way many regard as healthy. The cases that trouble us involve injustice: structural gender oppression, racial subordination, caste hierarchies, exploitative labour markets. Agents develop preferences that accommodate the very structures that oppress them\u2014preferences not merely for feasible options, but for options that sustain their deprivation. \n\nThree marks of the worrisome cases:\n\na. They emerge under injustice: the set of feasible options is narrowed because of oppression or deprivation, not by natural or random misfortune alone.  \nb. They display internalisation: the agent\u2019s motivational system endorses the narrow options; there is no overt sense of coercion.  \nc. They exhibit counterfactual instability: were the unjust constraints lifted, many such preferences would wither or radically change.\n\nAny adequate account of the autonomy deficit must explain why (a)\u2013(c) together generate impaired self-government.\n\n3. Subjectivist (Hierarchical) Accounts  \n\n3.1 Frankfurt\u2019s framework  \nFor Frankfurt, an agent is autonomous with respect to a first-order desire (D1) if she identifies with it, i.e. if she has a second-order volition (D2) endorsing D1. What matters is internal endorsement; the genesis of D1 is largely irrelevant. A crack addict lacking any higher-order desire to resist is not autonomous; someone who wholeheartedly wants to continue smoking (and approves of that want) is. \n\n3.2 Application to adaptive preferences  \nOn this view, Bangladeshi women who reflectively endorse the preference to remain uneducated would count as autonomous, provided their second-order volitions align. That outcome offends the intuitive worry about adaptive preferences. The subjectivist can reply in several ways:\n\ni. Claim that oppressed agents do harbour higher-order reservations\u2014suppressed dissatisfaction, \u201csour grapes\u201d they do not fully acknowledge\u2014so endorsement is not wholehearted.  \nii. Strengthen the account by adding further tiers: perhaps autonomy requires identification formed under conditions of adequate information and rational scrutiny (Gerald Dworkin, David Velleman).  \n\nYet both strategies struggle. Empirically, many oppressed people genuinely internalise caste or gender ideology and experience no conscious dissatisfaction. Philosophically, inflating the internalist criteria to approximate ideal rationality or information imports, through the back door, externalist conditions tantamount to the historical constraint we are evaluating. If the test for genuine endorsement requires that the agent\u2019s reflection be insulated from oppressive socialisation, then we have effectively appealed to the causal history after all.\n\n3.3 Deep self vs. social formation  \nSubjectivists rely on the agent\u2019s \u201cdeep self\u201d as the arbiter of autonomy. But when the deep self itself has been shaped by pervasive injustice, appeal to it becomes question-begging. The worry is not that the women\u2019s preference is inconsistent with some deeper stratum of will; the worry is that the will itself has been trained to fit injustice. Hence subjectivism misses the target. It detects autonomy failures arising from internal conflict, but adaptive preferences can be serenely integrated.\n\n4. Content-Based Accounts  \n\n4.1 Substantive theories  \nSome feminists (e.g., Andrea Dworkin) and some liberals (e.g., Joseph Raz) treat autonomy as partly dependent on the value of chosen ends. A preference for enslavement or for self-mutilation is non-autonomous because its content is incompatible with self-respect or human flourishing.\n\n4.2 Diagnosing adaptive preferences  \nA content theorist would say that a woman\u2019s preference for female genital cutting or illiteracy is non-autonomous because these states are intrinsically inimical to her well-being or dignity. Oppression need not enter the story except as a common cause of bad preferences. \n\n4.3 Objections  \ni. Perfectionism and paternalism: Imposing a list of acceptable contents threatens to disrespect pluralism. Not every low-aspiration preference is evidence of oppression; preference for simplicity, asceticism, or traditional roles can be autonomous.  \nii. Misdiagnosis of injustice: The adaptive preference seems autonomy-deficient not merely because it is bad for you but because it was concocted under unfair constraints. Content-analysis overlooks that distinction.  \niii. Cultural imperialism: Labeling certain practices autonomy-destroying qua content courts ethnocentrism. \n\nThus, while content considerations retain moral relevance\u2014they matter to whether the agent is harmed or degraded\u2014they alone cannot explain the peculiar autonomy failure of adaptive preferences.\n\n5. Historical-Procedural Accounts  \n\n5.1 Basic idea  \nAn agent acts autonomously only if her preference was formed through a process sufficiently free from controlling or distorting influences such as coercion, manipulation, indoctrination, or severely restricted option sets. The emphasis is not on current endorsement (subjectivism) nor on content (substantive), but on etiological conditions.\n\n5.2 Historical diagnosis of adaptive preference  \nIn the oppressive cases, the preference was:\n\na. Caused by structural injustice that filtered out attractive alternatives (education, political power).  \nb. Sustained by social norms that punish deviation (ostracism, violence).  \nc. Formed without the agent\u2019s awareness that an alternative life was possible or permissible.\n\nTherefore the agent\u2019s preference is insufficiently her own: it is the product of external power that bypassed her critical faculties or deprived them of material to work on. \n\n5.3 Counterfactual responsiveness constraint  \nHistorically grounded theorists often invoke a counterfactual test: Would the agent still prefer x if she had been exposed to the full range of options under conditions of justice? If the answer is no, the actual preference is autonomy-defective. This respects the agent\u2019s hypothetical evaluative capacities while condemning the injustice that stunted their exercise.\n\n5.4 Advantages over competitors  \n\ni. It explains why content sometimes, but not always, signals an autonomy problem: The same content (e.g., household labor) can be autonomously chosen by a well-educated professional who freely prefers domestic life, yet be non-autonomous for a woman denied schooling. The difference is historical, not substantialist.  \n\nii. It honours internal endorsement without granting it sovereignty: A preference can be wholeheartedly embraced and still be alien because the very mechanisms of endorsement were hijacked in their formation.  \n\niii. It dovetails with political critique: Because the defect traces to oppressive structures, remediation targets social change rather than individual re-education alone.  \n\n5.5 Refinements and challenges  \nA. Degree matters: Few preferences are formed in perfectly just conditions; thus autonomy is scalar. Adaptive preferences occupy the lower end of the scale when injustice is deep and options few.  \nB. Agency amid oppression: Historical accounts must avoid erasing the agency of oppressed persons. Not every preference shaped by injustice is disowned. The key is whether the historical process precluded a minimally adequate opportunity for critical reflection and experiential access to alternatives.  \nC. Information vs. endorsement: Some critics worry that the historical model collapses into an \u201cinformed desire\u201d account. But the distinctive focus is not raw information; it is the structural availability of alternatives and the absence of coercive consequences for choosing them.  \n\n5.6 Hybridising: Incorporating the rival insights  \nAlthough historical conditions are primary, we can incorporate:\n\n\u2022 Subjectivist insight: Current wholehearted endorsement counts in favour of autonomy; lack thereof strengthens the diagnosis.  \n\u2022 Content insight: Some contents\u2014e.g., desire to be a slave\u2014flag likely injustice. They trigger a defeasible presumption of historical contamination.  \n\nThus a nuanced historical approach yields a multi-dimensional assessment:  \n\nAutonomy score = f(endorsement, content warning signals, historical pedigree)  \n\n6. Illustrative Case Comparisons  \n\nCase 1: Maria the Mountain Climber  \nConstraint: Physical disability (non-oppressive misfortune).  \nMaria\u2019s preference for kayaking develops after rehab, with full awareness of alternatives and without social stigma. Historical account says: autonomous, despite adaptation.\n\nCase 2: Shirin the Illiterate Bride  \nConstraint: Patriarchal norms forbid female schooling.  \nShirin sincerely endorses illiteracy, believes education ruins marriageability, and is unaware of alternative gender roles. Historical account says: non-autonomous; endorsement is hijacked, content harmful, and causal history oppressive.\n\nCase 3: Keiko the Voluntary Nun  \nConstraint: None; Keiko from a liberal society freely joins a cloister.  \nAlthough her lifestyle resembles the deprivation of Shirin (obedience, celibacy), the causal path differs\u2014open deliberation, reversible choice. Autonomy affirmed.\n\nContent analysis would mis-diagnose Keiko and Shirin similarly; subjectivism would mis-diagnose Shirin and Keiko similarly; historical analysis discriminates correctly.\n\n7. Objections to the Historical Account  \n\n7.1 Hard cases  \nWhat if an oppressed person had options, knew them, yet freely embraced traditional roles? Historical autonomy might now be partial. The account must allow that some preferences formed under injustice are nonetheless endorsed under comparative awareness. Scalar autonomy captures this.\n\n7.2 Epistemic access  \nHow can we know the counterfactual? Empirical investigation (surveys, experiments, comparative sociology) combined with normative judgment. Uncertainty is inevitable but no greater than in moral assessment generally.\n\n7.3 Romanticising \u201ctrue selves\u201d  \nSome accuse historical theorists of positing a hidden liberal self waiting to be liberated. But the claim is more modest: under non-oppressive conditions, the agent\u2019s preference might change; that possibility, grounded in evidence from migration studies and empowerment programs, suffices to question full autonomy without asserting a predetermined telos.\n\n8. Conclusion  \n\nAdaptive preferences are not automatically signs of defective autonomy. People legitimately adjust aspirations to reality. The autonomy deficit surfaces when the reality is structured by injustice that systematically narrows horizons and shapes desires to fit subordination. Subjectivist models underestimate this because endorsement can itself be colonised. Content-based models overestimate it by condemning all low-ambition desires. Historical accounts, centred on the provenance of preferences and counterfactual responsiveness to a just environment, best capture the phenomenon while accommodating the insights of their rivals.\n\nSeeing adaptive preferences through an historical lens has practical pay-offs: it directs attention toward removing oppressive constraints rather than dismissing the agency of those who live under them. It respects pluralism by allowing that once justice expands the feasible set, some will continue to choose traditional roles; yet if they do so with open eyes, their choice will at last be authentically their own.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 1, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 2929, "reasoning_tokens": 64}
{"question_id": "Koskinen-DefendingRiskAccount-2020", "question": "Several philosophers of science, including Arthur Fine and Heather Douglas, have suggested that the various applicable senses of scientific objectivity (such as procedural objectivity, convergent objectivity, and interactive objectivity) share a common basis in trust\u2014that when we call something objective, we indicate that it can be trusted. However, this characterization seems imprecise. What is the actual relationship between scientific objectivity and trust, and can we provide a more precise account of what unifies the different senses of objectivity?", "answer": "1. Introduction  \n\nThe slogan that \u201cobjectivity is what we can trust\u201d is intuitively attractive.  Scientists, policy-makers, and an interested public all want to know whether data, models, or expert judgments are objective because they want to know whether these things are trustworthy.  Yet the slogan also threatens vacuity.  What precisely is it about an experimental protocol, a convergent measurement, or an open, critical dialogue within a research community that makes any of them worthy of trust?  And do these different \u201csenses of objectivity\u201d really share anything substantial, or are we merely re-using the same honorific?  \n\nMy strategy in what follows is (i) to disambiguate the relevant notions of trust, (ii) to diagnose why objectivity talk migrates so easily into trust talk, and (iii) to offer a more precise unifying account.  I shall argue that what procedural, convergent, and interactive objectivity have in common is not trust simpliciter but a cluster of three jointly sufficient properties\u2014public accountability, substantive independence, and robustness\u2014and that these properties explain why, and in what sense, the deliverances of objective science are trustworthy.  Properly spelled out, this triadic conception retains the social insight of Fine\u2019s and Douglas\u2019s proposal yet avoids reducing objectivity to a mere feeling of confidence.\n\n2. Varieties of objectivity  \n\nPhilosophers now treat objectivity as family-resemblance term.  At least three members of that family are regularly distinguished.\n\na. Procedural objectivity (sometimes \u201cmechanical objectivity\u201d in Daston and Galison\u2019s sense) requires that results be produced by following protocols sufficiently strict that different competent operators would obtain the same outcome.  The paradigm is a standardized chemical assay or an automated data pipeline.\n\nb. Convergent objectivity is a feature of results at which different lines of evidence, different experimental setups, or different research groups independently arrive.  The famous density of the electron, the cosmological constant, and the double-helical structure of DNA are said to be objectively established in this sense.\n\nc. Interactive objectivity (Douglas) is located not in protocols or end-states but in the social processes of criticism, replication, and responsiveness that keep the influence of non-evidential interests in check.  Peer review, adversarial collaboration, and public data repositories exemplify the procedures that constitute an \u201cobjective\u201d research community.\n\n3. Varieties of trust  \n\nTrust likewise admits of multiple readings.\n\na. Interpersonal trust is a rich moral relation involving expectations of good will, vulnerability, and the possibility of betrayal.  I trust my co-author to finish the draft by Friday.\n\nb. Epistemic trust is a thinner attitude in which I treat a source as reliable for some epistemic purpose without necessarily imputing moral intentions to it.  I trust the NIST constants table to within eight significant figures, or I trust the thermometer after calibration.\n\nc. Institutional trust is a disposition to rely on the outputs of a collective practice (e.g., peer-reviewed journals) while bracketing doubts about any individual contributor.  Citizens who get vaccinated on CDC advice display institutional trust.\n\nWhen Fine or Douglas says that \u201cobjective\u201d equals \u201cwhat we can trust,\u201d it is primarily epistemic and institutional trust that is at stake: reliance on a method or community as a dependable deliverer of truth (or something close to it).  Still, these philosophers seldom articulate why the presence of certain procedural or social features licenses rational reliance.  The ensuing gap is exactly what critics find unsatisfying.  We therefore need to excavate the structure that underwrites the inference from \u201cX is objective\u201d to \u201cX may be relied upon.\u201d\n\n4. Why objectivity talk tracks trust talk  \n\nAn historical excursus helps.  In the nineteenth century, Daston argues, \u201cmechanical objectivity\u201d was celebrated precisely because the use of standardized photographic plates or ruled-off data tables promised to remove the idiosyncratic hand of the observer.  By advertising that \u201canyone could get the same result,\u201d scientists answered a social worry: Can we credit these new, unfamiliar facts?  Similarly, when mid-twentieth-century physicists boasted of converging measurements of fundamental constants, they were not merely tracking an epistemic virtue; they were offering a signal to outsiders that the values were no longer hostage to laboratory peculiarities.  Thus, from the start, claims of objectivity have functioned rhetorically to reassure potential users of science.\n\nYet reassurance alone cannot suffice.  An advertiser can also reassure.  What matters is whether the underlying features that trigger the reassurances actually make true belief more likely.  Consequently, a philosophically adequate account must marry the pragmatic dimension of soliciting trust with the epistemic dimension of warranting it.\n\n5. The insufficiency of bare trust  \n\nSome recent analyses risk conflating the warrant with the attitude.  For instance, Fine\u2019s \u201cnatural ontological attitude\u201d (NOA) says, roughly, that objectivity is whatever garners unforced agreement among competent investigators.  But unanimous belief, absent a story about why the belief tends to be true, is compatible with collective delusion.  Douglas improves on Fine by anchoring objectivity in institutional mechanisms (transparency, criticism, uptake), yet she leaves open how exactly these mechanisms secure reliability; trusting them might remain free-floating.\n\nHence the task: identify the features common to all \u201cobjective\u201d senses that (a) rationally justify epistemic trust and (b) explain why the adjective legitimately applies to protocols, results, and social interactions alike.\n\n6. Three unifying properties  \n\nI propose that the real commonalities are the following:\n\n1. Public accountability: The processes that produce the purportedly objective outcomes are open to inspection, replication, or challenge by qualified others.  Accountability matters because it deters careless or biased conduct and provides a path for error-correction.\n\n2. Substantive independence: The processes are designed so that contingent, idiosyncratic, or interest-laden factors are screened off from the final result, either by automation (procedural), by independent lines of evidence (convergent), or by structured uptake of criticism (interactive).  Independence matters because it blocks systematic distortions tied to particular persons, institutions, or worldviews.\n\n3. Robustness: The results are stable across relevant variations\u2014of method, context, or perspective.  A measurement that survives calibration changes or a theory supported by several mutually cross-checking data streams exemplifies robustness.  Robustness matters because error sources rare enough not to infect every pathway are unlikely to survive such cross-checks.\n\nWhy think these three properties are jointly sufficient for warranted trust?  Public accountability makes hidden manipulation costly; substantive independence prevents any one distorting factor from dictating the outcome; robustness ensures that accidental residual influences do not accumulate unchecked.  Together they make it objectively probable\u2014though not infallible\u2014that the result reflects the world rather than the quirks of the knowers.  The upshot is reliability, and therefore rational epistemic trust.\n\n7. Mapping the three properties onto the standard senses  \n\nConsider procedural objectivity.  A double-blind randomized clinical trial is publicly accountable (methods must be registered, raw data can be audited).  It achieves substantive independence by random allocation and blinding, which sever causal links between researchers\u2019 hopes and outcome measures.  It aims at robustness through pre-specification of endpoints, intention-to-treat analysis, and replication in multiple centers.\n\nConvergent objectivity fits the triad as well.  Convergence is rarely declared after just two agreeing measurements; scientists look for independent pathways whose shared intersection is resilient under perturbation.  Astronomers, for example, estimate the Hubble constant using cosmic microwave background data, supernovae, and baryon acoustic oscillations.  Each line is publicly accountable (data archives, shared analysis codes), substantively independent (distinct instruments, calibration procedures, astrophysical systematics), and jointly robust (agreement across very different error structures).  Trust is earned when convergence cannot be explained except by a common causal signal from the world.\n\nInteractive objectivity, finally, codifies the community-level counterpart of the same trio.  Peer review and post-publication criticism supply accountability; editorial diversity and adversarial collaborations secure independence of viewpoint; iterative cycles of replication and meta-analysis deliver robustness.  Once again, when the three conditions are met, dependence on any one actor\u2019s biases becomes vanishingly unlikely, and users may rationally rely.\n\n8. Advantages over the bare trust account  \n\n1. Precision: The triadic account identifies concrete, operationalizable criteria, avoiding the vagueness of \u201ctrust-worthy.\u201d  A lab can ask whether its pipeline is transparent (accountability), whether biases are blocked (independence), and whether results remain stable across techniques (robustness).\n\n2. Diagnostic power: Cases in which objectivity is contested often reveal the breakdown of one of the three properties.  The early 2000s controversy over arsenic in rice lacked public accountability (data not shared) even though methods were standardized; hence trust faltered.  Climate science denialism, conversely, attacks public accountability and robustness, prompting scientists to bolster both through open data and multimodel ensembles.\n\n3. Scope: Because the three properties abstract from particular material realizations, they cover laboratory automation, meta-analytic convergence, and community norms without remainder.  Thus the senses are unified non-trivially.\n\n9. Objections and replies  \n\nObjection 1: The account is circular; how do we know that robustness, independence, and accountability themselves enhance truth-conduciveness?  \n\nReply: We assess them by their error-rate reducing mechanisms.  Accountability lowers Type-S errors (selective reporting) by increasing detection probability.  Independence blocks confounding by isolating causal influence.  Robustness is a statistical surrogate for low model misspecification: if a parameter estimate stays within \u03b5 across K independent variations, the chance that the real value lies outside \u03b5 shrinks roughly with 1/K under broad conditions.  These are empirical, not merely definitional, claims.\n\nObjection 2: Some sciences\u2014e.g., parts of theoretical physics or paleontology\u2014cannot meet the public accountability criterion in a strong sense.  Are they thereby nonobjective?  \n\nReply: Accountability is scalar.  Even in high-energy theory, derivations can be scrutinized, code shared, and assumptions declared.  Where replication by direct experiment is impossible, the community compensates by redoubling transparency and ensuring that multiple, rival explanatory pathways produce the same empirical consequences (robustness and independence again).  Degrees of objectivity therefore vary but do not collapse.\n\nObjection 3: Values and interests sometimes legitimately shape research agendas (Douglas\u2019s own value\u2010ladenness thesis).  Doesn\u2019t the \u201cindependence\u201d requirement illegitimately expunge these influences?  \n\nReply: Independence targets non-epistemic values in the evidential link, not in the context of discovery or choice of problem.  Deciding to study climate change because one cares about mitigation is fine; letting that concern skew data analysis is not.  Thus the account respects Douglas\u2019s distinction between direct and indirect value roles.\n\n10. Consequences for scientific practice and policy  \n\nIf the triadic analysis is correct, calls for objectivity in policy advice should be translated into demands for institutions that secure accountability, independence, and robustness.  For instance:\n\n\u2022 Regulatory toxicology can move from industry-sponsored single studies (low independence) to multisite, preregistered consortia (high independence and accountability).  \n\n\u2022 Journals can adopt open peer review, registered reports, and mandatory data deposition to strengthen all three properties simultaneously.  \n\n\u2022 Public communication should educate citizens not just to \u201ctrust science\u201d but to look for the specific marks of objective warrant\u2014Has the claim survived scrutiny? Are diverse lines of evidence aligned? Are the data open?  Trust becomes conditional and intelligent rather than blind.\n\n11. Comparison with alternative unifiers  \n\nHelen Longino\u2019s \u201ccritical contextual empiricism\u201d also foregrounds community criticism, but her four norms (tempered equality of intellectual authority, uptake of criticism, public standards, and tempered equality of intellectual authority) map neatly onto just two of our properties (accountability and independence).  Robustness is left implicit; indeed Longino concedes that a community could satisfy her norms yet reach faulty consensus if alternative methods are unavailable.  The triadic account fills that gap.\n\nSchematically, the three properties synthesize insights scattered across other views: Daston and Galison\u2019s mechanical objectivity highlights independence; Wimsatt\u2019s robustness analyses supply robustness; Habermasian discourse ethics emphasizes accountability.  Unification was hidden because no one noticed that all three must operate together to ground trust.\n\n12. Conclusion  \n\nFine and Douglas are right that objectivity is intimately connected with trust, but \u201cobjectivity = being trusted\u201d is at best a promissory note.  A result is trusted because, and to the extent that, it is produced by processes that are publicly accountable, substantively independent of distorting influences, and robust across relevant variations.  These three properties jointly explain why procedural, convergent, and interactive objectivity belong to the same conceptual family.  They also provide concrete guidance for strengthening objectivity wherever science informs high-stakes decisions.  The unification is therefore not merely philosophical housekeeping; it is a blueprint for cultivating rational, well-placed trust in the sciences upon which our societies increasingly depend.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 0, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 2933, "reasoning_tokens": 128}
{"question_id": "Koskinen-DefendingRiskAccount-2020", "question": "Several philosophers of science, including Arthur Fine and Heather Douglas, have suggested that the various applicable senses of scientific objectivity (such as procedural objectivity, convergent objectivity, and interactive objectivity) share a common basis in trust\u2014that when we call something objective, we indicate that it can be trusted. However, this characterization seems imprecise. What is the actual relationship between scientific objectivity and trust, and can we provide a more precise account of what unifies the different senses of objectivity?", "answer": "1. Introduction  \n\nWhen scientists say that a result is \u201cobjective,\u201d the term typically functions as a ringing seal of approval: accept this claim, it can be relied on. Arthur Fine (1998) captures the sentiment in a slogan: \u201cobjectivity is just what we\u2014as a community\u2014can trust.\u201d Heather Douglas (2004) echoes the idea, emphasizing that objectivity matters chiefly because it allows lay publics, policymakers, and scientists themselves to trust the outputs of scientific work. Yet the identification of objectivity with trust threatens to be merely promissory. It risks collapsing two distinct normative notions\u2014objectivity and trust\u2014into a single, unanalyzed reassurance. A closer look at the varieties of objectivity that philosophers and historians of science distinguish\u2014procedural, measurement, convergent, interactive, ontic, perspectival, and so on\u2014shows that calling them all \u201cways of being trustworthy\u201d does little explanatory work unless we can say (i) just what kind of trust is involved, (ii) by whom and under what conditions it is warranted, and (iii) how the disparate senses hang together.   \n\nMy aim is to disentangle and then reconnect the two ideas. First, I briefly explicate the main families of scientific objectivity. Second, I analyze the concept of trust, emphasizing its epistemic and social dimensions. Third, I show that objectivity and trust stand to one another not as synonyms but as ground and superstructure: objectivity, properly understood, is a cluster of bias\u2010blocking and perspective\u2010neutralizing strategies whose success licenses a distinctive, rational form of epistemic trust. Finally, I propose a unifying account: the many senses of objectivity converge on a single abstract property\u2014resilient perspective\u2010invariance produced by public, rule\u2010governed epistemic practices. Because this property renders dependence on idiosyncratic factors negligible, it furnishes warranted grounds for the trust that Fine and Douglas rightly highlight. In short, objectivity is what makes certain doxastic and practical trusts rational; trust is the upshot, not the essence, of objectivity.\n\n2. The Varieties of Scientific Objectivity  \n\nHistorians Lorraine Daston and Peter Galison famously trace three successive \u201cvirtues\u201d of objectivity\u2014truth\u2010to\u2010nature, mechanical objectivity, and trained judgment\u2014each corresponding to distinct ideals of how to rid scientific representation of subjective contamination. Philosophers have further multiplied the categories; for present purposes four families suffice.  \n\na. Procedural objectivity. Reproducible experiments, standardized measurement protocols, double\u2010blind trials, and statistical decision rules promise to deliver results independent of the quirks of individual experimenters. The reliability of the product is outsourced to a publicly accessible procedure.  \n\nb. Measurement (or rule\u2010following) objectivity. Instruments\u2014photographic plates, cloud chambers, scanning electron microscopes\u2014are employed and calibrated so that reporting requires minimal interpretative discretion. Mechanical traces stand in for fallible perceptions, again limiting the role of personal judgment.  \n\nc. Convergent (or robustness) objectivity. A claim is buttressed when multiple independent lines of evidence\u2014different instruments, modeling techniques, or disciplinary approaches\u2014\u201cconverge\u201d on the same conclusion. Eliminating shared sources of error underwrites greater confidence.  \n\nd. Interactive (or social) objectivity. Peer review, adversarial collaboration, replication studies, and critical discourse embody the ideal that only by subjecting hypotheses to the scrutiny of a diverse, sometimes hostile, community can we wash out bias that any single perspective might introduce.  \n\nThese ideals do not reduce to one another, but neither are they unrelated. Each lessens the evidential weight borne by individual idiosyncrasies, whether cognitive (expectation effects), material (instrumental drift), or social (value\u2010laden interests). Each is therefore plausibly labeled a kind of objectivity.  \n\n3. Trust: A Brief Analysis  \n\n\u201cTrust\u201d is itself a polysemous term. Philosophers such as Annette Baier, Karen Jones, Russell Hardin, and Niklas Luhmann distinguish at least the following elements:  \n\n\u2022 Dependency: the truster must rely on the trusted for some valued good (information, action, safety).  \n\u2022 Vulnerability: reliance exposes the truster to potential betrayal or error.  \n\u2022 Positive expectation: the truster expects competence and goodwill (or at least non\u2010malice) on the part of the trusted.  \n\u2022 Normative governance: trust generates legitimate criticism if the expectations it grounds are willfully thwarted.  \n\nEpistemic trust arises when the valued good is true belief or reliable information. Hardwig (1985) points out that modern science is shot through with such trust: no physicist personally verifies every theorem, no clinician checks every step of a vaccine trial. Instead, they justifiably rely on the word, data, and integrity of a sprawling community of experts.  \n\nTrust, then, is not the same as mere reliability. Thermometers are reliable; but most writers reserve \u201ctrust\u201d for relations among agents, or at least among institutions capable of norms. Nor is trust the same as blind faith. Trust can be, and often is, rational\u2014grounded in reasons, evidence, and track records. It follows that if objectivity is to be linked with trust, the linkage must specify how varieties of objectivity generate reasons that render dependence on the outputs of science rationally permissible, even obligatory.  \n\n4. Objectivity as the Ground of Warranted Epistemic Trust  \n\nIf we survey the four families of objectivity sketched above, a pattern emerges. Each is designed to minimize the influence of any single individual\u2019s perspective on the final knowledge claim. Procedural rules, mechanical traces, converging evidence, and critical interaction all operate by canceling, neutralizing, or averaging out idiosyncratic factors. The result is an epistemic product whose pedigree does not depend heavily on who happened to carry out the experiment or formulate the model. Because personal contingencies have been systematically screened off, so have salient modes of epistemic vulnerability. I can rationally take a standardized lab result at face value without evaluating the psychologist\u2019s character; I can cite a convergently supported climate model without inspecting every data set; I can ingest a pharmaceutical certified by double\u2010blind trials without interviewing each member of the FDA panel.  \n\nGeneralizing:  \n\nObjectivity (minimal): A knowledge claim is objective to the extent that its credibility is resilient under substitution of epistemic subjects and under a relevant class of perspective shifts.  \n\nTrustworthiness (epistemic): An agent or institution is trustworthy with respect to proposition p for audience A if A\u2019s dependence on that agent or institution to form true belief about p is rationally justified given the available evidence.  \n\nThe relationship is straightforward. Because objectivity delivers resilience under perspective shift, it removes much of the personal vulnerability that typically makes trust risky. Where such resilience is demonstrably achieved, the evidential burden needed to license trust is correspondingly reduced. A rational agent can therefore adopt an attitude of trust toward objective claims with less epistemic overhead.  \n\nNotice that the order of explanation runs from objectivity to trust, not vice versa. Trust does not explain objectivity; rather, objectivity makes trust reasonable. This is why Fine\u2019s slogan\u2014\u201cobjectivity means we can trust it\u201d\u2014captures an important pragmatic upshot while missing the deeper structure. It is like saying of a bank\u2019s solvency regulations, \u201cthey let customers sleep at night.\u201d True but superficial; the regulations, not the sleep, constitute the solidity.  \n\n5. Unifying the Senses: Perspective\u2010Invariance via Publicly Shared Controls  \n\nPhilosophers often despair of unifying the senses of objectivity, proposing instead a \u201cfamily resemblance\u201d view. I think we can do better. Let us define:\n\nResilient Perspective\u2010Invariance (RPI): A process or product exhibits RPI if and only if (i) its epistemic output is invariant under a set of transformations that map one perspective (individual, methodological, conceptual, or social) onto another, and (ii) the invariance is produced and certified by publicly accessible controls that variously constrain, standardize, or diversify the perspectives involved.\n\nClause (i) abstracts the common aim: make the result independent of whose perspective is employed. Clause (ii) ensures that the independence is not merely accidental but achieved through recognizable, repeatable, community\u2010governed practices.\n\nNow check the four families.\n\n\u2022 Procedural objectivity secures invariance via standardized laboratory protocols (transformation: substitution of experimenters).  \n\u2022 Measurement objectivity secures invariance via mechanical inscription (transformation: substitution of observers\u2019 sensory apparatus).  \n\u2022 Convergent objectivity secures invariance across evidential pathways (transformation: substitution of empirical lines).  \n\u2022 Interactive objectivity secures invariance via social criticism (transformation: substitution of evaluative perspectives).\n\nAll realize RPI. Each family simply emphasizes a different transformation group, a different dimension along which bias might leak in. On this account, \u201cobjective\u201d is not a thick evaluative label for \u201ctrustworthy\u201d but a technical descriptor: the product withstands a publicly regimented battery of perspective\u2010switches.  \n\n6. Objections and Replies  \n\nObjection 1: Some scientific conclusions are trusted even when they do not obviously exhibit perspective\u2010invariance\u2014consider frontier string theory. Does our account imply that such trust is irrational?  \n\nReply: Frontier theories typically enjoy derivative trust, grounded in the proven trustworthiness of the institutional network that vouches for them, not in direct evidence of RPI. Our account predicts precisely this two\u2010tier structure: when direct objectivity is unavailable, we trust the trustworthy, i.e., the organizations that have historically delivered RPI where it is testable.\n\nObjection 2: Social values shape problem choice and data interpretation; hence no genuine perspective\u2010invariance is achievable.  \n\nReply: RPI is not an absolute elimination of all perspective. It is resilient relative to a specified class of transformations. Objectivity is thus a matter of degree and domain. A climate model may be objective with respect to the physics of radiative forcing while remaining value\u2010laden in decisions about which policy\u2010relevant variables to highlight. Recognizing the contextual character of the transformation class preserves the critical insights of feminist and post\u2010Kuhnian science studies without abandoning the regulative ideal of objectivity.\n\nObjection 3: Why privilege perspective\u2010invariance rather than, say, empirical adequacy, predictive success, or explanatory power as the unifying feature?\n\nReply: All are important epistemic virtues, but only perspective\u2010invariance captures what is distinctive about objectivity as opposed to, for instance, empirical adequacy. A horoscope can be empirically adequate relative to loose observational criteria, yet its credibility remains hostage to the belief system of its astrologer. Objectivity\u2019s raison d\u2019\u00eatre is to decouple epistemic warrant from parochial vantage points. RPI articulates that decoupling.\n\n7. Implications for Scientific Practice and Public Policy  \n\nPrecisifying the tie between objectivity and trust has downstream payoffs.\n\nFirst, it clarifies debates over reproducibility. When psychologists worry about \u201cthe replication crisis,\u201d they are complaining that the RPI of procedural objectivity\u2014specifically invariance under experimenter substitution\u2014was spuriously assumed. Fixing the crisis demands either establishing genuine invariance (better statistics, pre\u2010registration) or restricting the scope of trust appropriately.\n\nSecond, it illuminates science communication. Public trust in climate science, vaccine safety, or evolutionary biology falters when nonexperts do not perceive the mechanisms that confer RPI. Rather than repeating the mantra \u201ctrust the science,\u201d communicators should render visible the specific procedures\u2014inter\u2010laboratory replications, convergent evidence, adversarial review\u2014that warrant trust.\n\nThird, the account guides responsible methodological pluralism. Because convergence across diverse perspectives increases RPI, funding agencies and journals ought to encourage heterogeneity in methods, models, and cultural standpoints. Diversity is not mere social virtue signaling; it is an epistemic strategy for maximizing objectivity.\n\n8. Conclusion  \n\nScientific objectivity and epistemic trust are intimately linked, but the link is not definitional. Objectivity is not simply the fact that we do (or should) trust certain results. Rather, objectivity consists in resilient perspective\u2010invariance engineered by publicly regulated procedures that cancel, average, or compensate for the idiosyncrasies of individual knowers and instruments. When, and because, a claim exhibits that property, reliance on it becomes rationally warranted\u2014hence trust is appropriate. Viewed this way, the multiple species of objectivity turn out to be genus\u2010 and\u2010species realizations of a single aim: to fashion knowledge that is not the hostage of particular persons, places, or passions. Trust, in turn, is the rational attitude we are entitled to adopt toward such knowledge.
