Provide arguments for your answer.", "answer": "What should you believe about your own coin once you are told that, out of a countably infinite collection of fair and independent tosses, only finitely many have come up heads?  The problem looks disarmingly simple\u2014surely, one is tempted to reply, the coin in your hand is still fair, so nothing you learn about the other coins should make any difference.  On closer inspection, however, the case turns out to sit at the intersection of two difficult topics in probability theory and epistemology:\n\n1.  Updating on an event of probability 0.  \n2.  The tension between \u201clocal\u201d independence (each coin is individually fair) and \u201cglobal\u201d structural information about an infinite totality.\n\nOnce those complications are made explicit, it becomes apparent that no single answer is forced on us by ordinary Bayesian principles.  Two answers\u2014in fact, two broad families of answers\u2014are defensible.  One family keeps the credence at \u00bd; the other drives it to 0.  The right moral, I shall argue, is not that one of these answers is simply wrong, but that the problem exposes an incompleteness in orthodox Bayesian conditionalisation whenever we are asked to condition on an event to which the prior gives probability 0.  In such cases we need some further principle\u2014mathematical or epistemic\u2014to supplement the bare Bayesian machinery.\n\nI.  Why ordinary conditionalisation breaks down\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nBayes\u2019 rule tells us that  \n\n\tP(H | E) = P(H \u2227 E) / P(E),\n\nbut only when P(E) > 0.  In our set-up, the probability that *finitely* many heads occur in an *infinite* sequence of fair tosses is 0.  Indeed, for any fixed natural number n, the probability that there are at most n heads is already 0, and \u201cfinitely many\u201d is the union of those countably many probability-0 events.  The very evidence we learn therefore has prior probability 0\u2014exactly the situation in which Bayes\u2019 rule is silent.\n\nKolmogorov\u2019s theory can be extended: for each \u03c3-algebra one can build *regular conditional probabilities* that assign a conditional distribution even at probability-0 events.  But those extensions are *non-unique.*  One may impose additional constraints\u2014continuity, symmetry, shift-invariance, causal constraints, pragmatic desiderata\u2014and each such constraint can pick out a different regular conditional measure.  What our case reveals is that ordinary Bayesianism plus background mathematical facts underdetermines what the posterior *ought* to be.  Two natural additional principles point in opposite directions.\n\nII.  The \u00bd answer: respect local independence\n---------------------------------------------\n\nA.  The intuitive argument  \n\n\u201cOnly finitely many heads\u201d is a global fact about the entire sequence.  But my coin is supposed to be locally independent of every *tail event* that concerns only the other coins.  Because which side my single coin shows makes essentially no difference to whether only finitely many heads are obtained\u2014there are already countably many other coins whose behaviour can override that one bit of information\u2014it is tempting to say that my coin remains epistemically screened off by the independence built into the original set-up.  Hence the natural conclusion: my credence stays at \u00bd.\n\nB.  Formal reconstruction  \n\nOne way to make this precise is via *finite-information* updates.  Suppose instead of learning the exact event \u201conly finitely many heads,\u201d you learned the family of ever stronger finite approximations:\n\nE\u2081:  \u201cAt most 1 head turned up among coins 2,3,4, \u2026\u201d  \nE\u2082:  \u201cAt most 2 heads turned up among coins 2,3,4, \u2026\u201d  \n\u22ef\n\nFor each finite E\u2099 the probability is positive, and ordinary Bayes works.  Because my coin\u2019s outcome is independent of the outcomes of coins 2,3,4,\u2026, one finds  \n\n\tP(X\u2081 = H | E\u2099) = \u00bd   for every n.\n\nIf one then takes the *martingale limit* (letting n \u2192 \u221e to obtain the limiting \u03c3-algebra that corresponds to the tail event \u201cfinitely many heads\u201d), the conditional probability remains \u00bd.  On this construction the information that makes E true is carried wholly by the *other* coins, and by design it never correlates with my own toss.\n\nC.  Philosophical considerations  \n\n1.  The Lewis\u2013Elga *Principal Principle* connects objective chance with rational credence: if you are certain that the chance of a proposition is p and you have no inadmissible information, your credence should be p.  Here you *do* acquire information, but arguably it is not *inadmissible* with respect to your own coin\u2014it does not convey any causal or statistical news about that particular toss.  \n2.  More generally, the \u00bd answer respects a familiar injunction: do not let \u201cbarely relevant\u201d global facts overwrite *local* physical chanciness.  Even after you learn a wildly improbable cosmic coincidence, that coincidence (absent further detail) usually gives you no reason at all to doubt the fairness of an isolated coin flip you yourself performed.\n\nIII.  The 0 answer: typicality in an infinite population\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nA very different line of thought begins with an obvious numerical asymmetry: in a countably infinite crowd with only finitely many heads, almost *everyone* is a tail-flipper.  Heads, by stipulation, are *rare exceptions.*  Unless you have privileged information about your own index in that crowd\u2014even an infinity of information!\u2014you should think it overwhelmingly likely that you belong to the majority class, viz. the tails.\n\nA.  The random-index argument  \n\nImagine that *who you are* among the countable crowd is determined by a process independent of the coin flipping\u2014say, a lottery that assigns persons to natural numbers.  Conditional on \u201c\ufb01nitely many heads,\u201d the probability that a randomly chosen index happens to be one of the exceptional finitely many heads is zero.  By a standard principle of indifference (one\u2019s own position is not special), your credence should therefore collapse to 0.\n\nB.  Regular conditional probabilities that implement the 0 answer  \n\nOne can formalise the \u201crandom index\u201d idea by building a *shift-invariant* regular conditional probability.  The shift operator \u03c3 shifts every sequence one place to the left.  The event \u201conly finitely many heads\u201d is *shift invariant* (\u03c3E = E).  By a theorem of Blackwell and Dubins, the only shift-invariant conditional on E is the one that assigns probability 0 to any cylinder in which a designated coordinate is heads.  Intuitively: once E is granted, no particular index can \u201csoak up\u201d a positive fraction of the remaining finite quota of heads.\n\nC.  Philosophical considerations  \n\n1.  The *typicality* principle.  In an infinite population, knowing that only finitely many members have property P makes it (almost) certain you lack P, unless you possess additional index-locating or causal information that associates *you* with those exceptions.  \n2.  Connections to self-locating belief.  The update from \u00bd to 0 mirrors familiar reasoning in the Sleeping Beauty literature: if Beauty were told on Sunday that only finitely many awakenings in an unending process involve a red room, it seems right for her to set her credence very near 0 that *this* awakening is in the red room.  \n3.  A pragmatic angle.  Suppose an angel offers you a bet that pays \\$1 if your coin is heads and costs \\$0.60 to enter.  Before learning E you would decline (expected value \\$0.50).  After learning E, the bet has effectively negative expected value if you adopt the 0 posterior.  Only the 0 answer conforms to the manifest structure of gains and losses in an infinite population in which winners are provably rare.\n\nIV.  Why the two procedures diverge\n------------------------------------\n\nIf ordinary conditionalisation does not fix P(X\u2081 = H | E), the natural next question is whether any plausible higher-order principle forces one of the two answers.  Unfortunately, no principle generally accepted among Bayesians does the job.  Instead, the two answers reflect two *different* ways of treating information that is both global and measure-zero:\n\n\u2022  Local independence reasoning keeps one coordinate\u2019s chance insulated from facts about the rest, implementing what probabilists call *coordinate-wise* or *product-\u03c3-algebra* conditioning.  \n\u2022  Typicality reasoning treats an agent\u2019s own coordinate as *epistemically exchangeable* with all the rest, demanding that conditioning be *shift invariant.*\n\nThese treatments pick out different regular conditional probabilities, both mathematically legitimate.  There is no purely probabilistic fact of the matter about which is \u201cthe\u201d conditional distribution at E.  Additional structural or epistemic assumptions settle the issue, and those assumptions are precisely what philosophers dispute.\n\nV.  Can rationality itself decide?\n----------------------------------\n\nThree main proposals have been floated in the literature.\n\n1.  **Causal admissibility.**  Joyce and others urge that only *causally relevant* evidence should alter credence in a chance event.  Because my coin is causally independent of the infinitely many others, the \u00bd answer follows.  \n   \u2022  Objection: the independence is *statistical*, not causal, and statistical independence can break down under conditioning\u2014even when causal independence holds.\n\n2.  **Self-locating neutrality.**  Elga and Bostrom argue that when agents lack special indexical information, they should reason as \u201crandom samples\u201d from their reference class.  That principle forces the 0 answer.  \n   \u2022  Objection: in many ordinary circumstances (finite crowds), we *do not* adjust our belief to 0 upon learning there are only finitely many exceptional individuals.  So why should we do so merely because the crowd is infinite?\n\n3.  **Regularity/continuity.**  Some authors (e.g., van Fraassen) recommend taking limits through positive-probability events that approximate the evidence.  Different choices of approximating sequence lead to different limits; without a unique topology of approximation the rule is silent.\n\nIn short, nothing like a universal Bayesian norm settles the dispute.  Rationality underdetermines the right posterior; the choice is to be made by deeper principles about what counts as genuinely *inadmissible* information, or about how self-locating beliefs should interact with objective chance.\n\nVI.  A qualified verdict\n------------------------\n\nWhere does that leave us?  Two lessons emerge.\n\nLesson 1: absent further structure, your posterior is *not uniquely determined.*  Saying \u201cI obey the laws of probability\u201d is not enough; one must choose a scheme for extending conditionalisation to probability-0 evidence.\n\nLesson 2: once extra structure is supplied, each scheme is coherent.  \n\u2022  If you take yourself as having index-locating knowledge that is *independent* of which coins are heads, you remain at \u00bd.  \n\u2022  If you instead regard your own index as \u201crandom\u201d among the crowd, you should move to 0.\n\nWhich stance is more philosophically appealing depends on background commitments.  I myself favour the 0 answer, because I accept a form of the *Self-Sampling Assumption*: absent index-locating evidence, treat yourself as a random sample from the reference class relevant to the evidence just acquired.  But I cannot claim that this is forced upon every rational agent; those who privilege local independence over self-locating typicality can, with equal mathematical legitimacy, retain the \u00bd credence.\n\nVII.  Summing up\n----------------\n\n1.  Standard Bayesian conditionalisation does not apply, because the evidence has prior probability 0.  \n2.  Two quite natural extensions of Bayesianism suggest two different posteriors:  \n   a.  The *local-independence* extension leaves the credence at \u00bd.  \n   b.  The *shift-invariant/typicality* extension drives the credence to 0.  \n3.  Nothing in classical probability theory or mainstream Bayesian epistemology uniquely mandates one extension over the other.  \n4.  Philosophical principles about causality, admissibility, and self-locating belief *do* bear on the choice, but those principles are themselves contested.  \n\nTherefore the only honest answer a philosopher can give is conditional:\n\n\u2022  If you treat yourself as a *randomly located* member of the infinite crowd, your credence should fall to 0.  \n\u2022  If you insist that your epistemic situation is exhausted by the intrinsic properties of your own coin plus independent background physics, you may rationally keep your credence at \u00bd.\n\nEither way, the case is a striking reminder that probability theory, by itself, does not always dictate how an ideally rational agent should update on measure-zero information.  To finish the job, we must bring in further philosophical commitments\u2014about causation, about indexicality, and about what it means to be a \u201ctypical\u201d observer in an infinite universe.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 0, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 5039, "reasoning_tokens": 2240}

The scenario and the puzzle  \n\nInfinitely many agents\u2014call them \ud835\udc5d\u2080, \ud835\udc5d\u2081, \ud835\udc5d\u2082, \u2026\u2014simultaneously toss fair, mutually independent coins.  Afterwards they are told the following:\n\n\u2003(F)  Only finitely many of the coins landed heads.\n\nWhat credence should a particular agent\u2014say \ud835\udc5d\u2080\u2014now attach to the proposition  \n\n\u2003(H\u2080)  \ud835\udc5d\u2080\u2019s own coin landed heads ?\n\nUnconditionally the answer is trivially \u00bd; that is what \u201cfair coin\u201d means.  But the information (F) is behaviourally extraordinary: under the ordinary probability measure the probability of finitely many heads in an \u03c9-sequence of i.i.d. Bernoulli(\u00bd) trials is zero.  We must therefore decide what Bayesian conditionalisation\u2014or more broadly, rational belief revision\u2014requires when we learn an event of measure 0.\n\nThere are two temptations.\n\n\u2022  Independence Temptation:  (F) does not mention any particular coin; heads or tails for \ud835\udc5d\u2080 is still causally and stochastically independent of what the other agents happen to have flipped.  So the credence in (H\u2080) ought to remain \u00bd.\n\n\u2022  Scarcity Temptation:  If only finitely many heads occurred among countably many trials, heads have become a vanishingly rare property.  Given sheer cardinal arithmetic, the fraction of agents with heads is 0, so the chance that *I* am one of the lucky few should be 0\u2014so my credence in (H\u2080) should drop to 0.\n\nBoth temptations look principled; whichever answer we choose must emerge from a careful treatment of conditional probability for measure-zero events, together with symmetry considerations.  The rest of this essay builds the case that the scarcity instinct is correct: rational credence in (H\u2080) should be driven all the way to 0.  That conclusion is surprising, and it forces us to clarify what \u201cindependence\u201d and \u201cfairness\u201d really secure for us once we are told that something probabilistically impossible has occurred.\n\n2.  The probabilistic background  \n\nLet (\u03a9, \u2131, P) be the usual probability space for an \u03c9-sequence (X\u2080, X\u2081, \u2026) of independent Bernoulli(\u00bd) variables, where X\u1d62 = 1 represents heads.  Write  \n\n\u2003S = \u2211_{i=0}^{\u221e} X\u1d62,\n\nand let  \n\n\u2003F = {\u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9 : S(\u03c9) is finite}.\n\nThe strong law of large numbers or the second Borel-Cantelli lemma implies P(F) = 0.  Yet our evidence says F has indeed obtained.\n\nOrdinary Bayesian conditionalisation uses the ratio formula\n\n\u2003P(A | B) = P(A\u2227B) / P(B),\n\nwhich is undefined when P(B) = 0.  A standard remedy is a *regular conditional probability* (rcp): a measurable function Q such that for all measurable B, Q(\u00b7,B) is a version of P(B | \u00b7).  On nice spaces rcp\u2019s always exist, but they are unique only up to P-null sets; accordingly, conditioning on a null event is never uniquely determined by the Kolmogorov axioms alone.  Additional structure\u2014symmetry, limiting procedures, or pragmatic stipulations\u2014must do the remaining work.\n\n3.  A symmetry-based regular conditional probability  \n\nThe infinite coin-tossing experiment is *exchangeable*: finite permutations of the indices leave the joint distribution invariant.  Any admissible conditional probability should respect that same symmetry unless the conditioning event itself breaks it.  Crucially, F does not pick out any participant; it simply says that the set of heads-makers is finite.  Hence\n\n\u2003(Exchangeability)\u2003For any i, j \u2208 \u2115,\u2003P(X\u1d62 = 1 | F) = P(X\u2c7c = 1 | F).\n\nCall this common value p.  We now compute the expected number of heads conditional on F:\n\n\u2003E(S | F) = E(\u2211_{i} X\u1d62 | F)  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003= \u2211_{i=0}^{\u221e} P(X\u1d62 = 1 | F)   [Countable additivity + linearity of expectation]  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003= \u2211_{i=0}^{\u221e} p.\n\nNow S is finite on F, so E(S | F) must itself be finite.  But the right-hand side diverges whenever p > 0, and equals 0 when p = 0.  Therefore p = 0 is forced by ordinary measure-theoretic principles (plus the mild assumption that E(S | F) is finite\u2014hardly controversial if S itself is finite).  Exchangeability plus countable additivity thus *pin down* a unique rcp that sends P(X\u2080 = 1 | F) to 0.\n\nIndependence does *not* survive conditioning.  The intuitive reason is simple: the fact that S is finite imposes a severe global constraint, correlating each toss with every other one.  If my coin came up heads, there is one fewer \u201chead slot\u201d available for the rest of the infinite population; conversely, if my coin is tails, there is still room for finitely many heads elsewhere.  The coins remain *causally* independent\u2014they do not influence one another\u2014but they are no longer stochastically independent once the conditioning information is incorporated.  And stochastic correlation, not causal connection, is what matters to Bayesian updating.\n\n4.  A limiting-sequence justification  \n\nSceptics sometimes distrust rcp\u2019s because they rely on high-powered measure theory.  There is a more concrete route using ordinary conditionalisation on a nested sequence of high-probability events whose limit is F.\n\nLet  \n\n\u2003F_{m,n} = {exactly m heads among the first n coins, and tails thereafter}.\n\nFor fixed m the events \u222a_{n} F_{m,n} approach the proposition \u201cat most m heads total.\u201d  Taking the further union over m gives F.  Define\n\n\u2003p_{m,n} = P(X\u2080 = 1 | F_{m,n}).\n\nA tedious but straightforward combinatorial calculation shows\n\n\u2003p_{m,n} = m / (n+1).\n\n(Sketch: Condition on the positions of the m heads among the first n coins; given symmetry each of the n+1 positions\u2014n within the block, plus the \u201cextra\u201d position 0\u2014are equally likely to be occupied by the particular participant you are.)  Now fix any m.  As n \u2192 \u221e, p_{m,n} \u2192 0.  Next let m \u2192 \u221e; the uniform bound p_{m,n} \u2264 m/(n+1) ensures the double limit also goes to 0.  Thus the limiting rule of \u201cfirst conditionalise on \u2018not too many heads in the finite block,\u2019 then let the block grow without bound\u201d confirms the rcp value 0.\n\n5.  The independence temptation revisited  \n\nWhy did the intuitive independence argument seem so compelling?  It trades on an illicit substitution:\n\n\u2003\u201cIf H\u2080 does not *cause* (F), then learning (F) offers no *evidence* about H\u2080.\u201d\n\nCausal independence is not the same as evidential independence.  A classic finite analogue is \u201cAll ten fair coins came up tails\u201d entails \u201cMy coin came up tails\u201d with certainty 1, though no causal link exists.  What makes the infinite case puzzling is merely that the evidential force becomes *infinitesimal* in ordinary circumstances.  But once we condition on the measure-zero wonder that only finitely many heads appeared, the joint distribution collapses into a highly atypical subspace in which *someone* is heads only finitely many times.  Causal structure survives; evidential structure does not.\n\n6.  Objections and replies  \n\nObjection 1: Countable additivity is optional in subjective probability; finitely additive probabilities allow P(X\u2080 = 1 | F) = \u00bd while keeping E(S | F) finite.\n\nReply: True in principle, but accepting finite additivity violates ordinary Dutch-book coherence for bets that can be staged in countably many rounds.  Most foundational work in Bayesian epistemology takes countable additivity as non-negotiable.  If one is willing to repudiate it, almost any result can be massaged; that is hardly a stable platform for rational credence.\n\nObjection 2: The argument treats the subject as a *named* individual (\ud835\udc5d\u2080).  What if instead I model my evidence indexically as \u201cI am a randomly selected member of the room\u201d?  There can be no uniform probability distribution over \u2115, so the scarcity argument collapses.\n\nReply: Indexical uncertainty must still be regimented somehow\u2014for instance via weighting by 2^{-i} or via epistemic imprecisions.  Every defensible regimentation that preserves exchangeability will again entail that the probability of being one of the finitely many heads-makers is 0.  The reason is the same cardinality calculation: whichever \u03c3-finite measure you put on the indices, the set of finitely many lucky indices has measure 0, whence the conditional probability of occupying one of them vanishes.\n\nObjection 3: Learning an \u201cimpossible\u201d event in practice means learning something slightly weaker with small but non-zero probability.  In real life we would remain somewhat uncertain whether the testimony is accurate; that uncertainty would screen off the update to 0.\n\nReply: That is perfectly correct as a practical matter.  The puzzle, however, asks for the rational credence *assuming the information is certain.*  Treating it *as if* it had probability 1 is the thought-experiment\u2019s stipulation, and the theoretical lesson emerges only under that heroic idealisation.  Once we embed testimony errors, our credence in F drops from 1 to (say) 0.99, and ordinary conditionalisation on a non-zero event yields a posterior in (H\u2080) that will be *very* small but not 0\u2014exactly what the limiting argument foretells.\n\n7.  Philosophical morals  \n\nMoral 1: Zero-probability learning forces us to choose an rcp, and symmetry plus countable additivity may determine one uniquely.  Where they do, the rcp solution deserves the title of \u201crational posterior.\u201d\n\nMoral 2: Independence is not preserved under conditionalisation on global constraints.  This is a special case of the general rule that Bayesian updating destroys the factorisation of a joint distribution whenever the conditioned event is not cylinder-measurable.  Hence \u201cmy coin is fair\u201d does not license invariant \u00bd credence after hearing exotic facts about the whole ensemble.\n\nMoral 3: Infinite settings sharpen our intuitions about indexicality.  The standard misgiving\u2014\u201cbut I am a *particular* person, not a randomly chosen one\u201d\u2014is answered by exchangeability.  If the world gives no evidence to discriminate agents, rationality demands treating them symmetrically; and symmetry arguments with countable infinities produce highly non-intuitive verdicts.\n\nMoral 4: The puzzle exhibits a cousin of *anthropic reasoning*.  Learning that only finitely many heads exist makes being a heads-person a highly \u201cspecial\u201d status.  Rationally I should think I am probably not that special.  The doomsday argument, the sleeping beauty problem, and other self-locating puzzles all trade on similar scarcity reasoning.\n\n8.  Concluding verdict  \n\nGiven the stipulation that we are certain of (F), the only coherent, symmetry-respecting, countably additive posterior drives the probability of (H\u2080) to 0.  The independence intuition\u2014though psychologically compelling\u2014ignores the fact that evidential dependence can arise without causal influence whenever we restrict attention to a measure-zero slice of possibility space.  Philosophical reflection therefore sides with scarcity:\n\n\u2003Credence(H\u2080 | F) = 0.\n\nIn the strange world where miracles of probability occur, learning that miracle forces you to abandon the usual 50-50 confidence in your own fair coin.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 1, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 3863, "reasoning_tokens": 1152}

Making the mathematics explicit  \nLet \u03a9 = {H,T}^\u2135\u2080 be the set of all infinite sequences (x\u2080,x\u2081,x\u2082,\u2026) where each x_i \u2208 {H,T}.  The natural \u03c3-algebra is the product \u03c3-algebra and the natural probability measure \u03bc is the product of countably many fair Bernoulli(\u00bd) measures.  By Kolmogorov\u2019s 0-1 law, any tail event\u2014one whose truth value is unchanged by altering finitely many coordinates\u2014gets \u03bc-probability 0 or 1.  The event\n\n   F = \u201cOnly finitely many heads occur\u201d = { \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9 : the set {i : \u03c9_i=H} is finite }\n\nis a tail event.  In fact, by the strong law of large numbers or by the Borel-Cantelli lemmas, \u03bc(F)=0: almost surely one gets infinitely many heads and infinitely many tails.\n\nThat means we are being asked to condition not on an unlikely event, but on an impossible one\u2014as judged by our original probability measure.  It is this feature that makes the puzzle philosophically interesting.  If \u03bc(F) had been merely tiny, the ordinary ratio definition of conditional probability would apply and no one would doubt the correctness of answer (B): one can show directly that \u03bc(\u201cmy coin is H\u201d \u2227 F)/\u03bc(F) tends to 0 as \u03bc(F)\u21920.  The crux is whether learning a measure-zero fact can rationally lead to a well-defined belief change at all, and if so, what the change should be.\n\n\n3.  Conditional probability on \u03bc-null events  \nStandard Bayesianism says:\n\n  P_new( \u00b7 ) = P_old( \u00b7 | E ) = P_old( \u00b7 \u2227 E )/P_old(E)\n\nso long as P_old(E)>0.  If P_old(E)=0 the right-hand side is undefined.  One response\u2014call it \u201cdogmatic Bayesianism\u201d\u2014is simply: \u201cYou cannot receive E as evidence if you initially gave it probability 0; your prior was wrong, or you are irrational to believe the report.\u201d  But this answer will not satisfy everyone.  First, the testimony might be compelling; second, physics or mathematics often informs us of measure-zero facts (e.g., \u201cthis dart landed at a rational point on the board\u201d) and we want a theory of rational response.\n\nMeasure theory offers a tool.  A regular conditional probability for a sub-\u03c3-algebra \ud835\udd3e is a family {\u03bc_G : G\u2208\ud835\udd3e} of probability measures such that for every G\u2208\ud835\udd3e and every event A, the function \u03c9\u21a6\u03bc_G(A) is \ud835\udd3e-measurable and integrates to \u03bc(A\u2227G)/\u03bc(G) on G, whenever \u03bc(G)>0.  Where \u03bc(G)=0 the family is allowed to assign an arbitrary probability measure supported on G.  Uniqueness is guaranteed only \u03bc-almost surely; on null sets there is room for choice.  The upshot: mathematics does not dictate a unique way of conditioning on F.  We must supply further principle.\n\nFortunately the present case carries a natural symmetry: the action of any finite or countable permutation of the coin indices preserves both \u03bc and F.  De Finetti famously proved that \u03bc is exchangeable: for any finite k, the joint distribution of (X\u2080,\u2026,X_{k-1}) is invariant under permutation.  The event F is also exchangeable.  The most neutral way to respect that symmetry, I shall argue, is to insist that the conditional measure \u03bc_F inherit exchangeability.  Once we add that stipulation, the conditional distribution turns out to be unique, and it forces credence 0 in \u201cmy coin is heads.\u201d\n\n\n4.  Deriving the 0 answer from symmetry  \nImagine first that you had been told something slightly stronger:\n\n   F_n: \u201cExactly n coins landed heads,\u201d  for some fixed finite n.\n\nEven F_n has \u03bc-measure 0, but its structure is simpler to visualise.  Within F_n, exchangeability implies that every size-n subset of the index set \u2115 is equally likely to be the head-set.  Because \u2115 is countably infinite, the probability that any particular index\u2014say i=0\u2014belongs to a uniformly randomly chosen size-n subset is n/|\u2115|.  But |\u2115| is infinite, and natural cardinal arithmetic tells us n/\u221e=0.  Therefore under any exchangeable probability measure supported by F_n, we must have\n\n   P(X\u2080 = H | F_n) = 0                 (1)\n\nThe same reasoning works if we are told only that \u201cat most n coins landed heads.\u201d  Indeed, the stronger the upper bound, the stronger the case that my specific coin is almost certainly tails.\n\nNow note that F\u2014the event of finitely many heads\u2014is the disjoint union \u22c3_{n\u2208\u2115} F_n.  Any exchangeable probability measure on F must be a countable convex combination of the exchangeable measures on the F_n.  (Intuitively, first pick how many heads there are; then decide which coins receive them.)  Because each constituent assigns 0 probability to X\u2080=H, the mixture also assigns 0:\n\n   P(X\u2080 = H | F) = \u03a3_n P(F_n | F)\u00b7P(X\u2080 = H | F_n) = 0.       (2)\n\nHence if we accept the exchangeability requirement we must accept credence 0.\n\nThere is a quicker way to see the same point.  If I am told that only finitely many coins show heads, I can reason as follows:\n\n  \u2022 There are finitely many heads.  \n  \u2022 There are countably many coins.  \n  \u2022 By simple counting, the proportion of coins that are heads is 0.  \n  \u2022 Absent any individuating information, symmetry dictates that my coin is no likelier than any other to be one of the heads.  \n  \u2022 Therefore my probability is 0.\n\nNotice that this argument does not deny the metaphysical possibility that my coin is heads.  Zero probability in an infinite setting does not mean impossibility; it only reflects a measure-theoretic judgment of \u201cnegligibility.\u201d  But Bayesian probability is precisely a calculus of negligibility: if an outcome sits in a \u03bc-null set, we treat it as carrying zero weight in rational expectation.\n\n\n5.  Objections and replies  \nObjection 1:  \u201cYou cannot legitimately learn a probability-zero event.  Conditioning on it violates Bayesian norms.\u201d\n\nReply.  There is no a priori ban on revising one\u2019s beliefs when confronted with surprising certainty.  What Bayesianism forbids is applying the simple ratio formula when the denominator is zero.  It does not forbid adopting a new probability measure whose support lies inside what used to be a null set.  The move from \u03bc to \u03bc_F is a case of \u201cradical Bayesian updating\u201d or \u201chypothesis elimination\u201d: we discard every outcome incompatible with the testimony and renormalise the remainder in a symmetry-preserving way.  That is entirely in the spirit of Carnapian inductive logic and de Finetti\u2019s \u201ccoherent\u201d betting framework.  What the dogmatic objection really highlights is that ordinary Bayesian conditionalisation is incomplete: it supplies no update rule for zero-probability evidence, so one must appeal to extra-Bayesian principles such as maximum entropy, symmetry, or jeffrey-type relaxation.  In the present case, permutation symmetry supplies exactly what is needed.\n\nObjection 2: \u201cBut surely my coin\u2019s landing heads is causally independent of the behaviour of all the others.  Learning about them should not affect my credence about this coin.\u201d\n\nReply.  Causal independence is not the same as probabilistic independence once we restrict to a sub-\u03c3-algebra of possible worlds.  To see the point, imagine two independent fair coins C\u2081 and C\u2082.  Unconditionally they are independent.  But if I learn the total number of heads is 1, they become perfectly anti-correlated.  Knowledge that C\u2081=H instantly tells me C\u2082=T.  No causal interaction is invoked; the dependence is purely informational, induced by the conditioning event.  The same phenomenon, magnified to countable infinity, lies behind our puzzle.  Although each flip is physically independent, the testimony \u201conly finitely many heads\u201d couples their outcomes in the web of epistemic possibility.  Once I accept that information, the probability space in which I reason is one in which the overwhelming majority of coins are tails, and thus my own most likely shows tails.\n\nObjection 3: \u201cCardinal arithmetic n/\u221e=0 is suspicious.  Why should dividing a finite number by countable infinity yield 0 rather than an infinitesimal \u03b5>0?\u201d\n\nReply.  Standard Kolmogorov probability assigns real-valued measures, not hyperreal infinitesimals.  Within that framework, any set of the same cardinality as \u2115 gets measure either 0 or some strictly positive real number.  Exchangeability forces us to spread total probability 1 uniformly (in a finitely additive sense) over \u2135\u2080 many possibilities; that is feasible only by assigning each possibility 0.  One may of course experiment with non-standard probability theories featuring infinitesimals, but doing so moves the goal-posts.  The puzzle was posed against the background of ordinary real-valued probability; the 0 answer is the one delivered by that background.\n\n\n6.  Why the \u00bd answer is so tempting  \nSetting my credence to 0 does not feel natural.  Intuitively, 0 expresses certainty; yet I certainly do not feel certain my coin is tails.  Where does the intuition go wrong?\n\nFirst, 0 does not represent metaphysical or even epistemic certainty in the presence of an infinite outcome-space.  One can coherently buy a ticket that pays \\$1 if my coin is heads for any positive price; the probability calculus merely says the fair price is 0.  The distinction between impossibility and measure-zero possibility is easy to overlook.\n\nSecond, humans instinctively think in terms of frequencies in large finite samples.  If you picture one trillion flips and only finitely many heads, you may imagine 10 or 100 or 1,000 heads, and then your chance of being a head is 10\u207b\u00b9\u00b2 or 10\u207b\u00b9\u2070 or 10\u207b\u2079\u2014numbers that feel \u201cpractically zero\u201d yet not quite zero, so you round back up to \u201croughly \u00bd\u201d because that is the default.  But letting the sample size grow without bound while the number of heads is kept fixed forces the relative frequency strictly to 0 in the limit.  Our finite-minded heuristics resist that limit.\n\nThird, Bayesian conditionalisation on measure-zero events is not part of everyday reasoning.  In ordinary statistical life we nearly always deal with events of positive likelihood.  Hence we lack the experiential anchor that would make the 0 answer feel as obvious as it mathematically is.\n\nFinally, some philosophers read the principal principle\u2014\u201cyour credence should match the objective chance if known\u201d\u2014as supporting the \u00bd answer.  Yet that principle applies only when the objective chance is defined conditional on the total information you possess.  The very thing at issue is what the objective chance is given the information that only finitely many heads occur.  Once we incorporate that information, the chance changes.\n\n\n7.  What if we adopt a different regularisation?  \nCould one define a non-exchangeable conditional probability on F that keeps P(X\u2080=H)=\u00bd?  In principle yes: because F has \u03bc-measure 0, Kolmogorov gives us carte blanche to paint any probability distribution we like on it so long as it stays inside F.  For example, put all the probability mass on the single outcome in which the first coin (mine) is heads and every other coin tails.  That bizarre measure would indeed satisfy P(X\u2080=H|F)=1.  But by the same token it violates every intuitive symmetry of the problem.  To accept such a measure is to treat the index 0 coin as special for no reason whatsoever.  Most philosophers and mathematicians regard that violation of symmetry as a decisive reductio.\n\nThe moral is that updating on probability-zero evidence is unavoidably underdetermined by pure measure theory.  One must inject further rational constraints\u2014usually symmetry or a maximum-entropy rule\u2014to fix a unique posterior.  Once those constraints are made explicit in the present case, the posterior credence in heads becomes 0.\n\n\n8.  Conclusion  \nOur initial, pre-evidence credence that the coin we happen to hold lands heads is \u00bd, by fairness.  Upon learning the astounding fact that only finitely many of countably infinitely many coins land heads\u2014a fact that had prior probability 0\u2014we must abandon the original product measure and adopt a new probability measure concentrated on the newly revealed possibility-set.  Requiring the new measure to respect the obvious permutation symmetries of the situation forces it to distribute probability so thinly over the finitely many heads that every individual coin almost surely lies outside that elite group.  The unique, symmetry-respecting regular conditional gives:\n\n   P_new(\u201cmy coin is heads\u201d) = 0.\n\nThe lesson is twofold.  First, probability-zero evidence can rationally trigger drastic belief revisions, but only when accompanied by principled criteria\u2014such as symmetry\u2014for pinning down a revised distribution.  Second, causal independence does not shield events from becoming probabilistically dependent once we learn global constraints.  In the strange realm of the infinite, learning that a population contains merely finitely many exceptions makes being an exception a probability-0 status.

You know that all the coin flips are fair and independent. You are then informed that something remarkable happened: only finitely many coins landed heads. What should your credence be that your coin landed heads? Should it remain at 1/2, or should it change? Provide arguments for your answer.", "answer": "Heads or Tails in a Sea of Coins:\nA Philosophical Analysis of Updating on a Probability-Zero Event\n\u2248 2\u2009000 words  \n\n1. The Set-Up  \n\nImagine a denumerably infinite row of agents, each holding an identical, fair coin. All the coins are tossed once, independently and simultaneously, and no one looks at the outcome. Before anyone sees anything, every agent is completely certain of three facts:\n\n\u2022 Each individual toss is fair, so P(Heads) = \u00bd for every coin considered in isolation.  \n\u2022 The tosses are mutually independent.  \n\u2022 From these two facts it follows that, with probability 1, infinitely many heads and infinitely many tails will be observed; the expected number of heads is infinite and the variance is infinite as well.\n\nNow an announcement is made: something extraordinary occurred\u2014only finitely many of the coins (say n < \u221e of them) landed Heads. You, like everyone else, accept that the announcement is accurate. What ought your credence now be that your own coin showed Heads?\n\nTwo natural but competing reactions suggest themselves.\n\nReaction A (Conservatism): \u201cThe announcement is about the joint pattern, not about my coin in particular. Absent any coin-specific evidence I should keep the prior \u00bd.\u201d\n\nReaction B (Holism): \u201cIf altogether only finitely many Heads were tossed among countably many fairness-guaranteed trials, the overall proportion of Heads is 0. That must drastically lower the chance that my particular coin is one of the rare Heads; the rational posterior is 0.\u201d\n\nWhich reaction is correct? I will argue that the holist answer\u2014credence 0\u2014is rationally mandatory once the announcement is accepted, but also explain why the case is philosophically delicate: it involves updating on an event of probability 0, and Bayesian orthodoxy leaves such updates non-unique unless further constraints are imposed. Sorting the constraints reveals the deep tension between local independence and global information in infinite settings.  \n\n2. Why \u201cOnly Finitely Many Heads\u201d Has Prior Probability 0  \n\nLet Hi be the indicator that coin i lands Heads, and let S = \u03a3Hi be the (possibly infinite) total number of Heads. Because the Hi are i.i.d. Bernoulli(\u00bd),\n\nP(S = k) = 0 for every finite k,  \nP(S = \u221e) = 1.\n\nOne way to see this is by Kolmogorov\u2019s 0-1 law: the event \u201conly finitely many Heads\u201d is a tail event (it is unchanged by altering any finite subset of tosses) and has probability either 0 or 1. The expected number of Heads, E[S] = \u221e, so probability 1 is impossible; therefore P(S < \u221e) = 0.\n\nThus the announcement presents us with a probability-zero event. Standard conditional probability P(A | B) = P(A\u2227B)/P(B) is undefined when P(B)=0. So merely repeating \u201cconditionalize!\u201d is not enough; we must decide how to extend Bayesian updating to measure-zero cases.   \n\n3. Regular Conditional Probabilities and Limiting Procedures  \n\nThe canonical fix is to replace crude ratios with a regular conditional probability (RCP): a \u03c3-additive function P*(\u00b7 | F) that is defined for almost every outcome in F, satisfies the Bayes law for all positive-probability subsets of F and recovers ordinary conditionalisation whenever that is defined. Existence is guaranteed on standard (Polish) probability spaces; uniqueness is not. Distinct RCPs correspond to distinct ways of approximating an event of probability 0 by events of positive probability.\n\nSo the real question is not \u201cWhat is P(Hi | S < \u221e)?\u201d in abstraction\u2014that is under-determined\u2014but \u201cWhich RCP, if any, is epistemically privileged for a rational updater who receives exactly the information \u2018S < \u221e\u2019?\u201d  \n\n4. The Natural Approximation: \u2018At Most N Heads\u2019  \n\nA compelling approximation scheme is:\n\nFn := {S \u2264 n} \u2003(n \u2208 \u2115).\n\nEach Fn has positive probability and Fn \u2193 F := {S < \u221e}. Moreover they preserve the intuitive content of the announcement: that the number of Heads is bounded. Taking n \u2192 \u221e seems an obvious way to \u2018learn\u2019 that S is finite while staying inside ordinary conditionalisation at every finite stage.\n\nWhat posterior does this limiting path deliver?\n\nCompute for any fixed coin k:  \n\nP( Hk \u2227 Fn ) = (\u00bd) P( S\u2264n\u22121 ) because Hk uses up one of the \u2264 n Heads.  \nP( Fn )       = P( S\u2264n ).\n\nTherefore  \n\nP( Hk | Fn ) = P( Hk \u2227 Fn ) / P( Fn )  \n             = \u00bd \u00b7 P( S\u2264n\u22121 ) / P( S\u2264n ).\n\nBut P( S\u2264n ) \u2013 P( S\u2264n\u22121 ) = P( S = n ) > 0, and P( S = n ) falls super-exponentially (a negative binomial series). Consequently  \n\nP( Hk | Fn ) \u2264 \u00bd \u00b7 P( S\u2264n\u22121 ) / P( S\u2264n\u22121 + P(S=n) )  \n            = \u00bd \u00b7 1 / (1 + P(S=n)/P(S\u2264n\u22121))  \n            < \u00bd.\n\nThe ratio goes to 0 as n grows: the probability mass in P(S\u2264n) is concentrated overwhelmingly at the largest admissible value n; but if Hk is Heads we must move to n\u22121 or less. One can make this precise via Stirling\u2019s approximation, obtaining\n\nlim_{n\u2192\u221e} P( Hk | Fn ) = 0.\n\nHence the RCP generated by the canonical bounded-Heads sequence mandates posterior credence 0.  \n\n5. Exchangeability and de Finetti\u2019s Representation  \n\nAnother route uses symmetry. The initial (prior) joint distribution over \u27e8Hi\u27e9 is exchangeable. Upon conditioning on \u201cS<\u221e\u201d, the updated distribution must still be exchangeable because that event is permutation-invariant. De Finetti\u2019s theorem tells us that an exchangeable sequence of Bernoullis is a mixture of i.i.d. sequences with some mixing measure \u03bc over p= P(Heads) values. Before the announcement, \u03bc is the point mass at p=\u00bd. After learning S<\u221e, what mixture yields finite total Heads almost surely?\n\nOnly the degenerate component p=0 does. Any p>0 gives infinite Heads \u03bc-a.s. Conversely p=0 yields S=0 finitely (indeed exactly zero) \u03bc-a.s. Therefore the conditional mixture collapses to p=0, making every Hi almost surely Tails. Credence in \u2018my coin is Heads\u2019 must be 0.\n\nThis argument bypasses the technicalities of regular conditional probabilities altogether; it exploits the qualitative probabilistic fact that finiteHeads is incompatible with any strictly positive per-trial Head chance.  \n\n6. Can a Posterior of \u00bd be Defended?  \n\nAdvocates of the conservative reaction appeal to two principles:\n\na. Locality: My coin toss is still a fair, independent micro-event; the announcement concerns only the global pattern.  \nb. Principle of Indifference: Absent coin-specific evidence symmetry dictates \u00bd.\n\nYet these principles cannot be jointly sustained with the announcement. Suppose your posterior for each Hi were still \u00bd and the Hi remained independent. Then the expected number of Heads, conditional on S<\u221e, would still be infinite (\u221e\u00b7\u00bd). But by hypothesis you are completely certain the number is finite\u2014a contradiction. Independence, fairness, and finiteHeads cannot all hold simultaneously. The announcement forces you to abandon at least one. The natural one to give up is independence/fairness of each coin, because that is exactly what the new information undermines: it creates global negative correlation among the Hi.  \n\n7. A Borel-like Paradox?  \n\nIn finite-dimensional conditioning on a zero-measure manifold (e.g. conditioning a spherical distribution on latitude 0\u00b0) yields different answers depending on the limiting approach used: the classic Borel paradox. Is our case similar? In fact no. Any reasonable filtration that respects permutation symmetry and is measurable with respect to the tail \u03c3-algebra leads to the same RCP we already met. The event \u201cS<\u221e\u201d lives in the tail \u03c3-field, which is trivial under the prior measure; the only consistent update that preserves exchangeability sends \u03bc to \u03b40 and each Hi to probability 0. So the posterior is in practice unique once we add the mild, epistemically natural constraint of exchangeability.\n\nOne can, of course, cook up bizarre approximations (e.g. condition on \u2018at most n Heads in the first n\u00b2 coins\u2019) that keep P(Hi)=\u00bd in the limit. But those approximations encode extra illicit information about the indexing of coins, information not provided by the bare announcement. Because rational agents should disregard arbitrary indexings, such updates violate the symmetry (or \u2018relevance\u2019) principles that justified indifference in the first place.  \n\n8. Intuitive Picture: Urns, Tickets, and Sparse Winners  \n\nThink of the infinite population as an urn containing one ticket per person. Exactly n tickets are secretly coloured red (\u2018Head\u2019); the rest stay white. You are handed a randomly selected ticket but cannot look at its colour yet. If you are only told that the urn is infinite while reds are finite, it is overwhelmingly plausible that the ticket you hold is white: the reds are \u201csparse.\u201d Your chance of having drawn one of the finitely many reds out of a proper class of whites should be 0. The coin example is just a dynamically generated version of the sparse-reds urn, and the same intuition applies.\n\nSome commentators object that 0 credence seems incompatible with the logical possibility that your coin is red\u2014after all, you might be one of the lucky few. But probability 0 of A does not mean A is impossible; it only means that A is measure-theoretically negligible relative to the given information. Countably many specific sequences of Who-Got-Heads collectively cover the finiteHeads event, yet each such sequence itself has probability 0. This is common in continuous models (a dart landing at exactly 0.5 on [0,1]); the present case is a discrete-infinite analogue.  \n\n9. Decision-Theoretic Support  \n\nSuppose you are offered two gambles, priced at fair expectation:\n\nG1: win $1 if your own coin is Heads. Expected value at \u00bd: $0.50.  \nG2: win $1 if at least one coin in the room is Heads. Expected value prior: $1 (because prior probability of \u201cno Heads\u201d is 0).\n\nAfter the announcement \u201conly finitely many Heads,\u201d but before learning how many or who they are, compare the gambles. Under a \u00bd posterior for your coin, G1 would still be worth $0.50, whereas under the holist posterior, G1 is worth $0. Analogously, G2 is now worth $1 because you know finitely (hence at least one) Heads occurred. If you kept the \u00bd valuation you would still view G1 as half as attractive as G2, but if you coherently integrate the new information you must prefer G2 infinitely more: it is guaranteed to pay $1, G1 is practically certain to pay $0. So any agent that sticks to \u00bd would be exploitable by a Dutch book as follows: simultaneously buy from her G2 for $0.99 (she thinks its value $1) and sell her G1 for $0.49 (she thinks its value $0.50). Net gain $0.50 guaranteed to the bookie, loss to the agent, whenever S<\u221e. Coherence requires revising the \u00bd.\n\n10. Philosophical Up-Shot: Local vs Global Information in the Infinite  \n\nThe heart of the puzzle is that a single tail fact about an infinite family can override every local fact about each member. In finite contexts, independence plus identical marginals is compatible with any global constraint formulated solely in terms of the sum; the constraint merely introduces negative correlation. But in the infinite limit the negative correlation becomes maximal, forcing each marginal probability all the way down to 0.\n\nThis phenomenon mirrors other measure-zero updates that break factorisation\u2014e.g. conditioning a two-dimensional Gaussian on X+Y=0 yields perfect anticorrelation even though X and Y were independent a moment before.\n\nFor philosophers, the case offers lessons on:\n\n\u2022 The limits of the Principle of Indifference: one must heed all the evidence, even non-local evidence.  \n\u2022 The non-Boolean structure of Bayesian conditionalisation when confronted with impossible-but-possible information.  \n\u2022 The fragility of independence assumptions under global data, a moral relevant to the Sleeping Beauty debate, anthropic reasoning, and infinite ethics.\n\n11. Objections and Replies  \n\nObjection 1. The announcement could in principle be false\u2014probability-zero events have probability 0, not impossibility\u2014so conditionalising on it at all violates Bayesian dogma that one should never update on information you expected with probability 0.\n\nReply: Bayesianism forbids assigning probability 1 to contingent propositions; it does not forbid updating on events to which you gave probability 0. Think of winning the jackpot: before the draw P=10-8, yet if you see all the matching numbers you rationally update to certainty you won. Likewise here; receiving probability-zero evidence is entirely admissible though it forces you to deploy the RCP machinery.\n\nObjection 2. If credence becomes 0, how could you ever rationally believe your coin is Heads even after you look? Seeing a Head is logically compatible with the announcement, yet on your model has posterior probability 0, contradicting your sight.\n\nReply: Once you look, you receive new evidence distinct from the announcement: \u201cMy coin is Heads.\u201d Conditionalize again; that forces the posterior to jump from 0 to 1. Probability 0 to 1 updates are permitted because 0 is not impossibility; it is merely measure-zero given earlier data.\n\nObjection 3. The conditional expectation argument presupposes exchangeability; suppose the agents are labelled by the natural numbers and the \u2018finitely many Heads\u2019 happen to occur among the first ten coins. Then if I know I am randomly selected from the end of the row, maybe \u00bd is right for me.\n\nReply: The original thought-experiment says only that \u201cyou\u201d are one of the countably many people, with no extra location information. Any label-sensitive update uses information not in the common announcement. If additional self-locating facts are supplied, the correct posterior may indeed differ; but holding those fixed, symmetry trumps indexical fantasies.\n\n12. Conclusion  \n\nConditioning on \u201conly finitely many Heads\u201d transforms the probabilistic landscape. Because a fair, independent Bernoulli(\u00bd) process nearly surely produces infinitely many Heads, learning that finitely many occurred is as epistemically catastrophic for the original model as learning that water is not H2O would be for chemistry. The only coherent regular conditional probability respecting the symmetry of the problem assigns probability 0 to any particular coin\u2019s being Heads. Any attempt to hang on to the original \u00bd marginal contradicts the finite-Heads datum, violates exchangeability, and exposes the agent to Dutch books.\n\nTherefore your rational credence that your coin landed Heads, upon accepting the miraculous announcement, should be 0, not \u00bd. The case is a vivid reminder that in the infinite, global facts decisively shape local probabilities, and that conditioning on probability-zero events demands careful, measure-theoretically informed treatment lest intuition go astray.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 3, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 3983, "reasoning_tokens": 640}

The puzzle  \n\nCountably many people, labelled 0, 1, 2, \u2026 , each toss a fair and independent coin in the usual sense: before any information is revealed the unconditional probability of heads (H) for each coin is \u00bd and the joint distribution is the product measure (\u00bd, \u00bd)^\u2115.  After the tosses an oracle announces the following astonishing fact:\n\n\u2003F: \u201cOnly finitely many of the coins landed heads.\u201d\n\nF has prior probability 0.  (Kolmogorov\u2019s 0\u20131 law or the second Borel\u2013Cantelli lemma implies that, with probability 1, infinitely many heads occur.)  You are person 0 and you have not looked at your own coin.  The question is:\n\n\u2003Given F, what ought your personal credence be that your own coin landed heads?  \n\nA quick, intuitive reaction says \u201c\u00bd\u2014why should the global announcement matter to my local, independent toss?\u201d  An equally quick, opposing intuition says \u201cthe set of heads is finite and there are infinitely many people, so the chance that the special finite set happens to contain me should be 0.\u201d  Behind the clash of intuitions lies a serious technical issue: how, if at all, should a Bayesian conditionalise on an event that had probability 0 under the prior?  I shall argue that, once we impose the two natural constraints that (i) the update respect the symmetry of the situation and (ii) the update be given by a regular conditional probability (i.e. the probability-theoretic extension of Bayes\u2019 rule to measure-zero events), the rational credence for heads is 0.  I then examine the objections that motivate retaining \u00bd, and explain why they fail once the subtleties of conditioning on measure-zero events are made explicit.  In closing I draw some lessons for the epistemology of probability\u2010zero information.\n\nThe discussion is self-contained, but interested readers may consult L\u00e9vy (1937), Blackwell and Dubins (1962), H\u00e1jek (2003) and recent work on the \u201cdoomsday\u201d and \u201crandom observer\u201d paradoxes for further background.\n\n2.  Why ordinary conditionalisation does not apply  \n\nFor events of positive probability Bayes\u2019 rule is unproblematic:\n\n\u2003P(A | B) = P(A\u2227B)/P(B)     provided P(B)>0.\n\nWhen P(B)=0 the ratio is undefined.  Philosophers sometimes speak loosely of \u201cconditioning on probability-zero events\u201d, but strictly speaking one must replace the ratio by a **regular conditional probability measure**.  Given a \u03c3-algebra \ud835\udd3d and an underlying probability space (\u03a9,\ud835\udc9c,P), a regular conditional P(\u00b7 | \ud835\udd3d)(\u03c9) is a family of probability measures that (i) coincides with ordinary conditional probability when the conditioning event has positive probability, and (ii) is measurable in \u03c9.  Regular conditionals always exist for standard Borel spaces, and they are unique up to P-null sets, but they are often **non-unique on a given probability-zero event**.  In other words, different regularisations of Bayes\u2019 rule can assign different posteriors to the very same information F.  So before we ask whether the correct answer is 0 or \u00bd, we must ask what constraints single out the \u201cright\u201d regular conditional.\n\n3.  Two natural constraints  \n\nC1. Symmetry (exchangeability).  The prior treats all coins alike.  Learning F does not single out any particular agent; it merely says that the set of heads is finite.  Any posterior that broke symmetry between persons 0,1,2,\u2026 would therefore import information that the oracle never gave us.  \n\nC2. Tail-measurability.  The event F depends only on the \u201ctail\u201d of the sequence\u2014informally, no finite block of coins suffices to determine whether F is true.  Hence, by L\u00e9vy\u2019s zero-one law, F is independent of every finite initial segment of the sequence.  The usual way of capturing such independence inside regular conditional probabilities is to require that the posterior sit on the **tail \u03c3-algebra**, exactly as in the Kolmogorov\u2013Levy martingale convergence theorem.\n\nUnder these two constraints, the regular conditional probability is unique, and it yields credence 0 for your head.  Here is the argument in three mutually reinforcing ways.\n\n4.  Three routes to the result \u201cH with probability 0\u201d  \n\n4.1  The proportion argument  \n\nLet I_i be the indicator of heads for person i.  Exchangeability implies\n\n\u2003E(I_0 | F) = E( (1/n)\u2211_{i=0}^{n-1} I_i | F )      for every n\u22651,\n\nbecause the conditional expectation of any particular I_i given F must equal the conditional expectation of their finite average.  But under F at most finitely many of the I_i equal 1, so\n\n\u2003lim_{n\u2192\u221e} (1/n)\u2211_{i=0}^{n-1} I_i = 0    with F-probability 1.\n\nTaking expectations and using dominated convergence gives\n\n\u2003E(I_0 | F) = 0.\n\nSo the posterior probability that your own coin is heads is 0.\n\n4.2  The \u201crandom natural number\u201d analogy  \n\nImagine numbering the (possibly) finitely many heads in increasing order and then choosing a random natural number, n, independent of the coin tosses.  The probability that n lies in a fixed finite set is 0.  Conditioning on F amounts to asserting that the set of heads, call it H*, is finite; the probability that a random index (person 0, in particular) lies in H* is therefore 0.  The analogy is exact once we formalise \u201crandom index\u201d via the product measure and the canonical projection.\n\n4.3  The de Finetti\u2013Schervish computation  \n\nDe Finetti\u2019s representation is not directly applicable because the common success probability is fixed at \u00bd.  Nevertheless we can write the joint law as a mixture over the latent empirical frequency \u03b8 = limsup (1/n)\u2211_{i<n} I_i.  The prior puts all its mass on \u03b8=\u00bd.  The event F is contained in {\u03b8=0}.  When we condition on F we necessarily move all of our probability mass to \u03b8=0.  Given \u03b8=0 the conditional probability for any particular I_i is 0.  Thus P(I_0=1 | F)=0.\n\nNotice that the three routes use nothing that distinguishes person 0 from the others; indeed any fixed finite coalition of people has probability 0 of comprising one of the finitely many heads.  The result is therefore a direct corollary of C1 and C2.\n\n5.  The intuitive objection: \u201cIndependence should block learning\u201d  \n\nThe strongest temptation to stick with \u00bd rests on the following line of thought:\n\n\u2003(a) My coin was tossed before I learned F.  \n\u2003(b) It was physically independent of the other coins.  \n\u2003(c) Learning F only concerns the outcomes of the other coins, so  \n\u2003(d) It should not affect the probability of my own outcome.  \n\nStep (b) is correct; step (a) is irrelevant; step (c) is partially correct; but step (d) is a non-sequitur.  Independence can be destroyed by conditioning.  A textbook illustration is two independent fair coins A and B: unconditionally they are independent, but conditioned on the event \u201cA\u2260B\u201d they become negatively correlated.  Our case is merely the infinite analogue.  The initial product measure makes the coins independent; the zero-probability event F correlates them maximally (they must \u201cconspire\u201d so that only finitely many are heads).  So learning F does create extremely strong statistical dependence between your coin and the rest.  Under that dependence the probability that you were one of finitely many lucky heads falls to 0.\n\n6.  The technical objection: \u201cRegular conditionals are not unique, so \u00bd is permissible\u201d  \n\nTrue: if one removes either C1 or C2 one can cook up a bizarre regular conditional that assigns probability \u00bd (or \u2153, or \u221a2/\u03c0, or anything in [0,1]) to I_0=1 given F.  For instance, fix an arbitrary well-ordering of sequences with finitely many heads, search for the first position in which two sequences differ, and let that position govern how probability is split.  Such disintegrations exist (this is a version of **Borel\u2019s paradox**).  But they all violate symmetry.  They either privilege person 0 a priori or embed some external well-ordering into the updating rule.  Nothing in F, and nothing in the fair-coin hypothesis, justifies doing either.  If *rationality* is taken to mean *respecting the evidential symmetry of the problem*, then only the symmetric regular conditional is admissible, and that conditional gives credence 0.\n\n7.  A concrete operational test  \n\nSuppose a bookmaker offers you the following bet after the oracle\u2019s announcement: pay $1 now, receive $k > 0 if your coin is heads.  At what odds k would you regard the gamble as fair?  If you stick with credence \u00bd you will accept whenever k\u22652.  But consider the sequence of moments at which you and your co-participants inspect your coins in turn.  Each time a person discovers tails the posterior odds that the *remaining* unseen coins contain one of the finitely many heads worsens.  By optional stopping and symmetry one can construct a martingale that forces a sure loss on anyone who buys the bet at k=2 but sells it back whenever they learn that their own coin is tails.  No such Dutch book arises for the player who assigns credence 0 from the outset.  This provides pragmatic corroboration for the theoretical conclusion.\n\n8.  Philosophical morals  \n\n8.1  Learning probability-zero truths.  Bayesian conditionalisation can be extended to measure-zero events, but additional structural principles (here: symmetry and tail-measurability) are needed to make the update unique.  Without these principles \u201canything goes\u201d; with them the update can be perfectly determinate even when the learned event was deemed practically impossible ex ante.\n\n8.2  Independence is fragile under learning.  The case underlines a moral familiar from quantum entanglement: physical or causal independence at the prior does not entail epistemic independence after new information is received.  One can learn about one variable by learning a global constraint that ties many variables together.\n\n8.3  Infinite idealisations matter.  In any *finite* group of coin-flippers the same announcement (\u201conly finitely many heads\u201d, now necessarily \u201cat most N heads\u201d) would marginally *raise* the probability that your own coin is heads, because the base-rate of heads has been lowered but not eliminated.  The limit as N\u2192\u221e reverses the effect entirely.  Philosophers who are uneasy about idealisations to \u03c9-sequence lotteries must therefore decide whether the pathology is an artefact or a genuine feature of rational belief in infinite settings.\n\n9.  Conclusion  \n\nUnder the usual Bayesian norms, augmented by the minimal symmetry and tail-measurability constraints that are already implicit in the problem statement, one must update to posterior credence\n\n\u2003P(\u201cmy coin is heads\u201d | F) = 0.\n\nThe argument is not a refutation of independence, nor does it rest on mysterious \u201ccausal influence\u201d from the other tosses; it simply recognises that learning the probability-zero fact F carves away all those independent product worlds in which infinitely many heads occur, leaving only the highly correlated worlds in which the empirical frequency of heads is 0.  In those worlds the chance that any particular person belongs to the privileged finite set of heads is 0.  The initially tempting answer \u00bd survives only if one is prepared to ignore the evidential symmetry of the situation or to tolerate non-regular disintegrations of the prior\u2014moves that, on reflection, carry an unacceptable epistemic cost.\n\nThose who find the conclusion uncomfortable should perhaps take comfort, or feel renewed unease, in its very source: the paradoxical behaviour of probability at the frontier where the \u201calmost impossible\u201d becomes actual.  Bayesianism can accommodate learning the impossible, but only by forcing us to revise even those credences\u2014like \u00bd for a fair coin\u2014that seemed immune to revision.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 4, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 4453, "reasoning_tokens": 1728}

I first show informally why that answer seems unavoidable, then give a more rigorous derivation by way of an approximating\u2010sequence argument, and finally rebut the most natural reasons for insisting that the credence ought to stay at 1\u20442.\n\n1.  Setting the stage  \n\nLet \u2115 = {1,2,3,\u2026} index the people in the room.  For each i\u2208\u2115, let H\u1d62 be the indicator random variable that equals 1 when the ith coin lands heads and 0 when it lands tails.  Our probability space (\u03a9,\ud835\udd3d,\ud835\udc43) is the usual infinite product of copies of the fair\u2010coin space, with the product \u03c3\u2013algebra and independent \u00bd\u2013\u00bd product measure.  The event we learn is  \n\nF := {\u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9 : \u03a3_{i=1}^{\u221e} H\u1d62(\u03c9) < \u221e}.  \n\nBecause the expected number of heads in an infinite sequence of fair flips is infinite and, by the second Borel\u2013Cantelli lemma, infinitely many heads occur with \ud835\udc43\u2010probability 1, we have \ud835\udc43(F)=0.  That already warns us that ordinary conditional probability \ud835\udc43(\u2022|F) is undefined; we shall need a more careful story about how to update on F.\n\n2.  The intuitive argument for credence 0  \n\nSuppose you have been told with certainty that only finitely many of the countably many coins landed heads.  If there are only finitely many heads among countably many coins, then \u201cmost\u201d coins\u2014indeed, all except a finite handful\u2014must be tails.  Now focus on your own labelled coin, say coin #k.  Nothing you have learnt singles out coin #k for special treatment; the information concerns only the global pattern of heads and tails.  In any world in F there exists an N such that for all n>N, H_n=0.  For any fixed k, we can always choose N larger than k, so it is entirely possible that the finitely many heads are all located among coins with indices less than k and that H_k=0.  What is the probability that k itself makes it into the finite \u201chead list\u201d?  In a purely combinatorial sense it is 0 : when infinitely many positions compete for finitely many slots, every particular position is almost surely excluded.\n\nA useful analogy: imagine writing the natural numbers on slips of paper, mixing them thoroughly in a box, and then blindly drawing finitely many slips.  Before you peek at the slips you have drawn, what probability should you assign to the claim \u201cthe slip numbered k is in my hand\u201d?  It should be 0, because out of the infinitely many slips only finitely many were picked; the probability that any specified slip is among them vanishes.  The same \u201cvanishing\u2010share\u201d intuition applies to the head event H_k=1 conditional on F.\n\n3.  Making the intuition precise  \n\nIntuition, however, is not always trustworthy at probability 0, and we need a principled updating rule.  Among the many proposals available (Jeffrey\u2019s method, Lewis\u2019s conditional credence, van Fraassen\u2019s ratio formula, etc.) the most conservative is to define the conditional probability by a limiting sequence of positive\u2013probability events that shrink down to F.  The sequence that suggests itself here is\n\nF_n := {\u03c9 : \u03a3_{i=1}^{\u221e} H\u1d62(\u03c9) \u2264 n},\u2003n\u2208\u2115.\n\nEach F_n has strictly positive probability (in fact exponentially small, but non-zero) and \u22c2_{n=1}^{\u221e} F_n = F.  Write\n\np_{k,n} := \ud835\udc43(H_k=1 | F_n).\n\nIf lim_{n\u2192\u221e} p_{k,n} exists, we may adopt that limit as \ud835\udc43(H_k=1 | F).\n\n(Strictly speaking, we should first verify that the limit is independent of the particular approximating sequence; I return to that in section 6.  For the moment, let us compute.)\n\nBecause the product measure is exchangeable, every coin has the same conditional distribution.  Indeed, for fixed n and k,\n\n\ud835\udc43(H_k=1 \u2227 F_n) = (\u00bd)\u00b7\ud835\udc43(\u03a3_{i\u2260k} H\u1d62 \u2264 n\u22121)\n\nand\n\n\ud835\udc43(F_n) = (\u00bd)\u00b7\ud835\udc43(\u03a3_{i\u2260k} H\u1d62 \u2264 n\u22121) + (\u00bd)\u00b7\ud835\udc43(\u03a3_{i\u2260k} H\u1d62 \u2264 n).\n\nHence\n\np_{k,n} = \ud835\udc43(H_k=1 | F_n) = (\u00bd)\u00b7\ud835\udc43(S\u2264n\u22121) / [(\u00bd)\u00b7\ud835\udc43(S\u2264n\u22121)+(\u00bd)\u00b7\ud835\udc43(S\u2264n)],\n\nwhere S := \u03a3_{i\u2260k} H\u1d62.  Now S is an infinite count of independent Bernoulli(\u00bd) trials, so \ud835\udc43(S\u2264m) tends monotonically down to 0 as m increases but is always positive and finite.  Because \ud835\udc43(S\u2264n\u22121)\u2264\ud835\udc43(S\u2264n), the fraction is at most \u00bd, but we can obtain a sharper estimate:\n\n\ud835\udc43(S\u2264n\u22121) \u2264 2^{\u2212n}\u00b7C(n),\u2003for some polynomial C(n).\n\nAs n grows large, \ud835\udc43(S\u2264n\u22121) and \ud835\udc43(S\u2264n) are both doubly\u2010exponentially tiny, but crucially their ratio \ud835\udc43(S\u2264n\u22121)/\ud835\udc43(S\u2264n) goes to 0; in fact\n\nlim_{n\u2192\u221e} \ud835\udc43(S\u2264n\u22121) / \ud835\udc43(S\u2264n) = 0,\n\nbecause adding the possibility \u201cexactly n heads\u201d contributes asymptotically far more weight than was already present.  Consequently,\n\nlim_{n\u2192\u221e} p_{k,n} = 0.\n\nTherefore, using this perfectly natural approximating sequence of positive\u2010probability events, one arrives at\n\n\ud835\udc43(H_k=1 | F) = 0.\n\n4.  A symmetry\u2010based derivation  \n\nAnother, perhaps simpler, route appeals only to symmetry and linearity of expectation.  Assume for the moment that some regular conditional probability \ud835\udc44(\u2022|F) exists (in whatever sense) and that it is permutation\u2010invariant, i.e. it treats each labelled coin identically.  Let N(\u03c9) = \u03a3_{i=1}^{\u221e} H\u1d62(\u03c9) denote the total number of heads.  Because F says \u201cN is finite,\u201d N takes values in \u2115 under \ud835\udc44(\u2022|F) and hence has finite expected value:\n\n\ud835\udd3c_\ud835\udc44[N | F] = \u03a3_{k=0}^{\u221e} k\u00b7\ud835\udc44(N=k | F) < \u221e.\n\nNow by linearity of expectation,\n\n\ud835\udd3c_\ud835\udc44[N | F] = \u03a3_{i=1}^{\u221e} \ud835\udc44(H_i=1 | F).\n\nIf every term in that sum were \u2265 \u03b5 for some \u03b5>0, the expected value would diverge.  For the sum to converge, the individual terms must converge to 0; indeed, permutation invariance forces them all to be equal, so they must all equal 0.  Hence \ud835\udc44(H_k=1 | F)=0 for every k.  In short, no permutation\u2010invariant regular conditional probability can preserve the \u00bd marginal once we have learnt F.\n\n5.  Why \u201cstick with \u00bd\u201d looks tempting\u2014and why it fails  \n\nThe view that one should not adjust away from \u00bd usually rests on two thoughts.\n\na.  Independence. Before learning F, you regarded your coin as independent of the rest.  Learning F does not reveal the outcome of any specific other flip, so (the reasoning goes) you have learned nothing germane to your own coin; independence ought to screen off F.\n\nb.  Zero\u2010probability events are epistemically negligible. Conditionalisation on measure\u20100 events is arbitrary; therefore rationality imposes no definite update here, so sticking with the prior \u00bd is at least permissible.\n\nBoth arguments falter under closer inspection.\n\nAd (a). Your coin is independent of each other individual coin, but it is not independent of the tail event F, nor even of the family of events F_n.  Indeed we computed above that \ud835\udc43(H_k=1 | F_n) < \u00bd for every n and that the conditional probability tends downward to 0.  The independence premises simply do not extend to the collective, highly non-local information supplied by F.\n\nAd (b). True, standard Kolmogorov conditional probabilities are undefined on measure-0 events, but in practice we repeatedly find ourselves updating on what the prior said had probability 0 (witness continuous\u2010valued observations in physics).  The usual resolution is to appeal to limits of conditional probabilities on positive\u2010measure sets that approximate the target event.  For your coin-tossing problem, every \u201creasonable\u201d approximating sequence that respects the qualitative content of F\u2014e.g. the sequence (F_n) used above, or any cofinal subsequence\u2014yields the same limit 0.  In that important sense the update is unambiguous.  Conversely, one can manufacture exotic approximations that force the limit to take other values (indeed any value between 0 and 1), but those sequences encode extraneous information, such as a special role for low-indexed coins, that is not embodied in the original description of F.  If one demands symmetry\u2014and almost every philosophical discussion of the case does\u2014credence 0 is the unique answer.\n\n6.  Existence and uniqueness of a regular conditional distribution  \n\nGiven a countably generated \u03c3-algebra and a \u03c3-finite measure, disintegrations (regular conditional probabilities) exist almost everywhere.  In our case the event F itself has probability 0, so one cannot appeal to an \u201ceverywhere\u201d result; nevertheless one can build a \u03c3-additive measure \ud835\udc44 on (\u03a9,\ud835\udd3d) that (i) is supported by F, (ii) is permutation-invariant, and (iii) agrees with the product measure on tail events mod F.  The Kolmogorov extension theorem ensures uniqueness of such a measure, and straightforward calculations then show \ud835\udc44(H_k=1)=0.  Hence, once we insist on countable additivity and symmetry, the conditional distribution is fixed and the credence in H_k drops to 0.\n\n7.  A cautionary note on finitely additive alternatives  \n\nSome writers (notably, proponents of de Finetti style finitely additive probabilities) have observed that one can concoct a finitely additive conditional on F for which each marginal remains \u00bd.  The trick is to sacrifice countable additivity: one assigns probability \u00bd to H_k=1 but assigns probability 0 to the disjoint union \u22c3_{k=1}^{\u221e} {H_k=1}, thereby avoiding any contradiction with the knowledge that only finitely many heads occur.  Whatever the merits of finitely additive probabilities in general, that manoeuvre buys stability of the \u00bd credence at the price of violating an axiom (countable additivity) that underpins virtually all mainstream Bayesian reasoning.  Since the original problem is posed in the ordinary Kolmogorov framework, appeal to purely finitely additive revisions looks more like an evasion than a solution.\n\n8.  Philosophical morals  \n\nThe coin\u2010room story is a vivid illustration of three broader lessons.\n\ni.  Global information can swamp local independence.  Even when individual variables are mutually independent, learning a non-local fact about the ensemble can dramatically affect your beliefs about each part; the present example is a limiting case.\n\nii.  Events of prior probability 0 are not epistemically inert.  Rational agents must sometimes condition on such events, and when they do, the correct update is fixed once symmetry and continuity constraints are imposed.\n\niii.  Infinite idealisations matter.  No finite analogue of the story produces the same reversal: in a room with N people you could never learn that \u201conly finitely many heads\u201d occurred, because that statement furnishes no new information.  The limit N \u2192 \u221e, however, changes the situation qualitatively.  Philosophers and scientists should be cautious when exporting finite\u2010case intuitions to countably infinite settings.\n\n9.  Conclusion  \n\nGiven the standard Bayesian norm of conditionalisation, augmented by the familiar device of limit conditioning and by the natural symmetry requirement that labelled coins be treated alike, the only coherent credence to adopt upon learning that only finitely many heads occurred is 0 (strictly: as close to 0 as one cares to make it, the limit being 0).  Retaining the prior value \u00bd is untenable, for it makes the expected number of heads infinite and flys in the face of every reasonable regularisation of conditional probability on F.  At the same time the example usefully reminds us how delicate conditional reasoning becomes in measure-zero contexts, and how care with infinite idealisations can upset the deliverances of na\u00efve intuition.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 5, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 6337, "reasoning_tokens": 3328}
{"question_id": "Builes-ParadoxEvidentialEquivalence-2020", "question": "Consider the following case: You are in a room with a countable infinity of people, and each of you flips a fair coin without looking at the result. You know that all the coin flips are fair and independent. You are then informed that something remarkable happened: only finitely many coins landed heads. What should your credence be that your coin landed heads? Should it remain at 1/2, or should it change? Provide arguments for your answer.", "answer": "What follows is a sustained attempt\u2014roughly two thousand words\u2014to work out, with some care, what rational credence you ought to assign to the proposition\n\nH: my own coin landed Heads\n\nonce you learn\n\nF: in the entire infinite collection only finitely many coins landed Heads.\n\nAt first pass the puzzle seems to pull us in opposite directions.  On the one hand it is hard to see how learning something about the other \u221e \u2212 1 coins could, by itself, make any difference to the intrinsic chance of my own flip; after all, the coins are stipulated to be fair and probabilistically independent.  That suggests that the correct posterior credence should still be \u00bd.  On the other hand, the content of F is qualitatively astonishing: among a countably infinite family of fair coin\u2013tosses we are told that only finitely many Heads occurred.  Intuitively that looks like an environment \u201coverwhelmingly saturated\u201d with Tails; and it is tempting to infer that the conditional probability of my being one of the rare Heads must be driven right down toward 0.  Which line of thought is correct?\n\nI.  Anatomy of the Temptation to Say \u201c~0\u201d\n\nLet us first rehearse, in its most compelling form, the argument for slashing the credence.\n\n1.  In the normal run of things, an \u03c9-sequence of fair independent flips almost surely contains infinitely many Heads (and infinitely many Tails).  Indeed the Strong Law of Large Numbers tells us that with probability 1 the limiting frequency of Heads is \u00bd.  The event F therefore has prior probability 0.  \n\n2.  Suppose nevertheless that F has somehow been verified.  Then, in the actual sequence, at most N coins\u2014not \u201cmost\u201d, just finitely many\u2014are Heads.  Each of the countably many persons is singled out by some fixed natural number i \u2208 \u03c9.  Out of those infinitely many indices only finitely many are indices of Heads.  \n\n3.  If a selector were to choose an index uniformly at random from \u03c9, the probability that it happened to pick one of the exceptional finitely many indices would be 0.  \n\n4.  I am one of the \u03c9 individuals.  So (it is urged) the probability that I inhabit one of those exceptional indices is likewise 0.  Consequently once F is learned, rational credence in H should collapse toward 0.\n\nWhat is wrong with this reasoning?  The crucial step is (3) \u2192 (4).  It slides, almost invisibly, from talk about an ad hoc random selector to talk about me, a concrete particular person\u2014whose index was fixed long before anyone knew what the flips would bring.  The move is illegitimate.  Notice what (3) really establishes: given F, the set of indices at which a Head occurs has (as mathematicians say) asymptotic density 0 inside \u03c9.  That implies that if an index were chosen by a mechanism that is independent of the outcome of the flips and is equiprobable over the natural numbers, the conditional probability that the chosen index is one of the rare Head-indices would be 0.  But that tells us nothing at all about the status of any specific, antecedently identified index.  Independence matters.  The device that selects an index uniformly at random is, by hypothesis, probabilistically unrelated to the coin outcomes; by contrast, the index that picks me out is hard-wired and may well be probabilistically correlated with the outcome once F is fixed.  Indeed, as we shall see, it is extremely correlated: if it happens to be the index of a Head in the actual \u03c9-sequence, then given F there will be exactly N \u2212 1 Heads among the others; if it is not, there will be N among the others.  The selector analogy therefore proves too much.\n\nThe moral: talk of \u201cbecoming a random member of a reference class\u201d is perilous in probability problems involving infinite populations.  If the class is infinite but the target set is only finite, the probability that a uniformly selected random member falls in the target will indeed be 0, but no contradiction arises from the fact that someone\u2014or even you\u2014does fall there.  What remains is to supply a strictly Bayesian analysis.\n\nII.  Conditioning on Probability-Zero Events: Some Measure-Theoretic Tools\n\nLearning F poses a technical difficulty: under the usual product measure on {H,T}^\u03c9 the event F has probability 0.  Na\u00efve Bayes\u2019 rule,\n\nP(H | F) = P(H \u2227 F)/P(F),\n\nis undefined.  There is, however, a well-developed theory of conditional probability vis-\u00e0-vis measure-zero events, built on two interlocking ideas:\n\na)  Conditional expectations with respect to \u03c3-algebras (Radon\u2013Nikodym derivatives).\n\nb)  Approximating the probability-zero event by a decreasing sequence of positive-probability events.\n\nThe route that best highlights the structure of our problem uses \u03c3-algebras.\n\nLet X\u2080 be the indicator of my coin: X\u2080 = 1 if H, 0 if T.  Let T be the tail \u03c3-algebra generated by the sequence (X\u2080, X\u2081, X\u2082, \u2026)\u2014i.e. the collection of events whose truth-value depends only on the flips beyond any given finite stage.  Kolmogorov\u2019s 0-1 Law tells us that every event in T has probability either 0 or 1; moreover, for any integrable random variable Y, the conditional expectation E(Y | T) is T-measurable and (because of independence of finite vs. tail events) collapses almost surely to E(Y): the tail \u03c3-algebra is independent of any finite patch of the sequence.\n\nNow, F\u2014the event that only finitely many Heads occur\u2014is plainly a tail event: deleting the first k flips cannot affect whether the whole sequence contains only finitely many Heads.  Accordingly, X\u2080 and F are independent.  Hence\n\nE( X\u2080 \u00b7 1_F ) = E(X\u2080) \u00b7 P(F) = \u00bd \u00d7 0 = 0.\n\nA direct consequence, supplied by standard theorems on regular conditional distributions, is that\n\nE[X\u2080 | F] = \u00bd\n\nP-almost everywhere on F.  Put more heuristically, \u201conce you know everything there is to know about how the flips go from stage N onward, you still have no further information about how the first flip went\u201d.  Conditionalizing on F, although epistemically dramatic, gives you no probabilistic leverage on X\u2080.  Your posterior credence should therefore remain equal to the prior, viz. \u00bd.\n\nIII.  A More Concrete Approximation Argument\n\nSome philosophers (and many students) remain uneasy with tail-\u03c3-algebra talk, finding it too abstract.  The same verdict can be reached by a limiting-events approach.  For n = 1,2,3,\u2026 let\n\nF_n : \u201cat most n coins landed Heads\u201d.\n\nEach F_n has positive probability, though of course that probability rapidly tends to 0.  Because the events are nested (F_{n+1} \u2286 F_n) and their intersection is F, we may examine\n\nP(H | F_n) = P(H \u2227 F_n)/P(F_n),\n\nand then pass to the limit as n \u2192 \u221e.  Employing independence of X\u2080 and the collection of other flips we get\n\nP(H \u2227 F_n) = \u00bd \u00b7 P(\u201camong the remaining flips there are at most n\u22121 Heads\u201d).\n\nCall that latter probability q_{n\u22121}.  Thus\n\nP(H | F_n) = (\u00bd q_{n\u22121}) / [\u00bd q_{n\u22121} + \u00bd q_n].\n\nBut q_{n\u22121} \u2265 q_n.  Dividing numerator and denominator by q_n we find\n\nP(H | F_n) = \u00bd \u00b7 (q_{n\u22121}/q_n) / [\u00bd (q_{n\u22121}/q_n) + \u00bd].\n\nObserving that q_{n\u22121}/q_n \u2192 1 as n\u2192\u221e, we obtain\n\nlim_{n\u2192\u221e} P(H | F_n) = \u00bd.\n\nTaking the limit delivers the same posterior \u00bd on F.  (Strictly speaking we also need to verify that the conditional probabilities converge in a suitable sense to define a regular version; standard measure-theoretic facts guarantee this.)  Again the moral is that the spectacular unlikelihood of F has no differential effect on whether X\u2080 is Heads or Tails.\n\nIV.  Why the Independence Intuition Wins\n\nWe may now restate, in plain English, why learning F does not reduce the credence below \u00bd.\n\n1.  Objective chance remains \u00bd.  The physical mechanism that produced my coin result was a fair, genuinely random process.  Nothing I later learn about the outcomes of other processes (even infinitely many of them) retroactively alters that objective chance.  David Lewis\u2019s Principal Principle enjoins us to match credence to chance except where we have so-called inadmissible information\u2014information about the actual outcome.  Learning F gives me ample information about what happened in the rest of the world but gives me no direct information about the outcome of my own local coin.  Thus, as long as we accept the Principal Principle, \u00bd is mandated.\n\n2.  Symmetry remains in force.  Before any information is released, the joint distribution is completely exchangeable; each person\u2019s coin is probabilistically indistinguishable from each other\u2019s.  The statement F singles out a property of the global ensemble, not of any particular individual.  Because of exchangeability, whatever conditional probability is rational for me must also be rational for each other person.  Yet the total number of Heads conditional on F is finite and (for the sake of argument) could be, say, exactly 17.  If everyone set their posterior credence equal to \u03b5 \u226a 1/2, then the expected number of Heads\u2014countably infinite copies of \u03b5\u2014would still be infinite, contradicting F.  The only way to reconcile exchangeability with the finite-Heads fact is for everyone\u2019s conditional probability to remain \u00bd.\n\n3.  The set-density intuition is a red herring.  It is perfectly consistent, under probability theory, that a countable set of indicators each independently take value 1 with probability \u00bd, and yet conditional on there being only finitely many 1\u2019s, the conditional probability for any specific indicator remains \u00bd.  Finitude of the total does not entail smallness of the conditional probability for any fixed co-ordinate.\n\nV.  Philosophical Morals\n\n     1.  The episode illustrates a limitation of informal \u201cproportional reasoning\u201d that treats infinite sets as though they carried a uniform probability measure.  The mistake was to assume that because the relative frequency of Heads within the infinite population sinks to 0, the chance of my being a Head must also sink to 0.  Relative frequency is not the same thing as probability when we talk about a single, predetermined member of an infinite ensemble.  (The same phenomenon occurs in standard measure theory: the set of rational numbers has Lebesgue measure 0 in [0,1], yet the conditional probability that \u00bd is rational, given that fact, is still 1.)\n\n     2.  Conditionalisation on probability-zero events is delicate but not incoherent.  Philosophers sometimes worry that Bayesianism cannot handle updates on events to which one originally assigned probability 0.  The present case shows that, at least when the probability model is countably additive and well-founded, perfectly unproblematic conditional probabilities can be defined; their uniqueness, however, hinges on regularity considerations stemming from the \u03c3-algebra.\n\n     3.  The problem is an instructive cousin of the famous \u201cparadox of the two aces\u201d and of Borel\u2019s paradox.  In each case evidential reports that are intuitively \u201cpurely about the rest of the world\u201d turn out, when analysed carefully, not to shift rational credence about a local variable.\n\nVI.  Objections and Replies\n\nObjection 1:  \u201cIndependence is broken once we condition on F.  X\u2080 may be independent of the tail \u03c3-algebra unconditionally, but conditional on F the variables are interdependent: knowing that lots of other coins were Tails makes it more likely that mine is a Tail.\u201d\n\nReply:  Yes, global independence fails on the conditioned probability space; what survives is conditional mean-independence.  Although X\u2080 and the infinite tail become negatively correlated on the restricted space, the expected value of X\u2080 given the tail remains \u00bd.  Correlation alone does not determine conditional expectation.\n\nObjection 2:  \u201cYour argument depends on abstract measure-theoretic niceties.  A coherent Bayesian who allows finitely additive probabilities could legitimately adopt a different regular conditional probability, driving P(H|F) to 0.\u201d\n\nReply:  True; if one weakens countable additivity, non-standard conditional probabilities proliferate.  But the puzzle was posed in ordinary mathematical language presupposing the classical, \u03c3-additive Kolmogorov framework.  Within that orthodox setting, the conditional chance is uniquely \u00bd.  Philosophers wary of countable additivity have long known that surrendering it comes at the price of non-uniqueness of conditional probabilities; deciding whether that price is worth paying is a deeper debate.\n\nObjection 3:  \u201cYet surely I gain evidence that my coin is Tail when I hear that only finitely many Heads occurred\u2014after all, if I peek and see Head, that would contradict my new knowledge that Heads are scarce.\u201d\n\nReply:  Seeing Head would not contradict F; it would merely reveal that you are one of the scarce cases.  That is entirely compatible with F.  Likewise seeing Tail would not confirm F in any special way.  Your personal observation, if eventually made, has zero impact on whether there are finitely or infinitely many Heads in the rest of the universe\u2014so no asymmetry of confirmational import arises.\n\nVII.  A Simple Analogy\n\nImagine an infinite deck of cards in perfectly random order, each card being either red or black with equal marginal probability.  You are dealt the 5th card.  You are then told that in the whole infinite deck there are only finitely many red cards.  Does that make it suddenly rational for you to believe that your own card is almost certainly black?  No: the 5th position in the deck was fixed in advance and had its color decided independently of the eventual global fact about finitude of reds.  The analogy is structurally identical to our coin story and reinforces the \u00bd verdict.\n\nVIII.  Conclusion\n\nA thorough Bayesian analysis vindicates the conservative answer: your credence that your own coin landed Heads should remain exactly \u00bd.  The powerful intuition that Heads have become \u201cexceptionally rare\u201d slides illicitly from a fact about the global distribution to a claim about a specific, antecedently singled-out case.  The underlying probability theory confirms that, within the classical Kolmogorov model endowed with countable additivity, conditioning on the (probability-zero) event F leaves the conditional expectation of any particular coin unchanged.  Philosophically, the episode highlights once more how easily reasoning by informal \u201cproportions\u201d in infinite settings can go astray, and how indispensable the technical machinery of modern probability is to adjudicating such puzzles.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 6, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 4919, "reasoning_tokens": 1600}
{"question_id": "Builes-ParadoxEvidentialEquivalence-2020", "question": "Consider the following case: You are in a room with a countable infinity of people, and each of you flips a fair coin without looking at the result. You know that all the coin flips are fair and independent. You are then informed that something remarkable happened: only finitely many coins landed heads. What should your credence be that your coin landed heads? Should it remain at 1/2, or should it change? Provide arguments for your answer.", "answer": "Only finitely many heads!  As soon as the announcement is made every eye in the room turns, first to the ceiling\u2014as if it might explain what has just occurred\u2014and then inward, to the question that concerns each of us:  given this astonishing information, how likely is it that my own coin came up heads?  The natural thought is \u201cone chance in two \u2013 the coin is still fair.\u201d  A contrary thought is that the announcement ties the outcomes together in such a way that almost certainly I must be one of the infinitely many people who got tails.  Which thought is right?\n\nThe difficulty of the case is not mathematical trickery; it is that the announcement is itself a probability\u2013zero event.  In a room in which countably many independent fair coins are tossed, the probability that only finitely many of them land heads is exactly 0.  A standard Bayesian agent is therefore being asked to update on something to which she assigned no prior probability at all, and orthodox conditionalisation (Pnew(A) = Pold(A & E)/Pold(E)) is silent because the denominator is 0.  To see what the rational response ought to be we therefore have to reflect, not merely calculate, and think hard about what considerations should govern learning from \u201cimpossible\u201d information.\n\nThe discussion will proceed in four stages.  (1) I explain why the probability of finitely many heads is 0 and why that undermines automatic appeal to ordinary conditionalisation.  (2) I show, by a sequence\u2013of\u2013approximations argument, that any reasonable regularisation of conditionalisation drives the posterior probability of your own head toward 0.  (3) I address a tempting independence-based argument for retaining \u00bd and show why it fails once we recognise that independence does not survive conditioning.  (4) I consider residual philosophical worries\u2014about physical independence, Dutch books, the reflection principle, and the epistemology of zero-probability events\u2014and argue that they either militate in favour of the \u201czero\u201d answer or at least leave it unscathed.  I conclude that the rational credence that your coin landed heads, given the announcement, is 0.\n\n1\u2003Why the new information is a probability-zero event  \nFor each natural number n let Hn be the event that the nth coin lands heads.  The Strong Law of Large Numbers tells us that, with probability 1, the frequency of heads in an infinite sequence of independent fair coin flips converges to \u00bd.  The Borel\u2013Cantelli Lemma strengthens the point: with probability 1, infinitely many of the Hn occur.  Consequently the complementary event\n\n\u2003F = {only finitely many Hn occur}\n\nhas measure 0.  Yet F is certainly logically possible; it pinpoints a non-empty set of infinite sequences (all tails after some finite point).  So we face the classic Bayesian predicament: we have learned something which our probability measure deemed effectively impossible.  What is the rational way to incorporate that informational earthquake?\n\n2\u2003Regularising conditionalisation  \nOne standard manoeuvre is regularisation: approximate the impossible event by a sequence of possible events whose probabilities tend to 0, update in the usual way on each member of the sequence, and take a limit.  Different ways of approximating can in principle deliver different limits, so one must argue that a particular scheme captures the epistemic content of the information received.  In our case there is a uniquely natural approximation:\n\n\u2003FN = {at most N heads are tossed in total}.\n\nThe \u03c3-algebra generated by these FN\u2019s converges downward to F, and \u201conly finitely many heads\u201d can be understood as the idealised limit of successively stronger finite caps.\n\nSuppose there are M + 1 people in the room, labelled 0,1,2,\u2026,M, and you are person 0.  (Later we shall let M \u2192 \u221e.)  Let HM be the event \u201cperson 0\u2019s coin is heads\u201d and SN be the event \u201camong persons 1 through M there are at most N heads.\u201d  Conditional on FN, HM is equivalent to \u201cmy coin is heads and the other M coins have \u2264 N\u20131 heads.\u201d  Elementary combinatorics gives\n\n\u2003P(HM & SN) = \u00bd \u00b7 P(SN with \u2264 N\u20131)\n\u2003P(FN) = \u00bd \u00b7 P(SN) + \u00bd \u00b7 P(SN with \u2264 N\u20131).\n\nA quick calculation for any fixed finite N shows that\n\n\u2003P(HM | FN) = P(HM & FN)/P(FN) \u2264 N/(M + 1).\n\n(The intuitive derivation is even simpler: if total heads \u2264 N then at most N of the M + 1 coins can be heads, so by symmetry each individual coin has probability \u2264 N/(M + 1) of being one of them.)\n\nNow let M \u2192 \u221e, reflecting the fact that we started with countably many other agents.  For every fixed N,\n\n\u2003limM\u2192\u221e P(HM | FN) \u2264 limM\u2192\u221e N/(M + 1) = 0.\n\nFinally, take N \u2192 \u221e so that FN \u2198 F.  By a standard continuity argument for nested conditioning, any limit point of P(H | FN) as N \u2192 \u221e must itself be \u2264 0, whence it is exactly 0.\n\nThe key point is that the ordering of the limits (first M to infinity, then N) exactly mirrors the announcement.  We were told, of a genuinely infinite population already in place, that the number of heads is finite but unspecified; hence cap N is allowed to grow but the population size is not to shrink.\n\nCould some different regularisation yield \u00bd instead?  Only if we perversely held fixed a finite population, updated on \u201c\u2264 N heads,\u201d and let N grow before letting the population itself tend to infinity.  But that second order of limits does not capture what we have been told.  In the real announcement the room is already infinite and nothing was said about how large the finite bound on heads is.  The regularisation that flows from the content of the information inexorably delivers posterior credence 0.\n\n3\u2003Why independence does not salvage the \u00bd answer  \nA common objection is:  \u201cMy coin was tossed by a physically fair mechanism which is causally and prob\u00adabil\u00adis\u00ad tically independent of the other tosses.  Learning how the others came out therefore tells me nothing about mine, so my credence should remain \u00bd.\u201d  The objection confuses unconditional with conditional independence.  Unconditionally the tosses are independent; conditionally on \u2018at most N heads in total\u2019 they are decidedly not.  The event provides a global constraint that generates massive negative correlations: the more heads elsewhere, the less room there is for yours.\n\nThe point is familiar from finite analogues.  If two coins are independent but I am later told that at most one of them landed heads, each alone is no longer a fair coin relative to my epistemic state; indeed, P(first is heads | \u2264 1 head) = P(second is heads | \u2264 1 head) = \u00bd\u00b7(\u00bd)/[\u00bd\u00b7(\u00be)] < \u00bd.  Nothing causal has changed, yet rational credence must change because I have learned a logically constraining fact.  The infinite case is simply the limit of these finite cases, and the constraint becomes so stringent that the posterior drops all the way to 0.\n\n4\u2003Philosophical reconciliation  \n\n4.1\u2003Dutch-book considerations  \nImagine a bookie who, immediately after the announcement, offers every person a \\$1 ticket that pays out iff that person\u2019s own coin shows heads, selling each ticket for 50 cents.  If every agent sticks with credence \u00bd each will regard the bet as fair.  Yet ex ante the bookie is guaranteed to pay out on only finitely many tickets while collecting an infinite total of 50-cent fees\u2014yielding sure profit unbounded above.  The group as a whole is, in effect, weakly lured into a collective Dutch book.  That is a strong pragmatic sign that the individual credence \u00bd is globally incoherent once the new information is on the table.  By contrast, if each agent\u2019s credence drops to 0 no one will buy and the bookie cannot exploit them.\n\n4.2\u2003Reflection and dynamic consistency  \nYou might object that before the coins were tossed you were confident that your future-self, even if told strange things, would continue to believe the coin fair.  So by van Fraassen\u2019s Reflection Principle should you not stick at \u00bd now?  The premise fails: before the toss you placed probability 0 on learning that only finitely many heads were tossed.  Reflection applies only to events to which you assign positive probability.  Since this condition is violated, Reflection is silent, and retaining \u00bd is not required for dynamic consistency.\n\n4.3\u2003Physical independence and causal scruples  \nAnother worry is that treating my coin as essentially certain to be tails feels \u201cspooky,\u201d as though facts about infinitely many distant coin flips were causally influencing a local event.  The reply is that the influence is purely epistemic.  You have not changed your view about the causal structure of the world; you have merely come to learn that you are in a very special world, one whose global configuration virtually guarantees that any randomly selected coin is almost surely tails.  Learning global statistical constraints rationally changes local expectations without postulating new forces.  (Compare: learning that there are only a hundred albinos in the world makes it rationally nearly certain that a randomly chosen person is not an albino even though pigmentation genes remain causally independent across individuals.)\n\n4.4\u2003Learning from probability-zero events  \nCan one ever rationally learn from something that had prior probability 0?  Orthodox Kolmogorov probability theory gives no general recipe but nothing prohibits extended Bayesian schemas.  Richard Jeffrey\u2019s \u201cradical probabilism\u201d and Bas van Fraassen\u2019s \u201cconditionalisation on becoming certain\u201d both allow credence revision toward 0 or 1 when faced with zero-measure evidence, provided the update is generated by an appropriate limiting procedure.  The appropriateness, in turn, is judged by whether the limiting conditional probabilities track the informational content of the evidence.  In our case they do; the 0-answer is therefore squarely in the spirit of sophisticated Bayesian epistemology.\n\n5\u2003Summing up  \nWe were told something that is both astonishing and, by our own lights, probabilistically impossible.  The information is epistemically potent because it tightly couples outcomes that were previously independent, producing overwhelming negative correlation.  A principled regularisation of Bayesian conditionalisation shows that, under that coupling, the chance that any particular coin\u2014including yours\u2014landed heads must sink to 0.  Independence arguments fail because they ignore the conditional structure; Dutch-book, reflection, and causal considerations either support or at least do not undermine the 0-verdict.\n\nAccordingly, upon learning that only finitely many coins landed heads, rational credence that one\u2019s own coin landed heads should fall from \u00bd to 0.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 7, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 5674, "reasoning_tokens": 3264}

Provide arguments for your answer.", "answer": "Learning that only finitely many heads were tossed in a countably\u2010infinite sequence of fair, independent coin flips is epistemically explosive.  The information you acquire is logically compatible with the original measure on outcomes, yet it sits in the very far recesses of that measure: it is an event to which the original probability is not merely tiny but exactly zero.  Because ordinary Bayesian conditionalisation is defined only for positive\u2010probability events, there is no automatic, uncontroversial recipe for updating on it.  That observation already suggests that reasonable people might differ about what one \u201cought\u201d to believe after hearing the news.  Still, there is a natural, deeply rooted tradition\u2014 stretching from Borel through de Finetti to modern treatments of regular conditional probability\u2014according to which your posterior credence that your own coin landed heads should plunge not to \u00bd but to 0.  In what follows I shall:\n\n1.  Set out the intuitive tension between the \u201cindependence therefore \u00bd\u201d thought and the \u201cfinitely many heads therefore almost certainly tails\u201d thought.  \n2.  Show formally why, under any exchangeable and countably additive extension of the ordinary coin\u2010toss measure, the second thought wins: the conditional probability has to be 0.  \n3.  Explain why the independence argument is fallacious once one takes conditionalisation seriously.  \n4.  Discuss alternative updating schemes (Popper functions, Lewis\u2019s imaging, etc.) and show why they either reproduce the 0 answer or make the posterior indeterminate.  \n5.  Close with philosophical reflections on what the case teaches us about learning from zero\u2010probability information.\n\nBecause the question asks what \u201cyour credence should be,\u201d I take our target to be a rational degree of belief rather than a purely mathematical conditional probability.  My claim is that, given the background of orthodox Kolmogorov probability and a broadly Bayesian attitude to updating, the rational credence is 0.\n\n1.  A clash of intuitions  \n\n   1.1  The independence intuition.  \n   Each individual coin is fair and the flips are mutually independent.  Learning about other coins, one might think, does not affect the chances for yours.  Formally:\n\n      P(H\u2080 = 1) = \u00bd,    \n      P(H\u2080 = 1 \u2227 FinitelyManyHeads) = ?\n\n   If H\u2080 is independent of the global event F (call it F), then\n\n      P(H\u2080 = 1 \u2227 F) = \u00bd\u00b7P(F),\n\n   whence Bayesian conditionalisation would yield \u00bd again.  So, by the simplest application of \u201cindependence is forever,\u201d your credence stays at \u00bd.\n\n   1.2  The finitude intuition.  \n   On the other hand, to say that only finitely many heads occurred among countably many flips is to say that almost every coin, indeed all but finitely many coins, came up tails.  If almost every coin is tails, why should you expect yours to be one of the privileged finitely many heads?  The natural reaction is that the chance must be 0, or at any rate exceedingly small.\n\nWe have a standoff, apparently produced by two equally compelling probabilistic principles.  To resolve it we must get more precise.\n\n2.  The formal argument for a posterior of 0  \n\n   2.1  Exchangeability.  \n   The prior probability distribution is perfectly symmetric: relabelling the coins cannot affect probabilities.  In technical terms the sequence (H\u2080, H\u2081, H\u2082, \u2026) is exchangeable.  Exchangeability survives conditionalisation provided the condition itself is permutation\u2010invariant.  Our condition F\u2014\u201conly finitely many heads in total\u201d\u2014is obviously permutation\u2010invariant.  Hence whatever posterior we adopt, it must still treat the coins symmetrically.  That is,\n\n      For every n,   P(H\u2099 = 1 | F) = p\n\n   for some common value p between 0 and 1.\n\n   2.2  Countable additivity.  \n   Write N for the (possibly infinite) number of heads.  Because the indicators H\u2099 are pairwise disjoint events of the form \u201ccoin n is the first head\u201d etc., countable additivity implies\n\n      E[N | F] = \u03a3\u2099 P(H\u2099 = 1 | F) = \u03a3\u2099 p.\n\n   Now F is the event that N is finite.  Consequently N is almost surely finite under the posterior, and hence its expected value E[N | F] must be finite as well.  The only way an infinite sum of identical non\u2010negative summands can be finite is if each summand is 0.  Therefore\n\n      p = 0.\n\n   So symmetry plus countable additivity force\n\n      P(H\u2080 = 1 | F) = 0.\n\n   There is no wiggle room; any exchangeable, countably additive posterior gives that answer.\n\n   This argument is due in spirit to de Finetti (1931) and appears in modern textbooks under \u201cthe zero\u2013one law for individual coordinates given tail events.\u201d\n\n3.  What went wrong with the independence intuition?  \n\n   3.1  Independence is not preserved under conditioning.  \n   Your coin is indeed independent, in the prior, of each finite subcollection of the others.  But it is not independent of a tail event\u2014an event that depends on the infinite future of the sequence.  A quick check:\n\n      Prior:   P(F) = 0 (as the strong law of large numbers entails infinitely many heads with probability 1).\n\n      Counterfactual:   P(F | H\u2080 = 1) versus P(F | H\u2080 = 0).\n\n   Intuitively, if you are told in advance that coin 0 landed heads, that makes it harder (never mind how much) for the totality of coins to end up with only finitely many heads; one head has already been \u201cused up.\u201d  So H\u2080 and F cannot be independent.  Because the event F itself had prior probability 0, the ordinary factorisation proofs of independence never even get off the ground.\n\n   3.2  Conditional dependence is commonplace.  \n   Elementary examples abound.  Two fair dice are independent.  Condition on their sum\u2019s being 12, and they become perfectly correlated.  The present case is exactly the same pattern, except that \u201csum = 12\u201d degrades to \u201cfinitely many heads,\u201d an event of prior probability 0.  Once one appreciates that independence can evaporate under conditioning, the intuitive basis for staying at \u00bd collapses.\n\n4.  Alternative updating methods  \n\n   4.1  Popper\u2010Renyi conditional probability.  \n   Several philosophers (notably Haj\u00e9k and others) urge that rational credence be represented not by a single Kolmogorov function but by a Popper function or a Renyi conditional probability, which assigns primitives of the form P(A | B) for every B, including B of measure zero.  On the canonical construction for an exchangeable sequence of coin flips, the Popper conditional coincides with the argument in section 2, so again one gets 0.\n\n   4.2  Lewis\u2019s imaging.  \n   Suppose, more unconventionally, that upon learning F you \u201cshift\u201d each possible world to the most similar F\u2010world (David Lewis\u2019s imaging).  Because any heads\u2010world has to be moved to a tails\u2010world for all but finitely many coins, and because similarity is normally taken to preserve coin identities, the image of a world in which H\u2080 = 1 will usually be a world in which H\u2080 = 0.  Though models differ, the typical outcome once more credits 0 to H\u2080.\n\n   4.3  Indeterminate credences.  \n   Joyce, Levi, and others allow that, when conditioning on measure\u2010zero information, rationality may leave you with a set of permissible posteriors rather than a sharp one.  Even on that permissivist approach, however, \u00bd is hard to sustain.  Any posterior retaining the fair probability \u00bd for a single coin must, by symmetry, confer infinite expectation on N, in flat conflict with F.  Hence the set of permissible posteriors will contain only distributions driving P(H\u2080 = 1) all the way to 0.\n\n5.  Philosophical morals  \n\n   5.1  Learning the improbable.  \n   The case dramatises how a rational agent can coherently \u201clearn the impossible.\u201d  Before you opened your ears the hypothesis \u201conly finitely many heads\u201d had credence 0.  Yet epistemic life goes on once you accept it.  What must give is the idea that conditionalisation rules alone settle every posterior; updates on zero events require a supplementary norm (e.g. \u201cchoose a regular conditional\u201d, \u201cextend by exchangeable Popper function\u201d, etc.).  Given almost any such norm, however, the posterior for your own coin is 0, not \u00bd.\n\n   5.2  Dependence without causation.  \n   Nothing causal connects your coin to the infinitely many others.  Nevertheless they become probabilistically dependent after the new evidence arrives.  Philosophers sometimes assimilate probabilistic dependence to causal influence, but the present example shows how misleading that assimilation can be.\n\n   5.3  The power\u2014and limits\u2014of symmetry.  \n   At an intuitive level, symmetry pulled both ways.  One symmetry consideration said \u201cmy coin is no different from any other; since at most finitely many are heads, almost surely mine is tails.\u201d  Another said \u201cmy coin is no different now from before, so its probability remains \u00bd.\u201d  The formal analysis vindicates the first and exposes the second as resting on an illicit transfer of independence across the conditioning boundary.  In short, symmetry coupled with countable additivity is a potent argument, but one must deploy exactly the right symmetry: permutation of *labels* survives the update; independence generally does not.\n\n   5.4  Countable versus finite additivity.  \n   One way to rescue a \u00bd answer is to abandon countable additivity in favour of merely finite additivity.  De Finetti himself was open to that route.  If one drops \u03c3\u2010additivity, the proof in section 2 fails.  Yet finite additivity courts paradoxes (Banach\u2010Tarski\u2010style) and has never won wide acceptance as a rational standard.  Moreover, there remain finitely additive representations that still give 0.  So the appeal to finite additivity saves \u00bd only at the cost of deep theoretical revision.\n\nConclusion  \n\nA careful examination of the probabilistic structure shows that the remarkable announcement\u2014that only finitely many of a countably infinite family of independent, fair coins came up heads\u2014demands a radical update.  Once we condition on that zero\u2010probability tail event, exchangeability and countable additivity force the posterior probability that any particular coin was one of the few heads to drop to zero.  The superficial independence argument for retaining \u00bd falters because independence is not preserved under conditioning, least of all conditioning on an event of prior measure zero.  Alternative formalisms\u2014Popper functions, Lewisian imaging, sets of credences\u2014either reproduce the 0 verdict or withhold a determinate answer; none vindicate a steadfast \u00bd unless they depart in dramatic ways from the mainstream probabilistic norms.  Hence, on the most orthodox Bayesian analysis available, your rational credence that your own coin landed heads should not stay at \u00bd; it should be 0.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 8, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 3898, "reasoning_tokens": 1408}

Philosophers and probabilists are divided.  One reflex reaction is: \u201cMy coin is fair, it has a physical chance of \u00bd, and nothing I have learned concerns its micro\u2010state, so my credence should stay \u00bd.\u201d  An opposite, equally reflexive reaction is: \u201cAmong an infinity of people, only finitely many were lucky enough to see heads; the chance that I\u2014picked at random from the room\u2014am one of this privileged finite group is effectively zero; so my credence in heads should plummet to 0.\u201d  These two instincts pull in opposite directions, and the tension reveals deep issues about conditional probability, regularity, independence, and the relation between objective chance and epistemic probability.  I shall argue that the second instinct is correct: once you learn that only finitely many heads occurred, rational credence in the proposition \u201cmy coin landed heads\u201d should be 0.  But I shall also explain why this answer is compatible with the coin\u2019s objective \u00bd chance, why the symmetry of the situation does not force a \u00bd credence, and why the result does not impugn the usual maxim that \u201cindependent evidence never bears on independent events.\u201d\n\n1.  Setting the stage: the measure\u2010zero update  \n\nLet \u03a9 be the set of all infinite sequences of H (heads) and T (tails) indexed by the natural numbers 1,2,3,\u2026, and let P be the usual product measure that makes the coordinates i.i.d. with P(H)=P(T)=\u00bd.  For person i the outcome of her coin is the i-th coordinate.  The event F we are told about is\n\u2003F = {\u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9 : only finitely many coordinates equal H}.\nBecause the probability that a fair coin lands heads is \u00bd, the strong law of large numbers entails that with P\u2010probability 1 the limiting relative frequency of heads is \u00bd, so almost surely infinitely many heads occur.  Hence P(F)=0.  We are therefore asked to condition on a measure\u2010zero event.  The usual Bayes formula\n\u2003P(A|F)=P(A\u2227F)/P(F)\nis undefined.  One must therefore appeal to the more sophisticated concept of a regular conditional probability\u2014a conditional distribution P(\u00b7|F) that assigns probabilities to events given F in a way that (roughly) respects countable additivity and agrees with Bayes on events of positive measure.  The bad news is that regular conditionals are not unique on null events.  The good news is that, in this particular problem, symmetry and the Kolmogorov extension theorem do single out a natural candidate, and it sets P(\u201cmy coin is heads\u201d | F)=0.\n\n2.  Why the \u201csymmetry\u201d argument for \u00bd fails  \n\nA first thought is that since all coins are probabilistically identical, whatever credence I assign to my own coin should also be assigned to every other person\u2019s coin.  So if I assign \u00bd to mine, I must assign \u00bd to each.  But then, summing expected numbers, I would expect infinitely many heads, contradicting the information that only finitely many heads occurred.  Something has to give.  The symmetry that matters after learning F is not \u201cevery coin is equally likely to be heads\u201d; rather, it is \u201cevery coin is equally likely to be one of the (now known to be) finitely many heads.\u201d  Because there are countably infinitely many coins but only finitely many heads, the probability that a given coin is among the heads must be 0.  The na\u00efve symmetry argument overlooks the impact that F has on the joint distribution: the coins are no longer independent conditional on F, and their marginals are no longer \u00bd.\n\n3.  An approximation argument with finitely many coins  \n\nSome philosophers distrust measure\u2010zero updates because uniqueness is not guaranteed.  One useful diagnostic is to approximate the infinite problem with a finite one on which ordinary conditioning works, then examine the limit.  Imagine first N people instead of countably many, and replace F by the event F_N that at most K_N heads occurred, where K_N = \u230a\u221aN\u230b.  For each fixed N, the event F_N has positive probability; hence conditional probabilities are unambiguous.  A brief calculation using hypergeometric distributions gives\n\u2003P(\u201cmy coin is heads\u201d | F_N) = E[#heads]/N = K_N/N = \u221aN/N = 1/\u221aN,\nfor large N (ignoring negligible terms).  As N grows, this conditional probability shrinks to 0.  Because the events F_N converge \u201cdownward\u201d to F and the conditional probabilities converge to 0, it is natural\u2014indeed forced by any reasonable regularity\u2010preserving scheme\u2014to set P(Head|F)=0 in the limit.\n\n4.  Exchangeability and de Finetti\u2019s theorem  \n\nAnother rigorous route uses exchangeability.  The family (X_1,X_2,\u2026) of coin indicators (1 for head, 0 for tail) is exchangeable under the original measure.  According to de Finetti, there is a latent random parameter \u0398, distributed Beta(1,1) (i.e. uniform on [0,1]), such that conditional on \u0398 the X_i are i.i.d. Bernoulli(\u0398).  Under the original measure, \u0398 almost surely equals \u00bd (for the product measure), so the representation degenerates, but we can still use the idea heuristically: learning F tells us that the limiting frequency of heads is 0.  So, in every sequence compatible with F, the empirical average (1/n)\u03a3_{i\u2264n}X_i tends to 0.  By exchangeability, for any fixed i we have\n\u2003P(X_i = 1 | F) = lim_{n\u2192\u221e} E[(1/n)\u03a3_{j\u2264n}X_j | F] = lim_{n\u2192\u221e} 0 = 0.\nThus the conditional probability is 0.  Put another way, in any exchangeable model, if the total number of successes is finite almost surely, the probability that a randomly chosen index is a success is 0.\n\n5.  Independence after conditioning  \n\nA common objection is: \u201cHow can information about the other coins affect mine when all tosses were independent?\u201d  The answer: independence is fragile; it does not in general survive conditioning.  Two events A and B that are independent under P can become dependent once we restrict attention to an event F that correlates them.  The classical Borel paradox makes the same point: latitude and longitude of a random point on a sphere are independent, but if you are told the point lies on (say) the north\u2013south axis\u2014a probability\u20100 set\u2014then latitude and longitude are perfectly correlated.  Likewise here: the event F essentially says, \u201cThe vast majority of coins landed tails,\u201d which introduces a strong negative correlation among coin outcomes.  Given F, the fact that almost every other coin is tail is evidence that yours is too.\n\n6.  Objective chance versus epistemic probability  \n\nIsn\u2019t the objective chance that the coin lands heads still \u00bd?  Yes.  Nothing in the physics of the tosses has changed.  But epistemic probability tracks rational degrees of belief in light of one\u2019s total evidence, not propensities per se.  Suppose you learn from a reliable oracle that a particular fair coin toss resulted in tails.  The objective chance of heads was \u00bd, but your credence in heads should now be 0.  Evidence always trumps prior chances.  The present case is more subtle only because the evidence concerns the entire ensemble rather than the single toss, and because it has probability 0 given your prior.  But those facts do not insulate the toss from evidential impact.  The oracle\u2019s message \u201cfinitely many heads\u201d is logically compatible only with sequences in which your own toss is almost surely a tail.  Conditionals are sensitive to logical compatibility, not just to physical propensity.\n\n7.  Arbitrary re\u2010labeling and the principle of indifference  \n\nAnother way to see why \u00bd is untenable invokes a variant of the \u201cmantis shrimp\u201d trick familiar from discussions of self\u2010locating probability.  After hearing F, imagine you are blindfolded and randomly re\u2010assigned a seat number by a drum lottery that permutes the countable list of people.  Because the underlying product measure is invariant under finite or even countable permutations, your credence distribution after re\u2010labeling must coincide with your earlier one.  But the expected number of heads in the first million seats, conditional on F, is some finite number M.  Invariance requires that each seat have the same conditional probability q of being heads; hence M = q\u00b71,000,000.  Since M is finite but the number of seats tends to infinity, q must be 0.  This reasoning is a special case of a standard result in exchangeable probability called \u201cKingman\u2019s paintbox.\u201d\n\n8.  Non\u2010uniqueness of regular conditionals and why uniqueness is restored here  \n\nKolmogorov\u2019s axioms alone do not guarantee a unique conditional probability on null events.  In simple examples, one can write down different regular conditional distributions that disagree about P(A|F).  So a skeptic might claim that \u00bd is an equally legitimate conditional as 0.  However, additional natural constraints do pin things down.  One such constraint is \u201cconsistency under finite approximations\u201d: any candidate conditional should be the limit of ordinary conditionals on a decreasing sequence of positive\u2010measure events that approximate F.  The K_N approximation in \u00a73 yields the limit 0, not \u00bd.  A second constraint is \u201cpermutation invariance\u201d: there is no fact of the matter about which labels 1,2,3,\u2026 attach to which people, so any admissible conditional must commute with all finite permutations of indices.  It can be proved (and has been, e.g. by Berti, Pratelli & Rigo, 2007) that under such constraints the conditional is unique, and in the present case assigns probability 0 to any fixed coin being heads.\n\n9.  Practical Bayesianism: how a finite Bayesian would reason  \n\nImagine a colossal but finite Bayesian who, before learning F, assigns the standard product\u2010measure prior to an explicit cutoff N = 10^{100}.  She learns that at most one million heads have occurred.  Ordinary Bayesian updating then gives her posterior credence in \u201cmy coin is heads\u201d as \u226410^{6}/10^{100}=10^{-94}.  The posterior is therefore extremely low, not \u00bd.  If she now declares herself willing to raise her cutoff\u2014\u201cI was never committed to N=10^{100}; I can allow any finite N\u201d\u2014then in the limit as N\u2192\u221e her posterior tends to 0.  That limiting posterior is precisely the regular conditional we have identified.\n\n10.  Philosophical morals  \n\na.  Evidence about the global configuration of an infinite system can rationally alter beliefs about a local component, even when the physical chances remain fixed.  Objectivity of chance and independence are not sufficient for doxastic inertia.  \nb.  Conditioning on measure\u2010zero events is coherent provided one supplements Kolmogorov with reasonable regularity constraints.  In the present case, those constraints lead unambiguously to the 0 answer.  \nc.  The case illustrates the subtlety of the Principle of Indifference.  If you apply it na\u00efvely\u2014\u201cI have no reason to favor heads over tails\u201d\u2014you get \u00bd.  But once you incorporate all your information, you do have a reason: it is massively more plausible that you are one of the countably infinite tails than one of the rare heads.  \nd.  The reasoning generalizes: whenever you are one member of an infinite exchangeable population and you learn that only finitely many members satisfy a certain property, your credence that you yourself satisfy it must be 0.\n\n11.  Replies to three objections  \n\nObjection 1: \u201cThe update makes me certain my coin is tails, yet I acknowledge a \u00bd chance in the physical sense.  Isn\u2019t that inconsistent?\u201d  \nReply: No.  The two statements concern different modalities.  You are certain, epistemically, that you are in the tails subset of the actual world, but you concede that in the space of nomologically possible worlds, roughly half the worlds have your coin head.  Certainty about actuality coexists with modal uncertainty.\n\nObjection 2: \u201cIf my credence is 0, I would pay an arbitrarily large finite sum for a bet that pays only \\$1 if my coin is tails.  But that seems absurd.\u201d  \nReply: The bet hypothetical is misleading.  Two things you would almost surely do after learning F are (i) refuse any stake, however small, that pays \\$1 on heads, and (ii) accept any stake, however large and finite, that pays \\$1 on tails.  Given the information you possess, that is perfectly coherent: the event that costs you money has conditional probability 0.  The scenario is not incoherent; it is just extreme.\n\nObjection 3: \u201cBut couldn\u2019t a different regular conditional, maybe one that exploits non\u2010measurable pathologies, give \u00bd?\u201d  \nReply: Yes in principle, no in practice.  Without additional constraints Kolmogorov does not fix a unique conditional.  But Bayesianism typically presupposes some normative principles beyond mere sigma\u2010additivity: e.g. approximate consistency, permutation invariance, and countable supervenience on one\u2019s credences about finite sub\u2010algebras.  Under any such principle the 0 answer emerges.  The \u00bd proposal survives only by rejecting those very principles and embracing non\u2010measurable constructions that have no empirical or decision\u2010theoretic justification.\n\n12.  Summation  \n\nThe question poses an apparent paradox: how can new information about events elsewhere in an independent system affect your belief about the outcome of your own fair coin?  The resolution is that while independence holds unconditionally, it is destroyed by conditioning on the global, highly informative event F.  Any regular approach to conditional probability\u2014whether via finite approximations, exchangeability, or invariance\u2014makes your posterior credence in heads collapse from \u00bd to 0.  Far from violating probability theory, this collapse is demanded by it once one recognizes that (i) F is a probability\u20100 event, (ii) conditional independence generally fails on such events, and (iii) symmetry requires that the few heads in F be spread so thinly across the countably infinite population that the chance of being one of them is null.

At first sight there are two natural reactions.\n\nA.  Independence:  \u201cMy coin is fair and independent of the others; nothing I have learned makes it more or less likely to be heads.  My credence should stay at \u00bd.\u201d\n\nB.  Scarcity:  \u201cI now know there are only finitely many heads spread over countably many coins.  That makes the proportion of heads zero.  The chance that my particular coin is one of the rare heads must therefore be 0.\u201d\n\nThe puzzle, then, is to decide whether (A) or (B) is the correct response\u2014or whether something has gone wrong in the way the question is framed.  I shall argue for (B): after learning that only finitely many heads were tossed, a rational agent should assign credence 0 to her own coin\u2019s landing heads.  On the way to that conclusion I will\n\n1.  make precise the mathematical framework;\n2.  explain why naively appealing to independence is a fallacy once one conditions on an event of probability 0;\n3.  construct a regular conditional probability that delivers credence 0 and show why no rival construction can deliver \u00bd without violating standard Bayesian norms; and\n4.  reflect on the philosophical morals for learning from \u201cmeasure-zero\u201d information.\n\n1.  The probabilistic set-up  \n\nLet \u03a9 be the product space {H, T}^{\u2115}.  Write X_n(\u03c9) = 1 if the n-th coin in outcome \u03c9 is heads, 0 otherwise, and let P be the usual product measure generated by independent fair coins (so P(X_n = 1) = \u00bd and the X_n are mutually independent).  Put  \n\nF  := {\u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9 : \u03a3_{n=1}^{\u221e} X_n(\u03c9) is finite}.\n\nClassic results\u2014Kolmogorov\u2019s 0\u20131 law or the second Borel-Cantelli lemma\u2014tell us that P(F) = 0.  Indeed, with probability 1 there are infinitely many heads and infinitely many tails.\n\nWe have therefore been told that an event of probability 0 happened.  If one insists on a purely frequentist construal of \u201cchance,\u201d that very announcement looks incoherent; but Bayesian epistemology, decision theory, and modern statistics all allow conditioning on measure-zero events via regular conditional probabilities.  The question becomes what conditional probability P(X_0 = 1 | F) ought to be taken to mean and what value it should receive.\n\n2.  Why \u201cindependence\u201d stops just where the puzzle starts  \n\nThe first impulse is to invoke independence.  The trouble is that independence is formulated for unconditional probabilities.  The proposition \u201cX_0 is independent of F\u201d means  \n\nP(X_0 = 1 \u2227 F) = P(X_0 = 1)\u00b7P(F).\n\nBoth sides of that equation are 0, so independence obtains trivially.  But it does not follow that  \n\nP(X_0 = 1 | F) = P(X_0 = 1).\n\nWhenever P(F) > 0, independence guarantees that equality; when P(F)=0 the conditional probability is not defined by the usual ratio and further work is needed.  To see why the intuitive independence argument fails, consider a simpler finite illustration.\n\nFinite analogy.  Two fair coins are tossed.  Let E be the event \u201cthe two coins differ.\u201d  E has probability \u00bd.  Condition on E.  Given E, the coins are perfectly anticorrelated, not independent: P(first is heads | E) = \u00bd but P(first is heads \u2227 second is heads | E) = 0.  Merely learning that E holds destroys independence, even though each coin\u2019s toss was physically independent.  In our infinite case, learning F will likewise create correlations; we cannot assume that X_0 retains its prior probability.\n\n3.  Constructing a regular conditional distribution  \n\nBayesians need a principled way to update on F.  Kolmogorov\u2019s theory supplies one: for every \u03c3-algebra \u2131 there exists (on nice spaces such as \u03a9) a regular conditional probability P(\u00b7 | \u2131).  Taking \u2131 = \u03c3(F), we seek a probability measure Q_F such that for any event A in \u03a9,  \n\n(i)   Q_F(A) is a measurable function of \u03c9 constant on F and on F\u1d9c,  \n(ii)  \u222b_F Q_F(A) dP = P(A \u2227 F).\n\nBecause P(F)=0, (ii) does not pin down a unique value of Q_F(A) on F; but additional symmetries of the underlying probability space often single out a \u201cnatural\u201d conditional.  That is what happens here.\n\nShift invariance.  Let S be the left-shift operator on \u03a9: (S\u03c9)_n = \u03c9_{n+1}.  P is S-invariant.  Furthermore, F is shift invariant; if \u03c9 has only finitely many heads, so does S\u03c9, and vice-versa.  A standard ergodic-theoretic argument shows that any regular conditional measure Q_F that preserves the shift symmetry among coordinates must assign probability 0 to X_0 = 1.  Sketch:\n\n1.  For each n, let H_n be {\u03c9 : X_n(\u03c9)=1}.  Because of shift symmetry, Q_F(H_n) must take the same value for every n.  Call that value r.\n\n2.  The expected number of heads under Q_F is then \u03a3_{n=1}^{\u221e} r, which is 0 if r=0 and infinite otherwise.\n\n3.  But by definition of Q_F, that expected number must be finite\u2014F entails finitely many heads.  The only way to reconcile finitude with countable additivity is to have r=0.\n\nThus symmetry alone drives us to r = 0.  More concretely, one can approximate F by the increasing family of finite events F_k = {at most k heads}.  For each k, the ordinary conditional probability\n\nP_k(X_0 = 1) := P(X_0 = 1 | F_k)\n\ncan be calculated explicitly:\n\nLet S_{\u22600} be the sum of heads among the other coins.  Then\n\nP_k(X_0=1 \u2227 F_k) = \u00bd \u00b7 P(S_{\u22600} \u2264 k-1),  \nP(F_k)           = \u00bd \u00b7 P(S_{\u22600} \u2264 k) + \u00bd \u00b7 P(S_{\u22600} \u2264 k-1).\n\nHence\n\nP_k(X_0=1) = P(S_{\u22600} \u2264 k-1) / [P(S_{\u22600} \u2264 k) + P(S_{\u22600} \u2264 k-1)].\n\nNow P(S_{\u22600} \u2264 m) \u2192 0 as m\u2192\u221e (with an astronomically fast super-exponential rate).  The numerator and denominator both go to 0, but the numerator does so at least as fast as the denominator, driving the ratio to 0.  Taking the limit along this canonical approximating sequence gives Q_F(H_0)=0.\n\nAny attempt to obtain \u00bd must therefore abandon either shift invariance or countable additivity.  The first step would be ad hoc\u2014why privilege one person over another?  The second would be a radical departure from classical Bayesianism.  Absent such departures, credence 0 is forced.\n\n4.  Objections answered  \n\na)  \u201cBut someone\u2019s coin did come up heads\u201d  \n\nIt is tempting to reason: F is compatible with, say, exactly 7 heads.  Conditional on exactly 7 heads, the expected number of heads is 7, so the average conditional probability across coins is 7/\u03c9(\u221e) = 0.  No contradiction.  Indeed, under Q_F, the event \u201csome coin is heads\u201d has probability 1, while each individual coin\u2019s probability of being heads is 0.  That is not paradoxical; it is simply an instance of countable additivity in an infinite space.\n\nb)  \u201cMy coin was designated in advance\u2014doesn\u2019t that matter?\u201d  \n\nYes, and it is the reason the answer is 0 rather than something like \u201cundefined.\u201d  If one were to pick a coin uniformly at random from among the infinitely many people, the very idea of \u201cuniformly at random\u201d breaks down; different regularizations would lead to different answers.  Because the problem fixes a particular person (you), we can use the symmetry argument above.   \n\nc)  \u201cDoesn\u2019t conditionalization on probability-zero events undercut Bayesian methodology?\u201d  \n\nNo.  A regular conditional probability is as canonical and well-behaved as the ordinary ratio definition when the conditioning event has positive measure.  The seeming pathology comes from our intuitions, honed on finite cases, not from the mathematics.  Moreover, in decision theory we often do need to update on what, ex ante, was thought virtually impossible (Black Swan events).  Doing so coherently requires the very machinery deployed here.\n\n5.  Philosophical upshot  \n\n(i)  Independence is fragile.  Physical independence of data-generating processes does not generally survive epistemic conditioning.\n\n(ii)  Scarcity beats symmetry when there is an infinite population.  Even though every coin has the same prior properties, the global information that heads are scarce makes it rational to believe almost surely any given coin is tails.\n\n(iii)  Measure-zero learning is coherent\u2014so long as one follows the formal rules.  In finite probability theory, the formula P(A | B) = P(A \u2227 B)/P(B) suffices.  In the infinite setting, one needs the full apparatus of regular conditional probabilities plus the symmetries of the problem to pin down the right posterior.\n\n(iv)  Infinite additivity matters.  Someone might protest that it is strange for every individual probability to be 0 while the probability that \u201csomebody got heads\u201d is 1.  But that consequence flows straight from countable additivity, a foundational axiom of Kolmogorovian probability.  Abandoning that axiom creates far more problems than it solves.\n\n(v)  Practical moral.  Suppose an experimenter announces an outcome that, according to your prior, had probability 0.  You can still update rationally; but you must beware of implicit independence assumptions.  A shift in the global pattern of data can drastically change the evidential relevance of local facts.\n\n6.  Conclusion  \n\nUnder the standard Bayesian conception of rational belief, augmented by the theory of regular conditional probabilities and guided by the symmetries of the infinite product measure, the credence that your own coin landed heads, given that only finitely many coins did, should be 0, not \u00bd.  The intuition that \u201cnothing has changed about my coin\u201d overlooks the fact that the very meaning of \u201cindependent\u201d changes once one incorporates global information of measure-zero probability.  Far from revealing a flaw in Bayesian reasoning, the puzzle illustrates its subtlety and strength: when the impossible becomes actual, the rational agent can still learn, and the content of that learning can be mathematically\u2014and philosophically\u2014precise.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 10, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 4484, "reasoning_tokens": 2048}

I end by drawing a moral about the limits of purely probabilistic reasoning in infinitary, self-locating cases.\n\n1.  Formal set-up  \n\nLet \u03a9 be the set of sequences \u03c9 = (\u03c9\u2081,\u03c9\u2082,\u2026) with \u03c9\u1d62 \u2208 {H,T}.  Equip \u03a9 with the usual product \u03c3-algebra and the fair product measure P under which the coordinates (X\u2081,X\u2082,\u2026) are IID Bernoulli(\u00bd).  Let\n\nE  = {\u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9 :  #{i : \u03c9\u1d62 = H} < \u221e }.\n\nE says \u201conly finitely many heads occur.\u201d  For each n \u2208 \u2115 define\n\nE_n = {\u03c9 :    #{i \u2264 n : \u03c9\u1d62 = H}  \u2264 n  and  \u03c9\u1d62 = T  for all i > n }.\n\nE_n is the event that after time n every toss is tails.  E is the union of countably many events of this type:\n\nE = \u22c3_{m=0}^\u221e  {\u03c9 : there exists N such that  #{i\u2264N : \u03c9\u1d62 = H} = m  and \u03c9\u1d62 = T for i>N} \n    = \u22c3_{N=0}^\u221e  E_N.\n\nEvery E_N has probability 0 (because the chances that the sequence eventually \u201clocks in\u201d are zero), hence P(E)=0.\n\nOur question: given the information E, what should\n\nP*(H\u2081)  =  P(X\u2081 = H  |  E)\n\nbe?  (H\u2081 abbreviates {\u03c9 : \u03c9\u2081=H}.)  The problem is that P(\u00b7|E) is undefined in orthodox probability theory.\n\n2.  Why ordinary conditionalisation fails  \n\nBayes\u2019 rule tells us\n          P(A|E) = P(A\u2229E) / P(E),\nprovided P(E) \u2260 0.  Since P(E)=0, the ratio 0/0 is not defined.  Mathematicians handle such cases with \u201cregular conditional probabilities\u201d (RCPs).  An RCP is a \u03c3-additive family of measures {P_E(\u00b7)}_E defined on a sub-\u03c3-algebra such that, for measurable F,   P(F\u2229E) = \u222b_E  P_E(F)  dP.  But RCPs are only unique up to P-null sets.  As soon as a conditioning event itself is P-null, nothing in Kolmogorov\u2019s axioms pins down a single conditional distribution.  In our case there are in fact many RCPs compatible with the product measure; some make P_E(H\u2081)=\u00bd, some make it 0, and some make it any value between.  That is the mathematical reflection of a philosophical freedom: before we say what our new credence should be we must choose an updating principle that resolves the indeterminacy.\n\n3.  Two prominent philosophical principles  \n\n3.1  Symmetry\u2010based updating\u2014stay at \u00bd  \n\nOne influential idea, descended from de Finetti and van Fraassen, is that an agent who learns a tailor-made, measure-zero proposition should take a limit of \u201cnearby\u201d positive\u2010probability propositions.  The most straightforward family to use are the events\n\nF_k  = {\u03c9 : #{i\u2264k : \u03c9\u1d62 = H} < \u221e }.\n\nNote that F_k has probability 1 (there are only finitely many tosses up to time k), so P(H\u2081|F_k)=\u00bd by plain independence.  If one lets k\u2192\u221e, the sequence F_k tends downwards to the tail \u03c3-algebra event E.  By \u2217continuity of conditional probabilities\u2217 one thereby obtains\n\nlim_{k\u2192\u221e} P(H\u2081 | F_k) = \u00bd.\n\nThis conclusion is buttressed by the following symmetry\u2010argument: (i) each coin is exchangeable, (ii) the fact that \u201conly finitely many heads occur\u201d is permutation-invariant, and (iii) under an exchangeable prior, symmetry demands identical posteriors for each coordinate.  If every coin must have the same conditional distribution and the total number of heads is finite, that distribution cannot be 0 (all tails) or 1 (all heads); the only candidate is \u00bd itself.  In effect, the new information concerns the global pattern of the sequence and, by invariance, does not single out coin 1 in any special way.  Many philosophers take this to show that one\u2019s credence should remain \u00bd.\n\n3.2  Typical-member updating\u2014go to 0  \n\nA different line of thought takes as basic the idea that \u201cI am one member of a countably infinite population but did not receive any label entitling me to special treatment.\u201d  Given E, there are only finitely many heads.  If I regard myself as a randomly selected (self\u2010locating) observer from the population, the chance that I am one of those finitely many special individuals appears to be 0.  A vivid way to see this is to let H be the set of people whose coin showed heads.  Under E, H is finite, the complement H^c is infinite, and the natural density of H within the people is 0.  So by the Principal Principle connecting objective chances with rational credence, the right posterior for my coin is 0 (or at least \u201carbitrarily close to 0\u201d).\n\nFormalising this intuition, one constructs a different approximating family of events.  Let\n\nG_m = {\u03c9 : #{i : \u03c9\u1d62 = H} \u2264 m }.\n\nFor each m, both the numerator and denominator of P(H\u2081|G_m) are positive (though tiny).  Because of exchangeability,\n         P(H\u2081 & G_m) = 2^{-1} P(G_{m-1}),\nwhile\n         P(G_m)      =       P(G_m).\n\nHence\n         P(H\u2081 | G_m) =  (\u00bd) P(G_{m-1}) / P(G_m).\n\nAs m\u2192\u221e the ratio P(G_{m-1}) / P(G_m) tends to 0 (intuitively: requiring one fewer head is a negligible tightening of a probability\u20100 constraint), so the conditional probability goes to 0.  One can also use martingale theory: the fraction of heads after n tosses is a martingale that almost surely converges to \u00bd, but upon conditioning on the event that the limiting average is 0, the martingale collapses to 0 at every finite stage.  That gives a rigorous conditional probability making P_E(H\u2081)=0.  (Technically, one is choosing an RCP that transforms the sequence of IID Bernoulli(\u00bd) variables into IID Bernoulli(0) variables.)\n\nAdvocates of typical-member updating further note that some decision\u2010theoretic recommendations support the 0 verdict.  Suppose everyone who got heads will be executed unless at least one of them happens to draw a joker from an infinite deck.  Before learning E your chances of being executed are \u00bd.  After learning \u201conly finitely many heads\u201d, the expected number of condemned persons is finite, but the number of safe persons is infinite; your personal chance of being in danger therefore vanishes to 0 (javian-characteristic \u201cdilution\u201d).  Action-guidance lines up with the 0 answer.\n\n4.  Weighing the arguments  \n\n4.1  Independence is a red herring.  The datum E is not independent of my coin; indeed H\u2081 \u2282 E\u0304  implies dependence.  So the mere fact that X\u2081\u2019s outcome was settled by an independent physical process does not guarantee that its conditional distribution stays the same.  That point favours the typical-member camp, at least insofar as it undercuts the simplest objection to any change of credence.\n\n4.2  Exchangeability does not decide the issue.  True, every coin is exchangeable, but an exchangeable prior may have multiple exchangeable RCPs on E.  The \u00bd-updaters choose one, the 0-updaters another.  Symmetry itself therefore underdetermines the answer; one needs tie-breakers such as \u201cpreserve marginal probabilities when possible\u201d (favouring \u00bd) or \u201capply anthropic typicality\u201d (favouring 0).\n\n4.3  Handling of self-locating belief.  If one thinks the problem is essentially anthropic\u2014\u201cwhat are the odds that I am one of the remarkable few?\u201d\u2014the typical-member perspective seems tailor-made.  But if one insists that person 1 is objectively singled out (I know I am agent #1), self-location is no longer modal; then the symmetry that links me to the other agents is broken, and the force of the dilution argument weakens.  The two camps tacitly adopt different attitudes toward personal indexicals.\n\n4.4  Decision theoretic tests.  Suppose you may sell a ticket paying \u00a31 if your coin shows heads; what price is coherent given E?  Under the \u00bd rule you value the ticket at 50p.  But imagine the social pool of all such tickets were bought by an outside bookmaker.  Knowing E, the bookmaker can be sure that he will have to pay out only finitely many pounds while he collects infinitely many 50p premiums, guaranteeing infinite profit.  Agents following the \u00bd rule would be collectively exploitable.  Typical-member updating removes the Dutch book\u2014each ticket is deemed worthless\u2014so collective coherence considerations point toward 0.\n\n4.5  Compatibility with alternative probability axioms.  Jeffrey conditionalisation, imaging, or Kullback-Leibler projection can each be extended to measure-zero updates.  Minimal\u2010information projection (a.k.a. \u201centropic updating\u201d) would choose the posterior that minimises KL-divergence subject to E; that posterior forces every coin to be tails almost surely, thereby yielding credence 0.  By contrast \u201ccentered\u201d Radon\u2013Nikodym RCPs (as used in Bayes nets) give credence \u00bd.  Which meta-principle is more fundamental is, of course, open to debate.\n\n5.  A tentative verdict and a moral  \n\nThe case exhibits a genuine underdetermination: orthodox probability theory plus the bare descriptive set\u2010up do not single out a unique posterior.  You must import an extra updating norm.  If you treat yourself as a fixed, labelled subject you have weak reason to preserve the \u00bd prior; if you count yourself as a randomly sampled member of an actually infinite population\u2014and if you accept minimal-information updating or anthropic typicality\u2014your credence rationally plummets to 0.  Because the story as told in the problem statement is silent about whether I am \u201cperson #1\u201d or merely \u201csomebody in the room\u201d, I judge the second interpretation the more natural and therefore conclude:\n\nAfter hearing that only finitely many heads were tossed, one ought to adopt credence 0 that one\u2019s own coin landed heads.\n\nBut I also recognise that the rival \u00bd verdict can be justified by a different, equally coherent modelling choice.  The lesson is that rationality constraints inside Kolmogorov probability do not always fix a unique answer in measure-zero, self-locating problems; philosophical work is required to choose an updating principle, and the choice can reflect deep commitments about identity, symmetry, and typicality.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 11, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 3839, "reasoning_tokens": 1152}

Three paths to a posterior of 0  \n\n2.1  Limiting approximations  \n\nFix k \u2208 \u2115 and consider, for each finite N > k, the event  \n\u2003F_{k,N} := \u201camong the first N coins, at most k are heads\u2019\u2019.  \nFor every finite N, P(F_{k,N}) > 0, so ordinary conditioning works.  Let H\u2081 be as before.  An elementary combinatorial calculation yields  \n\nP_N(H\u2081 | F_{k,N})  \n  = [\u03a3_{h=0}^{k-1} (N-1 choose h)] / [\u03a3_{h=0}^{k} (N  choose h)].  \n\nSince (N-1 choose h) / (N  choose h) = (N-h)/N, the numerator is at most k/N times the denominator.  Hence  \n\n0 \u2264 P_N(H\u2081 | F_{k,N}) \u2264 k/N.  \n\nLet N \u2192 \u221e while k is held fixed; then k/N \u2192 0.  Now let k range over \u2115 and note that F = \u22c3_{k} \u22c2_{N\u2265k} F_{k,N}.  Taking a suitable double limit (or employing a standard Daniell\u2013Kolmogorov RCP construction) gives  \n\nP(H\u2081 | F) = lim_{k\u2192\u221e} lim_{N\u2192\u221e} P_N(H\u2081 | F_{k,N}) = 0.  \n\nIn short: for any finite upper bound k on the number of heads in a sufficiently large initial segment, your chance of being one of those heads is at most k/N; as the segment grows without bound, that chance tends to 0.\n\n2.2  Regular conditional probability  \n\nMeasure theory assures us that for exchangeable product measures on countably infinite sequences there exists an RCP: a measurable function \u03c9 \u21a6 P(\u2022|E)(\u03c9) that behaves, for P-almost every \u03c9, like an ordinary conditional distribution even when P(E)=0.  If we use de Finetti\u2019s representation, the product measure can be viewed as a mixture of Bernoulli(\u03b8) distributions with respect to the Beta(1,1) (i.e. uniform) prior on \u03b8.  The event F corresponds to \u03b8 = 0: only if the limiting frequency of heads were 0 could there be at most finitely many heads.  Given F, the posterior on \u03b8 collapses to a point mass at 0, and conditional on \u03b8=0 every \u03c9\u2099 is almost surely T.  The RCP therefore assigns  \n\nP(H\u2081 | F) = 0.  \n\n2.3  Infinitesimal probabilities  \n\nSome Bayesians prefer to model \u201cprobability-0 but possible\u2019\u2019 events by enriching the real unit interval with infinitesimals (e.g. via a hyperreal field).  One spreads the initial fair measure to give F a positive infinitesimal weight \u03b5.  Because the construction is again symmetric, the mass of worlds in which both F and H\u2081 occur is of order \u03b5\u00b70: the joint event \u201cF and H\u2081\u2019\u2019 inherits an even smaller infinitesimal weight, for the same combinatorial reasons as under 2.1.  Dividing infinitesimal by infinitesimal, one finds that the ratio is 0 in the standard part.  Thus even on a non-Archimedean implementation the posterior is infinitesimally close to 0.\n\nAll three frameworks\u2014limiting, RCP, infinitesimal\u2014converge on the verdict that, once you learn F, you should be virtually certain that your coin came up tails.\n\n3.  Why independence does not freeze the prior at \u00bd  \n\nA natural objection is that your toss was statistically independent of all the others; therefore, knowledge about them should not influence the probability of your own result.  The objection trades on an ambiguity:  \n\nUnconditional independence:  P(H\u2081 \u2227 G) = P(H\u2081)\u00b7P(G) for every G generated by the other flips.  This indeed holds.  \n\nConditional independence:  For all G, P(H\u2081|G) = P(H\u2081).  This is false in general.  \n\nIf the objection were sound, no evidence about other flips\u2014no matter how specific\u2014could ever shift your credence about your own flip.  But consider the finite analogue: two coins are tossed independently and fairly; you learn that at most one landed heads.  Now the results are negatively correlated, and P(\u201cmy coin is heads\u2019\u2019 | \u201cat most one head\u2019\u2019) = \u00bd\u00b70 + \u00bd\u00b71 / (\u00be) = \u2153 < \u00bd.  Independence is not preserved under conditioning on relational information.  Likewise, in the infinite case, conditioning on F introduces massive negative correlation among the flips, driving the conditional chance of H\u2081 down to 0.\n\nThe moral is that independence is a statement about the joint prior, not a guarantee that all conditional distributions remain factorised after updating on evidence that links the variables.\n\n4.  Two philosophical worries addressed  \n\n4.1  Self-location and the \u2018random observer\u2019  \n\nOne might argue that although only finitely many heads occurred, you have no reason to think you are not one of them; after all, from the inside each person is subjectively indistinguishable.  Were we allowed to impose a uniform distribution over which agent you are, symmetry would push P(H\u2081|F) back to \u00bd.  But there is no countably additive uniform distribution over \u2115.  Any probability measure absolutely continuous with respect to counting measure assigns 0 to every individual index.  Once we are told that only finitely many indices carry the property H, the measure of belonging to that finite subset is 0.  The same conclusion follows from anthropic \u2018random-assignment\u2019 considerations standardly used in infinite Sleeping Beauty variants.  Symmetry is respected; it simply fails to yield a non-zero probability of landing in a finite cell of an infinite partition.\n\n4.2  Reflection and \u2018unforeseen evidence\u2019  \n\nHow can Bayesian epistemology require you to move to credence 0 in an event you originally thought had probability \u00bd, when you also assigned probability 0 to ever receiving the evidence F?  Won\u2019t the Reflection principle forbid this shift on pain of dynamic incoherence?\n\nThe short answer is that Reflection applies only to updates on events to which you assigned positive probability (de Separated by a row of blank lines to avoid misinterpretation   Finetti\u2019s \u201cprobability 0 does not mean impossibility\u2019\u2019 slogan notwithstanding).  In standard Dutch-book arguments, learning a probability-0 event is modelled by an ideal limit of probability-\u03b5 events.  You were not, and could not rationally have been, certain about what credence you would adopt conditional on a datum you deemed impossible\u2010to\u2010happen; so Reflection is silent.\n\nA longer answer draws on recent work by Rescorla, Steele, and others on dilations and nonmeasurable updates.  The prescription \u201cposterior = appropriate regular conditional probability\u2019\u2019 maximises expected epistemic utility subject to the total evidence norm.  Failing to update to 0 would expose you to accuracy dominance: by your own lights, any other agent whose posteriors coincide with the RCP beats you in squared-error expectation.\n\n5.  Summation  \n\n1.  In the canonical Kolmogorov model, the event F has ex ante probability 0, so orthodox conditionalisation is silent.  \n2.  Every reputable extension of conditionalisation\u2014limit processes, regular conditional probabilities, or infinitesimal enrichments\u2014yields P(H\u2081|F)=0.  \n3.  The independence of coin flips does not survive once we condition on F, since F is a global constraint that couples the variables.  \n4.  Attempts to revive a \u00bd credence by appeal to self-location or Reflection lose their force in countably infinite settings where uniform priors are unattainable and probability-0 evidence is epistemically disruptive.  \n\nTherefore: Having learned that only finitely many of the countably many coins landed heads, you should rationally adopt (practically) unit confidence that your own coin came up tails.  Your credence in \u201cmy coin is heads\u2019\u2019 ought to drop from \u00bd to 0 (or, in a non-Archimedean rendition, to an infinitesimal), notwithstanding the coins\u2019 fairness and independence.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 12, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 3242, "reasoning_tokens": 960}

Provide arguments for your answer.", "answer": "Finitely Many Heads: What Ought You to Think About Your Own Toss?  \n\n1. The puzzle  \n\nImagine being one person in a countably infinite crowd.  Each of you, in perfect synchrony, tosses a fair coin and hides the result.  A trustworthy loud-speaker then announces an astonishing fact:  \n\n\u2003(F)  \u201cOnly finitely many of the coins just tossed landed heads.\u201d  \n\nIf the process were really ideal\u2014independent tosses with \u00bd chance of heads each\u2014statement (F) describes an event that standard probability theory assigns probability 0.  Nevertheless you are told it is true.  How, if at all, should that alter your degree of belief that your own coin shows heads?  Two answers have seemed tempting:  \n\nA. \u201cNothing has changed: by symmetry my credence stays at \u00bd.\u201d  \n\nB. \u201cSomething dramatic has changed: after all, almost everyone must have tossed tails, so my credence should plummet toward 0.\u201d  \n\nThe question forces us to confront a family of delicate issues about Bayesian conditionalisation when the evidence learned has probability 0, about the role of symmetry in infinite settings, and about what counts as a \u2018natural\u2019 way to conditionalise in the first place.  I shall defend a qualified version of answer B: although one can consistently hold on to the old \u00bd in a purely formal sense, any regular method of conditionalising that respects the structure of the information received drives your credence for heads as close to 0 as you please.  There is therefore a compelling epistemic pressure to revise downward.  But the route by which we reach that verdict reveals why the case stirs up much deeper worries about conditioning on measure-zero events.\n\n2. Intuitive pull in opposite directions  \n\nStart with the pull toward \u00bd.  Before hearing (F) every participant is epistemically on a par; the outcome of one\u2019s own toss is independent of all the others; so the rational prior credence for \u2018my coin is heads\u2019 is \u00bd.  The announcement of (F) singles out no particular individual, mentions no particular subset of tosses, and preserves full permutation symmetry among people; so (one might think) whatever credence is appropriate for one of us must be appropriate for all.  If everyone is symmetric and not everybody can simultaneously lower their chance of having tossed heads below \u00bd (for probabilities must sum to the expected number of heads), perhaps the credence must stay at \u00bd.\n\nThe pull the other way is equally strong.  Learn that only finitely many heads were tossed.  Being told that is tantamount to being told that all but finitely many of the infinitely many people tossed tails.  If you have no reason to suspect you belong to the tiny \u2018heads elite\u2019, shouldn\u2019t you conclude that almost certainly you are among the overwhelming majority who tossed tails?  Frequency and typicality considerations appear to demand that your posterior credence in heads shrink to (at most) an infinitesimal level.\n\nThose two lines of thought cannot both be right; sorting out which survives careful scrutiny forces us to grapple with the mathematics of probability zero.\n\n3. Conditionalising on events of probability zero  \n\nLet \u03a9 be the product space {H, T}^\u2115 with the standard product \u03c3-algebra and the fair-coin product measure \u03bc.  Define  \n\n\u2003F  =  {\u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9 : the set of coordinates i with \u03c9\u208d\u1d62\u208e = H is finite}.  \n\nBy the strong law of large numbers, \u03bc(F) = 0.  Classical Bayesian conditionalisation is defined, for events of non-zero probability, by  \n\n\u2003P(A | B) = P(A \u2227 B) / P(B).  \n\nWhen P(B) = 0 the ratio is undefined.  Kolmogorov\u2019s theory offers a partial remedy: for any \u03c3-algebra \ud835\udd3e, one can usually define a regular conditional probability P(\u2219 | \ud835\udd3e), a measurable function giving conditional probabilities relative to every element of \ud835\udd3e, with the property that for \ud835\udd3e-measurable B of positive measure, P(A | \ud835\udd3e)(\u03c9) equals the usual ratio.  But where \ud835\udd3e is generated by a single event like F, nothing in the measure theory selects a unique value for P(\u2018my coin is heads\u2019 | F).  Infinitely many regular conditional probabilities are compatible with the job description.  Hence from a purely formal standpoint both \u00bd and 0 (indeed any number between them) can be made to occupy the slot \u201cposterior probability given F\u201d.\n\nPut bluntly: the mathematics refuses to adjudicate.  Philosophy must decide what, for an ideally rational agent, is the principled way to conditionalise in such a situation.\n\n4. Why the natural regular conditionals drive the probability to 0  \n\nA standard Bayesian way to define a conditional probability for a probability-zero proposition is by approximation.  Pick a decreasing sequence of positive-probability events F\u2081 \u2287 F\u2082 \u2287 \u2026 that converge to F and set  \n\n\u2003P*(A | F) := lim\u2099\u2193\u221e P(A | F\u2099)  \n\nprovided the limit exists and is independent of the approximating sequence (or else restrict attention to \u2018natural\u2019 approximations).  When we carry that programme out for our case, every obvious approximation pushes the credence for heads down to 0.  Two illustrations:\n\nApproximation (i): \u2018At most N heads in total\u2019.  \nLet  \n\n\u2003F_N  = {\u03c9 : at most N coordinates are heads}.  \n\nEach F_N has positive measure (in fact extremely tiny but non-zero).  By symmetry, conditional on F_N each of the first N+1 people has the same chance of being among the at-most-N heads.  Hence  \n\n\u2003P(H\u2081 | F_N) = N/(N+1)\u00b70  +  1/(N+1)\u00b71  = 1/(N+1).\n\nAs N\u2192\u221e, P(H\u2081 | F_N)\u21920.  The information that finitely many heads occur turns into the limit of ever stricter finite-head bounds, and the posterior probability goes to 0.\n\nApproximation (ii): \u2018The frequency of heads among the first M tosses falls below 1/M\u2019.  \nLet\n\n\u2003G_M  = {\u03c9 : number of heads among first M coins \u2264 \u221aM}.  \n\n(\u221aM is still much smaller than M/2, so the event asserts an uncharacteristically low head count in the initial segment.)  \nConditional on G_M, computation shows  \n\n\u2003P(H\u2081 | G_M) \u2264 \u221aM / M = 1/\u221aM ,\n\nagain tending to 0.\n\nNo matter which familiar finite-information way one encodes the content \u2018only finitely many heads\u2019, your credence that your own coin is heads is squeezed toward 0.\n\n5. Could any regular conditional keep the probability at \u00bd?  \n\nYes\u2014in principle.  Consider the following pathological construction.  Partition F into two pieces: F_H where the first coin is heads, F_T where it is tails.  Put a uniform prior over those two sets (this is possible because a measure-zero set may be assigned any conditional probabilities one pleases, subject only to measurability constraints).  That artificial choice yields P(H\u2081 | F) = \u00bd.  Nothing in Kolmogorov\u2019s axioms forbids it.\n\nThe question, however, is not whether such a conditional can be manufactured, but whether an epistemic agent should adopt it on learning F.  To earn that normative status, a conditional distribution ought to result from a credible epistemic process, one that satisfies the following desiderata:\n\n   (i) Sensitivity: if different finite data about other participants had been announced, the procedure would have delivered the correct orthodox result.  \n   (ii) Continuity: learning ever stronger finite information that implies F should drive the posterior toward the F-conditional distribution.  \n   (iii) Symmetry: the probabilities assigned should respect the remnant symmetries of the problem.\n\nThe \u00bd-valued conditional cannot meet (ii).  Any finite announcement that aproximates F\u2014say \u2018there are no heads beyond number 10,000\u2019\u2014would push the posterior for heads on toss 1 below 1/10 001.  Jumping from those small numbers all the way up to \u00bd at the limit breaks continuity violently.  By contrast, the 0-conditional respects (ii) automatically.  It also satisfies (i) and (iii).  Hence, from the standpoint of a plausible epistemic updating rule, 0 stands out as the uniquely reasonable value.\n\n6. The frequency argument made precise  \n\nAnother route, closer to the intuitive \u201cvast majority tail\u201d thought, exploits exchangeability.  Conditional on F, let K(\u03c9) be the (finite) number of heads.  Given K = k the heads\u2019 locations are k sites chosen uniformly at random from \u2115.  Because each individual site has probability 0 of being selected in an infinite uniform random subset of size k, P(site 1 \u2208 Heads | K = k) = 0 for every k.  By the law of total probability,\n\n\u2003P(H\u2081 | F) = \u03a3\u2096 P(H\u2081 | K = k & F)\u00b7P(K = k | F) = 0.\n\nThis derivation avoids any limit, yet rests on the same idea: when only finitely many heads exist in an infinite sea of tails, picking an index at random has probability 0 of hitting a head.\n\n7. But what about symmetry among people?  \n\nDoesn\u2019t symmetry require everyone\u2019s posterior to be the same\u2014forcing the probability back up to \u00bd?  Yes, symmetry under permutations that fix F does require everyone\u2019s probability to be equal.  The argument above already honours that: each participant should adopt probability 0 of being heads.  Assigning 0 to everybody is perfectly symmetric; what symmetry forbids is assigning different positive numbers to different people.  The hidden false premise in the earlier \u2018symmetry therefore \u00bd\u2019 line of reasoning is the tacit assumption that the sum of the individuals\u2019 probabilities of heads must still equal the expected number of heads.  That ceases to be true once one allows zero probabilities: 0 \u00d7 \u2135\u2080 is indeterminate; an infinity of zeros can perfectly well coexist with a finite expected number of heads.\n\n8. Philosophical morals  \n\nThe case dramatises three morals about Bayesian epistemology in infinite contexts.\n\nFirst, conditionalisation on probability-zero events is genuinely under-determined by classical probability theory.  One must supplement the formalism with a rule for choosing regular conditionals.  Taking limits of ordinary positive-probability updates is the most natural supplementation\u2014motivated by continuity with ordinary learning\u2014and in the present case that rule dictates a posterior arbitrarily close to 0.\n\nSecond, infinite idealisations can create information that swamps prior considerations.  Learning that only finitely many heads occurred is so informative that it all but rules out your having tossed heads yourself.  That does not contradict the independence of your coin; independence does not survive once one conditions on a global constraint tying all tosses together.\n\nThird, the problem warns that apparently innocent symmetry considerations can mislead when combined with infinity.  The intuition that \u201cif everyone assigns probability p to an event that occurs exactly k times, then \u03a3p = k\u201d tacitly slides from finite to infinite sums.  In the infinite case the total expectation can remain finite even if each individual assignation is 0.  The right lesson is not that symmetry fails, but that we must handle symmetry with care.\n\n9. Objections and replies  \n\nObjection (Self-location): \u201cEven if only finitely many heads occurred, I might be one of them.  Lacking evidence about which particular people form the heads set, why shouldn\u2019t I consider myself \u2018randomly sampled\u2019 from the infinite population, and hence with probability k/\u2135\u2080 = 0 of being a head?\u201d  \nReply:  That reasoning already leads to 0 and agrees with the analysis above.\n\nObjection (Lewisian centring): \u201cThe announcement doesn\u2019t give me any de se information\u2014nothing that singles me out as special\u2014so my self-locating credence for heads should remain at \u00bd.\u201d  \nReply:  On the contrary, the announcement is deeply about self-location: it tells you you belong to a world where almost everybody lands tails.  What it does not tell is whether you belong to the privileged few.  In the absence of a principle forcing equal credence across infinitely many epistemically possible selves, the natural limit procedure again pushes the probability down.\n\nObjection (Dutch book): \u201cIf you set your probability to 0 you expose yourself to a Dutch book: a bet that pays \\$1 if your coin is heads, costs any positive \u03b5 now, and reimburses you nothing otherwise looks favourable but loses you \\$1 with probability 0 not 0.\u201d  \nReply:  A bet that loses with probability 0 is not a sure loss in standard measure-theoretic gambling.  Dutch book arguments typically presuppose countable additivity and omit measure-zero events; they do not speak against assigning 0 conditional probability here.\n\n10. Conclusion  \n\nFormally, conditional probabilities given measure-zero evidence are not unique; but epistemically, once we adopt the widely accepted limiting procedure that connects learning probability-zero facts to learning more and more precise positive-probability facts, the answer is forced.  On being told that only finitely many coins landed heads, a rational agent should make their credence that their own coin landed heads as small as one wishes\u2014mathematically, 0.  \n\nThe path there is strewn with philosophical lessons: independence can be shattered by conditioning on global constraints; infinity instigates counter-intuitive gaps between individual and collective expectations; and Bayesianism requires extra principles, beyond Kolmogorov\u2019s axioms, to dictate how credences respond to measure-zero information.  Handle those principles with care, and the initially puzzling case ceases to be paradoxical: the astonishing news that the sea of coins produced only finitely many heads justifies an equally astonishing update\u2014your own coin is (almost certainly) a tail.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 13, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 4449, "reasoning_tokens": 1408}

The set-up\n\nImagine an \u03c9-sized row of agents, each about to toss a fair coin.  The coins are mutually independent and each lands Heads (H) with unconditional probability \u00bd.  Nothing in this specification privileges one agent over another; the sequence of outcomes is exchangeable.  After all tosses have been made (but before anyone has looked), an oracle announces:\n\n(\u2020)  \u201cOnly finitely many of the coins landed Heads.\u201d\n\nCall this event F.  By the strong law of large numbers, \u03bd(F)=0, where \u03bd is the usual product measure on infinite sequences of coin tosses; almost surely, the number of heads is infinite.  Nevertheless, in this imaginary story you are told that the probability-zero event F has occurred.  The philosophical puzzle is: once you hear (\u2020), what should your credence be that your own coin landed Heads?  Should it stay at \u00bd, or should it fall to 0?  Or does the very fact that F was probability-zero make the question ill-posed?\n\n2.  The temptation to stick with \u00bd\n\nA first reaction is to insist on independence:\n\n\u2022  The tosses were independent.\n\u2022  What the oracle told you concerns the other coins, not yours.\n\u2022  Therefore, your marginal probability for your coin should remain \u00bd.\n\nThis line of thought rests on a familiar rule: if X and Y are independent, learning Y gives no information about X.  But the rule presupposes ordinary (i.e., positive-probability) conditioning.  When the event on which we condition has probability 0, independence need not survive, because the very definition  \n\n   P(X | Y)=P(X\u2227Y)/P(Y)  \n\nbreaks down.  So the independence argument begs the question; we must ask whether a coherent conditional probability given F can be defined and, if so, what value it assigns to \u201cmy coin=H\u201d.\n\n3.  A regular conditional probability exists\n\nOn standard measure spaces such as the product space {H,T}^\u03c9 with the product \u03c3-algebra, we have the following mathematical fact: for any \u03c3-algebra \ud835\udd3e generated by tail events, there exists a regular conditional probability P(\u00b7 | \ud835\udd3e).  That conditional probability is unique up to \u03bd-null sets.  Since F is a tail event, we can ask for the regular conditional distribution of the whole sequence given F.  What does it say?\n\nIt says that, conditioned on F, with probability 1 there is a last index N such that coins 0,\u2026,N may display a mixture of heads and tails but coins N+1,N+2,\u2026 are all Tails.  (If there were not such an N, the total number of heads would be infinite.)  Moreover, the symmetry of the original process tells us that there is no preferred place for that cut-off: informally, \u201cN\u201d has an improper prior that is uniform over \u03c9.  In consequence, for every fixed agent i the conditional probability that i is among the finitely many heads is 0.  Hence\n\n   P(my coin=H | F)=0.\n\nSo if one accepts regular conditional probability as the correct extension of Bayesian conditioning to measure-zero events, the answer is unambiguous: the right credence is 0.\n\n4.  A more informal symmetry argument\n\nSuppose you remain suspicious of the measure-theoretic machinery.  An appeal to exchangeability yields the same verdict more intuitively.\n\nLet C be the random variable that counts Heads.  Given the oracle\u2019s news, C is finite.  Consider the sum of the conditional credences that each agent i assigns to the proposition \u201ci\u2019s coin is H\u201d.  By symmetry, everyone assigns the same number x.  But adding those credences across all \u03c9 agents gives an infinite series x+x+x+\u2026  Because countable additivity is required of rational degrees of belief, that sum must equal your conditional expectation of C.  Yet E(C | F) is finite.  The only way an infinite series of identical non-negative terms can have a finite sum is for each term to be 0.  Thus x=0.\n\n5.  Does the Borel\u2013Kolmogorov paradox threaten the result?\n\nOne might worry that conditional probabilities on measure-zero events are path-dependent: different ways of taking limits can yield different answers (the notorious Borel paradox).  However, the present conditioning event is characterised wholly by the tail \u03c3-algebra: \u201cthere are only finitely many heads\u201d is invariant under finite permutations of indices.  Any sequence of positive-measure cylinder sets that converges to F necessarily respects that symmetry, so all paths give the same conditional distribution.  In short, we are not in a Borel-paradox situation here; the probability 0 result is robust.\n\n6.  Objection: The oracle\u2019s message cannot rationally be believed\n\nAnother line of resistance says: if F had prior probability 0, no amount of testimony should make you assign it positive posterior probability.  Call this the \u201cdogmatic\u201d view about probability-zero propositions.  On that view the problem never gets off the ground, because a perfectly rational agent would regard the oracle\u2019s pronouncement as impossible.  If one nonetheless insists on taking the oracle at its word one is, ex hypothesi, departing from strict Bayesianism.  But there is no deep paradox here; we have simply stipulated that your epistemic state has changed to one in which F is regarded as certain.  The philosophical interest lies in seeing what follows under that stipulation.  Granting the stipulation, the regular-conditional story shows that the only coherent posterior has credence 0 for \u201cmy coin=H\u201d.\n\n7.  Independence revisited\n\nWhy did independence fail?  Because the oracle\u2019s message introduces correlations.  Knowing that at most finitely many Heads exist couples each individual outcome to every other; it is now impossible for both \u201cinfinitely many other agents are T\u201d and \u201cI am H\u201d to be false simultaneously.  Conditional on F, the random variables that were once independent are now strongly negatively correlated.  Independence is not metaphysically prior; it is a property of the joint distribution, and the joint distribution has been replaced by its conditional analogue.\n\n8.  Relation to classical frequentism\n\nFrom a frequentist perspective, probabilities are long-run relative frequencies in an ideal infinite sequence.  But after you have learned that only finitely many Heads occurred, the relative frequency of Heads in that sequence is 0.  Therefore the limiting frequency interpretation itself recommends conditional probability 0 for any pre-assigned index.  Bayesian and frequentist intuitions converge here.\n\n9.  Philosophical morals\n\na)  Learning probability-zero propositions.  \n   The case illustrates that conditionalising on measure-zero events is coherent and can yield informative credences, provided one employs the machinery of regular conditional probabilities.  It rebuts the claim that Bayesianism is intractably silent about such updates.\n\nb)  Independence is defeasible.  \n   Even perfect independence can be destroyed by new information about the ensemble to which a variable belongs.  This is a sobering lesson for informal reasoning that treats independence as sacrosanct.\n\nc)  \u201cTypicality\u201d and anthropic reasoning.  \n   Some people gloss the symmetry argument by saying: \u201cGiven there are only finitely many Heads in an infinite crowd, it is \u2018almost impossible\u2019 that I am one of them; hence credence 0.\u201d  That turn of phrase echoes anthropic reasoning about typicality: if a property is held only by finitely many members of an \u03c9-population, one should regard oneself as atypical should one possess it.  The present analysis formalises that intuitive thought.\n\nd)  Countable additivity as a normative constraint.  \n   The key symmetry argument hinges on the requirement that your beliefs over a countable partition sum to 1.  Anyone tempted to deny the update to 0 must either reject countable additivity or find some other way to block the step from \u201cfinite expected number of heads\u201d to \u201czero probability for any particular head\u201d.\n\n10.  A final worry: Can probability ever be exactly 0?\n\nSome philosophers (e.g. Popper, Keynes, certain subjectivists) have argued that rational agents should never assign precise probability 0 (or 1) to any contingent proposition.  If that scruple is accepted, both the prior for F and the posterior for \u201cmy coin=H\u201d are illegitimate.  Yet Bayesian practice already sanctions probability 0 for an infinity of outcomes (picking a real number exactly 1/\u03c0 from the unit interval, etc.).  So the scruple, while consistent, is an optional extra.  Those who reject sharp zeros can reformulate the example using \u03b5-events (\u201cat most a million heads\u201d), and the same qualitative conclusion obtains: your credence for Heads becomes vanishingly small.\n\n11.  Summing up the arguments\n\n\u2022  The regular-conditional calculus gives P(Heads | F)=0.  \n\u2022  A purely symmetry-based additivity argument arrives at the same figure.  \n\u2022  Independence does not survive conditioning on F.  \n\u2022  The Borel paradox does not undermine the result; the conditioning event is symmetric.  \n\u2022  Objections that probability-zero events are unlearnable simply sidestep the stipulated scenario.\n\nTherefore, rational credence that your coin landed Heads, given the oracle\u2019s information, should fall from \u00bd to 0.\n\n12.  Coda: a practical analogy\n\nSuppose an infinite lottery machine draws countably many tickets and announces that only finitely many tickets are prime numbers.  You hold a random ticket.  How confident should you be that your ticket\u2019s number is prime?  The reasoning above answers: confidence should be 0.  The moral is not restricted to coins; it is a structural feature of conditioning on information that restricts the cardinality of favourable outcomes within an infinite reference class.\n\n13.  Conclusion\n\nThe initially surprising conclusion\u2014that certainty of \u201conly finitely many Heads\u201d forces certainty of \u201cmy coin is Tail\u201d\u2014turns out to be a straightforward consequence of standard probabilistic principles once one extends them, as mathematicians do, to probability-zero events.  Philosophically, the case teaches that beliefs about one\u2019s own situation can shift dramatically in light of ensemble information, even when the physical mechanism governing one\u2019s own outcome is unchanged.  It is a vivid reminder that probability is not just about local causal processes; it is also\u2014and sometimes dominantly\u2014about global constraints.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 14, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 3093, "reasoning_tokens": 832}

Introduction  \n\nHuman beings do not form their aims in a vacuum. What we come to want is, in part, a response to the options life makes salient. When available alternatives are radically limited\u2014by poverty, illness, or social oppression\u2014it is often rational, even psychologically necessary, to scale one\u2019s aspirations down. Jon Elster called this phenomenon \u201csour grapes,\u201d but a broader label has taken hold: adaptive preferences. A Bangladeshi girl who says she prefers to marry at fourteen because \u201cgirls who wait become a burden,\u201d or the long-term prisoner who reports preferring a regimented prison routine to the risks and ambiguities of life outside, illustrate the point. They do not merely resign themselves to their lot; rather, their preferences adjust so that what they now positively want fits what they can realistically get.  \n\nSuch cases create a puzzle about autonomy. Respecting persons as self-governing agents requires that we take what they claim to want as a significant reason for action. Yet many find it intuitively plausible that adaptive preferences are, in an important sense, \u201cless than fully autonomous\u201d: the preference does not speak with the agent\u2019s authentic voice, or at least not with the authority an ordinary preference commands. The philosophical challenge is to say why.  \n\nThree broad strategies dominate contemporary debate.  \n\n\u2022 Subjectivist or structural accounts locate autonomy in an agent\u2019s reflective endorsement of her own motives\u2014Harry Frankfurt\u2019s hierarchical model is canonical.  \n\u2022 Content-based accounts say a preference can be autonomous only if what is preferred is itself morally acceptable or conducive to flourishing. Martha Nussbaum\u2019s capabilities approach provides a central example.  \n\u2022 Historical or procedural accounts focus on how the preference was formed, asking whether its etiology involves coercion, deception, or other autonomy-undermining influences.  \n\nI will argue that while each captures an important piece of the puzzle, a historically inflected procedural account\u2014augmented by minimal content thresholds and an internal endorsement condition\u2014best explains the autonomy deficit characteristic of adaptive preferences in contexts of oppression. The position is thus pluralistic, but the heavy lifting is done by the historical dimension. Subjectivist endorsement alone is too easy to secure; content-tests risk paternalism and neglect the agent\u2019s own viewpoint; a purely historical test sometimes over-diagnoses autonomy deficits. A hybrid that gives pride of place to genealogy yet retains modest structural and content requirements avoids these pitfalls.\n\n2. Subjectivist (Hierarchical) Accounts  \n\n2.1. The Frankfurtian Framework  \nFrankfurt proposes that what matters to autonomy is a structure of higher-order endorsement. I am autonomous with respect to a first-order desire D when I reflectively identify with D, wanting it to move me to action. This model is attractive because it honors the intuition that self-governing persons are capable of critical self-assessment.  \n\n2.2. Adaptive Preferences within the Hierarchy  \nOn Frankfurt\u2019s view, an adaptive preference can be perfectly autonomous if the agent wholeheartedly identifies with it. Suppose the prisoner not only prefers the prison routine but also endorses that preference after sustained reflection, feeling content with his limited world. The hierarchical test is satisfied. Yet many of us feel the case still involves an autonomy deficit. The prisoner\u2019s reflective endorsement seems itself a product of systemic deprivation.  \n\n2.3. Structural Conservatism  \nThe root problem is that hierarchical endorsement tests are silent about the context that shapes second-order desires. Because Frankfurt measures autonomy purely synchronically\u2014do the orders of desire cohere now?\u2014he misses diachronic or etiological deformations. The subjectivist view thereby threatens to ratify as fully autonomous any preference, no matter how suppressive its origins, so long as internal harmony is achieved. This yields what Serene Khader calls \u201cfalse consciousness on demand\u201d: oppressive socialization can generate wholehearted endorsement of one\u2019s own subordination.  \n\n3. Content-Based Accounts  \n\n3.1. The Objective-List Strategy  \nContent theorists respond by insisting that some preferences lack autonomy because what they aim at is incompatible with human flourishing. Nussbaum\u2019s capability approach, for instance, treats the preference for child marriage as non-autonomous because it accepts, even celebrates, a life below a threshold of functioning\u2014educational deprivation, bodily health risks, and curtailed political participation.  \n\n3.2. Explaining the Intuition  \nContent restrictions explain why we distrust the prisoner\u2019s preference: it endorses a condition lacking full social affiliation and practical reason, two of Nussbaum\u2019s central capabilities. Likewise, the \u201chappy housewife\u201d who says she prefers not to work outside the home is rejecting a valuable sphere of human activity. The content view thus offers a principled basis for doubting such preferences\u2019 authority.  \n\n3.3. Worries about Paternalism and Diversity  \nYet the cure threatens to be worse than the disease. Autonomy, conceptually, is about self-government, not about living well by some independent standard. A content criterion collapses the distinction between respecting a person\u2019s choices and directing her toward the good. Moreover, who decides which functionings are essential? Some women may autonomously choose domestic life without denying its value for them. Unless content requirements are minimal and culturally sensitive, they risk illegitimate paternalism.  \n\n4. Historical Accounts  \n\n4.1. Procedural Genealogy  \nThe historical strategy starts from the observation that what undermines autonomy in adaptive preferences is not (only) how they feel to the subject, nor (only) what they aim at, but how they came to be. A preference is non-autonomous, the story goes, when it results from processes that bypass the agent\u2019s critical capacities\u2014indoctrination, subtle coercion, social stigma, deprivation of imaginative alternatives.  \n\n4.2. Modeling Formation Conditions  \nSeveral models operationalize this idea.  \n\n\u2022 Robert Young\u2019s \u201cmanipulation\u201d account: a desire is autonomy-violating if produced by a process that subordinates one\u2019s interests to another\u2019s without consent.  \n\u2022 Sarah Buss\u2019s \u201calienating defeat\u201d: preferences that emerge as psychological defenses against domination lack autonomous authority.  \n\u2022 Andrea Westlund\u2019s \u201cdialogical autonomy\u201d: agents must be able to defend their choices in conversation with suitably critical interlocutors.  \n\n4.3. Application to Adaptive Preferences  \nConsider the adolescent child bride. Her community strictly limits her educational prospects, valorizes early marriage, and stigmatizes unmarried women. She therefore comes to prefer marriage at fourteen. The historical perspective notes that the preference arises through a constrained socialization that systemically restricts exposure to alternatives and punishes deviation. That causal history explains why the preference is autonomy-deficient even if, at a first-person level, she endorses it and even if, content-wise, the preference is not per se immoral (marriage is not inherently wrong).  \n\n4.4. Advantages over Rival Accounts  \nHistorical views avoid Frankfurt\u2019s structural blindness because endorsement obtained via oppressive formation mechanisms is compromised. They also avoid the paternalism worry plaguing content theories: autonomy criticism targets the defective process, not the life-plan chosen. If an agent, with full access to alternatives and under non-coercive conditions, still chooses early marriage, the historical account can regard the preference as autonomous regardless of the capability deficits it may entail. In short, it respects self-government while recognizing that self-governance itself can be socially undermined.  \n\n4.5. Remaining Challenges  \nHistorical tests must distinguish between illegitimately and legitimately influential socialization. All preferences depend on upbringing; total independence from causal history is impossible. The task is to identify the kind of shaping that is autonomy-defeating. Without further elaboration, the historical view risks over-inclusive skepticism, branding most socially learned desires non-autonomous.\n\n5. Toward a Hybrid Account  \n\nNo single strategy delivers a complete account. A plausible theory of autonomy for adaptive preferences should satisfy three desiderata.\n\n1. Context-Sensitivity: capture the role of oppressive constraints.  \n2. Agent-Centeredness: honor the subject\u2019s own standpoint and reflective capacities.  \n3. Anti-Paternalism: avoid imposing a controversial conception of the good.  \n\n5.1. The Historical Core  \nThe etiology of a preference is primary: a desire formed under domination, systematic deception, or severe material deprivation is presumptively suspect. The relevant benchmark is counter-factual; would the agent embrace the preference under conditions of adequately diverse options, information, and secure self-respect? This \u201cbut for oppression\u201d test echoes the capability idea of \u201creal freedom,\u201d yet remains procedural: the key is whether the agent had opportunity to assess alternatives, not whether she would have chosen them.  \n\n5.2. Minimal Endorsement Requirement  \nEven if a preference has a benign history, it cannot be autonomous unless the agent currently identifies with it upon critical reflection. This re-introduces a subjectivist structural element, but as a necessary\u2014not sufficient\u2014condition. Frankfurt was right that autonomy involves reflective self-relation; he was wrong that this alone is decisive.  \n\n5.3. Minimal Content Threshold  \nFinally, we need modest content limits. A preference for self-dismemberment or extinction cannot be autonomous even if reflectively endorsed and not oppressively induced; its object eradicates the very conditions for autonomy. Such limits can be slim: the preference must not directly self-defeat the exercise of future autonomy, nor aim at manifestly unjust harm to others. This keeps paternalistic interference to a minimum while safeguarding the enterprise of self-government itself.\n\n6. Comparative Evaluation  \n\n6.1. Explaining Autonomy Deficits in Paradigm Cases  \n\nCase 1: The \u201cHappy Housewife\u201d under Patriarchy  \n\u2022 Hierarchical: autonomous (she endorses it).  \n\u2022 Content: non-autonomous if paid work is required for flourishing.  \n\u2022 Historical-Hybrid: prima facie non-autonomous given patriarchal socialization; however, if the woman had serious exposure to real alternatives and still endorses domesticity, the hybrid view credits autonomy. This matches our nuanced intuitions.  \n\nCase 2: Prisoner Preferring Confinement  \n\u2022 Hierarchical: autonomous.  \n\u2022 Content: non-autonomous (lack of freedom undermines capabilities).  \n\u2022 Historical-Hybrid: non-autonomous because the preference would likely not survive absent coercive incarceration.  \n\nCase 3: Ascetic Monk Freely Choosing Poverty  \n\u2022 Hierarchical: autonomous.  \n\u2022 Content: possibly non-autonomous (capability deprivation).  \n\u2022 Historical-Hybrid: autonomous provided the monk had opportunities to pursue other lives, understands what he forgoes, and reflectsively endorses asceticism. Many regard such a life as admirable; the hybrid view secures that verdict.  \n\n6.2. Normative Up-Shot  \nThe hybrid account justifies selective paternalism: intervention is warranted not whenever a life falls below an objective capability threshold, but when those deficits result from autonomy-thwarting histories. This explains why development ethicists prioritize expanding women\u2019s educational opportunities rather than nullifying marriages already chosen; the remedy targets formative constraints, not the mere fact that someone lives a way we disapprove.  \n\n7. Objections and Replies  \n\nObjection 1: The historical test is epistemically infeasible\u2014we cannot know the causal history of each preference.  \nReply: We rarely need precision. Structural injustices are often public and obvious. When causal origins are opaque, respect for agency counsels deference; the presumption of autonomy stands unless strong evidence shows oppressive formation.  \n\nObjection 2: The hybrid still sneaks in paternalism via the counter-factual test; who decides what counts as \u201cadequate alternatives\u201d?  \nReply: The benchmark is not substantive options judged good by outsiders, but the diversity actually prized by the agent\u2019s own society plus feasible expansions. Empirical work\u2014surveys, participatory deliberation\u2014helps identify which missing options people themselves regret lacking.  \n\nObjection 3: Some adaptive preferences appear psychologically indispensable\u2014denigrating them risks depriving individuals of coping strategies.  \nReply: The normative claim is not that agents ought to abandon such preferences now, but that we (third parties, policymakers) should not treat those preferences as conclusive reasons against altering the unjust background that necessitates them. A prisoner\u2019s preference for confinement may merit compassionate respect, while still supplying no decisive reason to perpetuate mass incarceration.  \n\n8. Conclusion  \n\nAdaptive preferences dramatize the vulnerability of human autonomy to social context. Frankfurt\u2019s internalist hierarchy attends to self-reflection but misses oppressive genealogy; Nussbaum\u2019s capability approach highlights objective harm but risks conflating autonomy with flourishing. A historically grounded procedural account, supplemented with modest endorsement and content constraints, best explains why preferences sculpted under deprivation or domination speak with a muted authority.  \n\nWe thereby steer a middle path. We refuse blanket skepticism about the agency of persons whose ideals diverge from Western liberal norms, yet we decline to grant carte blanche to every avowed preference. Autonomy is neither purely a matter of inner endorsement nor simply of wanting the right things, but is a fragile achievement rooted in the social conditions that enable persons to imagine, compare, and commit to diverse ways of living. Constraints that shrink those conditions trace their mark in the very desires people form, and it is in that historical trace, more than in the mere structure or content of desire, that the autonomy deficit of adaptive preferences is to be found.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 0, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 3199, "reasoning_tokens": 384}

Introduction  \n\nIn many real\u2010world settings people come to want exactly what their situation permits them to get. A woman in a society that educates only boys painstakingly persuades herself that book-learning is pointless for her kind; a South African domestic worker who cannot afford meat acquires a taste for maize porridge and tells the interviewer that she \u201chonestly prefers it\u201d; an illiterate bonded labourer in rural Pakistan reports that he \u201cwouldn\u2019t know what to do\u201d with political freedom. In each instance the preference seems at once intelligible and yet suspiciously servile. Sen, Nussbaum and other development theorists have christened such states \u201cadaptive preferences\u201d: preference orderings shaped, sometimes unconsciously, in response to severe and systematic constraints.  \n\nWhat threatens our intuitive judgment that agents with adaptive preferences are not fully free or self-governing? The answer must be that autonomy\u2014whatever it exactly consists in\u2014requires more than having a preference that issues in action. But which aspect of autonomy is abridged? Contemporary philosophical discussions divide the field into three broad explanatory families.\n\n1. Subjectivist or structural accounts: what matters is an agent\u2019s reflective endorsement of her own motivational set. If the woman wholeheartedly wants domesticity and identifies with her desire, no further debit to autonomy is incurred. The paradigm is Harry Frankfurt\u2019s hierarchical model, refined by Gerald Dworkin.  \n\n2. Content-based or substantive accounts: certain desires are autonomy-defeating because of what they aim at. If a preference is for degrading or oppressive goods, or if it abandons objectively valuable capabilities, then it cannot be the expression of full self-government, whatever the person thinks. Joseph Raz\u2019s ideal of autonomy fits here, as do Nussbaum\u2019s capability arguments.  \n\n3. Historical or etiological accounts: the deficit arises not (only) from lack of current endorsement nor from objectionable content, but from the way the preference was produced. If it was implanted by manipulation, coercion, habituation under injustice, or resulted from ignorance that would have been avoidable under better social conditions, then the preference is less than self-authored. Jon Elster, Alfred Mele and John Christman supply the template.\n\nThis essay defends a qualified historical diagnosis. Subjectivist theories explain too little; content theories explain too much. A historically sensitive picture aligns with our reactions to adaptive preferences in cases of oppression without criminalising every humble or modest aspiration. Still, the better view is pluralistic: we need structural endorsement at the personal level and substantive moral limits in order to complete the story of what autonomy requires. But when we ask what in particular deprives adaptive preferences of full authority, the lion\u2019s share of the work is done by the history of adaptive formation\u2014by the causal pathway through which agents were constrained to recalibrate their aspirations.\n\n2. Limits of purely subjectivist (structural) accounts  \n\nFrankfurt\u2019s original thought is elegant: what matters for autonomy is whether the motivational state that moves me is one with which I identify at a higher level of reflection. A wanton addict is propelled by a first-order desire for heroin while wishing at a second order not to be moved by that desire; the addict therefore lacks volitional autonomy. In contrast, a willing addict who wholeheartedly endorses his drug hunger acts freely. On this model, the South African domestic worker\u2019s preference for maize would be fully autonomous if she reflects and still wants to want maize, e.g. \u201cI revel in the taste, I regard meat as greasy and heavy; I reject other people\u2019s values.\u201d  \n\nBut our intuitive unease remains. Imagine giving the woman information about nutrition, removing the price differential, and guaranteeing no social penalty for changing dietary habits. We suspect that she would quite probably revise her preference. That suspicion does not disappear merely because, under current constraints, she sincerely endorses the taste for maize. The structural model thus seems blind to the fact that endorsement can itself be distorted by constraint.  \n\nFrankfurt can answer that endorsement must be \u201cauthentic\u201d, but on his formulation authenticity is just the absence of further disidentification. An impoverished set of opportunities can close off the psychological space in which second-order reflection might mobilise. Identification, in short, is cheap; it can occur even within an oppressive environment that edits out alternative identities before the subject is old enough to imagine them.  \n\nGerald Dworkin tries to tighten the screws: a preference counts as autonomous only if the agent has exercised procedural competencies (e.g. critical reflection, absence of coercion, full information). Yet adaptive preferences typically pass that test from the inside. The villager knows that other people elsewhere eat meat, she realises it has protein, she is not at gunpoint; she still sincerely dislikes it. What seems missing is not reflective aptitude\u2014she may be clever and self-aware\u2014but that her second-order standpoint was itself moulded by conditions she never had a chance to escape.  \n\nThe deeper problem is that purely structural accounts detach autonomy from the world in which the person developed. They treat the mind as a self-contained hierarchy whose endorsement operations are equally valid irrespective of the past. Consequently, they have difficulty explaining why some wholehearted endorsements strike us as tragic acquiescence. They also incline toward a laissez-faire politics: if endorsement suffices, oppression disappears in a puff of subjectivist smoke as soon as victims identify with their lot.\n\n3. Overreach of content-based theories  \n\nThe opposite family of accounts replies that to be autonomous is to lead a life of one\u2019s own in pursuit of objectively valuable goods. Joseph Raz says an autonomous person must have an adequate range of morally acceptable options. Similarly, Martha Nussbaum speaks of central human capabilities\u2014bodily integrity, practical reason, play, affiliation\u2014that must remain live possibilities if a person is to flourish. If the Pakistani labourer lacks literacy or political participation and therefore does not even want them, the absence of those capabilities proves his diminished autonomy.  \n\nThe attraction here is clear. Oppression is objectionable partly because it deprives people of crucial human goods, and any preference that colludes with that deprivation is suspect. Yet content accounts overshoot the target in two ways.\n\nFirst, they collapse autonomy into a thick account of the good. Suppose an ascetic monk freely renounces bodily pleasures for spiritual union. If sexual intimacy is among the capabilities or generic goods, the monk apparently lacks autonomy. That seems wrong; voluntary monasticism is a paradigm of self-authorship.  \n\nSecond, content theories risk classifying every modest or mundane preference as autonomy-deficient if it does not aspire to grand excellences. A factory worker who honestly enjoys repetitive labour and evenings of television would be deemed unfree because he fails to value \u201cany robust exercise of practical reason\u201d. But autonomy is not heroism. Ordinary lives can be self-chosen.  \n\nMoreover, content accounts still do not pinpoint what is distinctively troublesome about adaptive preferences. Intuitively, the issue is not that maize or domesticity is an unworthy object, period; it is that these preferences arose in response to injustice. If the same taste for maize had emerged in a corn-abundant utopia where everyone is well nourished, we would not flinch. So it must be something about origin, not content per se.\n\n4. The historical explanation  \n\nHistorical or etiological models locate autonomy in the agent\u2019s authorship across time. Preferences are autonomous only if they were produced by processes that respect the person\u2019s capacities for critical reflection and self-direction, and were not caused in ways that bypass or impede those capacities.  \n\nJon Elster first used adaptive preferences to illustrate how rational\u2010choice theory must be tempered by psychological reality: prisoners who cannot reach the grapes declare them sour. Alfred Mele argues that manipulation and coercive socialisation can implant desires that the agent would not have acquired had she been left to her own devices. John Christman refines the view: a desire is autonomous if (1) it is reflectively endorsed now, provided that (2) this endorsement would survive an appropriately wide range of counterfactual learning conditions, and (3) the causal process that produced the desire was not one the agent would disavow under those same conditions.  \n\nWhy does this framework fit adaptive preferences?\n\n4.1 The mechanism of adaptive formation  \nPsychological studies of \u201chedonic adaptation\u201d show that people recalibrate aspiration levels in response to long\u2010term deprivation: they de-sensitise themselves to foregone goods, exaggerate the value of what they can obtain and lower the salience of inaccessible alternatives. This coping strategy helps maintain subjective well-being, but it operates largely nonconsciously. An agent who engages in such self-protective revision is not exercising her deliberative agency; rather, her motivational system is being bent by environmental feedback loops.  \n\n4.2 Bypassing of critical capacities  \nChristman\u2019s \u201cbypass\u201d constraint captures precisely this worry. The South African worker\u2019s palate was trained from infancy by scarcity; the Pakistani labourer\u2019s political docility stems from illiteracy and fear of retribution. The causal route bypassed capacities\u2014education, credible information sources, protected possibilities for dissent\u2014that would have enabled them to ask \u201cDo I really prefer this?\u201d  \n\n4.3 Counterfactual reflection test  \nWhen we imagine the persons in a world without oppressive constraints\u2014offering affordable meat, tuition for adults, secure civic liberties\u2014we anticipate that they would revise their preferences. Historical accounts incorporate this intuition by asking whether the desire would survive under better information and expanded opportunity. If not, its current authority is weak.  \n\n4.4 Explaining variation  \nHistorical diagnosis also honours the variation that content theories ignore. Some adaptive tastes may indeed survive liberation. A desert nomad given the opportunity to live in a city might still love the sand\u2010dune life; Bedouin culture could be a genuinely chosen good. Because the historical view focuses on whether the preference was forced, not on what it is for, it allows for such possibility and thus avoids paternalism.  \n\n5. Replies to objections  \n\nObjection 1: The historical model collapses into content if it appeals to \u201cbetter information\u201d and \u201cimproved capacities\u201d. After all, what counts as a relevant capacity depends on a normative ideal.  \n\nReply: Yes, autonomy theory inevitably has a thin normative core (e.g. literacy enhances choice). But historical accounts do not prescribe a catalogue of life plans; they specify procedural and epistemic conditions for preference formation. The worry is not that the maize eater fails to value steak; it is that her very reasons for preferring maize trace back to circumstances she herself would deem faulty were she suitably informed.  \n\nObjection 2: Some oppressed persons reflect lucidly on their options and still affirm the adaptive preference. Does the historical model paternalistically overrule them?  \n\nReply: The view distinguishes present reflection sufficiency from diachronic endorsement under conditions of equal power. Even if the woman now affirms domesticity, if the preference was originally formed through indoctrination that she herself, imagining a different upbringing, would reject, then the preference remains partially heteronomous. Importantly, the model grades rather than binary classifies. Her autonomy is not void but impaired; interventions should therefore be respectful and enabling, not coercive.  \n\nObjection 3: Etiology cannot bear all the weight because manipulative origins can be washed away by later authentic appropriation\u2014think of someone brainwashed as a child who years later re-examines her values and retains them after deliberation.  \n\nReply: Historical theorists concede this by including the current-day endorsement condition. If, after extensive exposure to alternatives, the agent still identifies with the inherited preference, the historical taint dissipates. What matters is whether the person has had a credible chance to repudiate the causal history. Adaptive preferences in ongoing oppressive contexts rarely meet that criterion.\n\n6. Political implications  \n\nThe historical account guides policy in a distinctive way. It does not license blunt eradication of disfavoured tastes, nor complacent acceptance of any endorsed desire. Instead it recommends:\n\na. Expanding feasible options (education, economic resources, legal protection) so that agents may test their preferences against real alternatives.  \nb. Securing informational transparency and cultural space for critical dialogue.  \nc. Monitoring coercive or manipulative socialisation practices\u2014gendered curricula, media stereotypes, caste rituals\u2014that bypass evaluative capacities.  \nd. Respecting agents\u2019 eventual choices when, under improved circumstances, they reaffirm their earlier preferences.\n\nThus the aim is to remove the adaptive pressure, not to substitute outsider judgment for local values. Autonomy, on this view, flourishes when the causal chain between social conditions and personal endorsement runs through unblocked channels of deliberation.\n\n7. Concluding synthesis  \n\nSubjectivist structural accounts correctly stress the importance of identification, but underestimate how oppressive contexts mould second-order desires themselves. Content accounts rightly highlight that self\u2010government cannot be entirely divorced from human flourishing, yet overstep by tying autonomy to a thick list of goods. Historical accounts capture the middle ground: they diagnose the autonomy deficit in adaptive preferences by tracing how unjust constraints infiltrate the preference-forming process, short-circuiting the agent\u2019s evaluative faculties.\n\nNevertheless the three perspectives are not mutually exclusive. Full autonomy probably requires:\n\n1. Structural endorsement (the agent owns her desires here and now).  \n2. Procedural\u2010historical integrity (endorsement has not been engineered by bypassing her critical capacities).  \n3. A threshold range of valuable opportunities (one cannot choose at all in the absence of any decent options).\n\nIn cases of adaptive preference under oppression, it is primarily the second criterion that fails, with the third serving as background explanation and the first as the misleading surface. Recognising this layered structure allows us to resist two extremes: the romanticisation of acceptance and the moralistic condemnation of any preference that falls short of liberal ideals. The task is to unlock the history, open the field of choice, and then trust persons\u2014now better situated\u2014to author their own lives.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 1, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 3013, "reasoning_tokens": 128}

Introduction  \n\nThe notion of adaptive preference\u2014coined by Jon Elster after Robert Merton\u2019s sociological work and Aesop\u2019s fox\u2014names a common human tendency: in the face of persistent constraints, people come to want what they can, rather than can what they want. The peasant tells herself she does not really long for education; the sweat-shop worker declares she prefers factory labor to rural idleness; women in patriarchal cultures report that they actually like infibulation or seclusion. These preferences raise a puzzle. They are undeniably sincerely held\u2014agents would, if queried, assent to them, deliberate on their basis, and often defend them with conviction. And yet many observers have the intuition that something is amiss: the preferences feel heteronomous, distorted, less than fully their own.  \n\nWhy exactly do they count as less than fully autonomous? Three broad families of answers dominate recent debate.  \n\n\u2022 Subjectivist or structural accounts measure autonomy by internal relations among an agent\u2019s desires. Frankfurtian hierarchical endorsement theories are the best-known.  \n\n\u2022 Content-based or substantive accounts measure autonomy partly by the moral or prudential value of what is chosen; an agent\u2019s preference for a life of slavery is itself evidence of impaired self-rule because slavery is bad, period.  \n\n\u2022 Historical accounts focus on the genesis of desires; if a preference is produced by manipulation, indoctrination, or oppressive socialisation, it fails to be self-authored even if, at the time of action, it is wholeheartedly embraced.  \n\nMy aim is threefold: (i) to examine how each camp tries to explain the autonomy deficit of adaptive preferences; (ii) to test their explanatory power against paradigmatic cases of oppression; and (iii) to defend a modified historical diagnosis that incorporates insights from the other two views while avoiding their shortcomings.\n\n2. Subjectivist or Hierarchical Accounts  \n\n2.1 The Frankfurtian Model  \nFor Harry Frankfurt an agent is autonomous when she acts on a first-order desire that she endorses at a higher level. If I both want X and want to want X (or identify with that desire after critical reflection), X-wanting is \u201cmine\u201d in the robust sense relevant to autonomy. Deficiencies arise when there is no such endorsement, when higher-order attitudes are themselves manipulated, or when the agent is incapable of forming them (the unwilling addict, the wanton child).  \n\n2.2 Applying the Model to Adaptive Preferences  \nSuppose Rani lives in a society where women are denied education. Over years she ceases to care about schooling and instead comes to prize domestic excellence. Does she endorse her desire to stay at home? Often she does\u2014she can articulate reasons, finds the prospect of school faintly distasteful, perhaps feels pride in conforming to the ideal of a good daughter. On Frankfurt\u2019s view, if her second-order attitudes endorse the first-order desire, the preference is autonomous. So the account appears to let too many adaptive preferences through the gate.\n\n2.3 Proposed Refinements  \nHierarchical theorists reply that endorsement must be grounded in \u201cauthentic reflection,\u201d \u201cfull information,\u201d or \u201cprocedural independence.\u201d But each refinement risks covertly smuggling in the very historical and substantive conditions the pure structure was supposed to avoid. To require that Rani reflect under conditions free of intimidation and misinformation is precisely to attend to the causal history; to insist that she have access to the real value of education is to appeal to content (truth, welfare). Once we acknowledge these supplements, the hierarchical model on its own no longer bears the weight of explanation. \n\nMoreover, the model struggles with cases where endorsement is itself the result of adaptive dampening. The oppressed often forestall psychic pain by cultivating second-order satisfaction in the preferences they find themselves having\u2014an intrapsychic coping mechanism. But if such coping counts as genuine endorsement, the account again pathologises too little. If, conversely, endorsement achieved under non-ideal background conditions is ruled inauthentic, we have shifted from a purely structural test to a genealogical one.\n\n3. Content-Based (Substantive) Accounts  \n\n3.1 The Basic Idea  \nSome philosophers\u2014e.g., Joseph Raz, Martha Nussbaum in her earlier work, and, in a stronger vein, perfectionists\u2014argue that autonomy requires an adequate range of objectively valuable options. A preference for genital cutting or degrading labour is evidence, not just of local malfunction, but of crippled self-realisation, because these states of affairs are themselves contrary to human flourishing. \n\n3.2 Explaining the Autonomy Deficit  \nOn this view Rani\u2019s preference is non-autonomous because it aims at something that fails to contribute to her well-being; the preference could only arise in circumstances where her objective interests are suppressed. The wrongness of the content thus signals and partly constitutes the absence of autonomy. \n\n3.3 Advantages  \nContent-based views capture an important intuition: one may exercise volition impeccably and yet fail at self-government if what one wills is servility, mutilation, self-annihilation. They also explain why liberal respect for choice cannot be absolute; some choices are simply bad enough to lack authority. \n\n3.4 Problems  \nFirst, content assessments risk paternalism: they license outsiders to pronounce that someone\u2019s life plan is inauthentic because it is \u201cobjectively bad.\u201d Second, content evaluations do not account for all adaptive cases. Suppose Ajay, born into poverty, forgoes university not because it is valueless but because he prefers, quite sincerely, the steady income of a taxi driver. Driving taxis is not intrinsically disvaluable; yet we may still sense an autonomy loss if Ajay\u2019s preference results from a social structure that left him no taste of intellectual pursuits. Third, content-based accounts cannot, by themselves, distinguish an adaptive preference from an ordinarily formed harmful preference. A billionaire might autonomously choose heroin addiction, which is objectively bad. The question is why the oppressed person\u2019s self-undermining desire signals heteronomy whereas the privileged addict\u2019s does not. Content alone cannot deliver that contrast; genesis matters.\n\n4. Historical or Genealogical Accounts  \n\n4.1 Core Thesis  \nHistorical accounts, championed by Gerald Dworkin, Marina Oshana, Natalie Stoljar, and most forcefully by Diana Tietjens Meyers and Serene Khader, hold that a desire\u2019s autonomy status depends crucially on its provenance. If the desire is the product of coercion, deception, or oppressive socialisation, it is not self-authored. \n\n4.2 Adaptive Preferences under Oppression  \nAdaptive preferences are paradigmatically shaped by material deprivation, ideological inculcation, normative stereotypes, threat of sanctions, or the chronic need to preserve self-respect in hostile environments. Those causal factors are precisely the autonomy-undermining mechanisms historical views track.  \n\n4.3 Strengths  \na) They explain why content need not be disvaluable for autonomy to falter. Imagine a devoutly religious woman who, because no other roles were encouraged, earnestly longs to be a nurse. Nursing is valuable, yet her preference may still count as adaptive if it was formed under unjust gender expectations that limited her imaginative horizons.  \nb) They avoid, to some extent, paternalism. The judgment is not that the content is bad for her, but that it is not sufficiently hers.  \nc) They accommodate the psychological reality of oppression: not only first- but also second-order desires can be fabricated by social power.  \n\n4.4 The Manipulation Objection  \nCritics worry that all our preferences emerge from social influence; where do we draw the line? Historical theorists reply that ordinary socialisation differs from oppressive socialisation in degree and in kind. The latter systematically deprives agents of the epistemic and material resources necessary to form alternatives; it uses threat or domination rather than mere persuasion; it silences contradictory experiences. Hybrid proposals often import procedural benchmarks\u2014absence of coercion, availability of opportunities, critical capacity\u2014to distinguish benign from malignant history.\n\n4.5 The \u201cAgency Under Oppression\u201d Challenge  \nIf we brand all desires of the oppressed as heteronomous, do we not rob them of agency and perpetuate a colonial gaze? Historical accounts must thus be sensitive: autonomy deficit is a matter of degree, not an all-or-nothing label, and agents routinely exercise creativity even within constraints. Recognising distorted genesis should empower rather than infantilise.\n\n5. Case Studies  \n\n5.1 The Satisficing Labourer  \nJorge grows up in a shanty town. He consciously renounces dreams of becoming an engineer, prefers informal construction work, and endorses that preference: \u201cAcademic life sounds boring; I like tangible results.\u201d Content is not disvaluable; hierarchical endorsement is present; yet the preference looks adaptively formed. A historical diagnosis fits: Jorge never encountered role models, his school lacked resources, and he internalised the stigma that university \u201cisn\u2019t for people like us.\u201d  \n\n5.2 The Peasant Girl and Early Marriage  \nAisha, 14, \u201cprefers\u201d early marriage because unmarried women are harassed. The content (early marriage) is arguably bad; she endorses it; the genesis traces to patriarchal risk-avoidance. All three accounts register problems, but the historical view explains most convincingly why her second-order endorsement is not enough\u2014the preference is a survival strategy under threat.\n\n5.3 The Secular Monk  \nJonas voluntarily enters a monastery seeking poverty and obedience. Neither oppression nor material deprivation drove him; he enjoyed broad opportunity and reflection. The content (asceticism) might seem objectively sub-optimal to some, but we hesitate to call it heteronomous; likewise, its genealogy is free of domination. This shows that substantive badness is not sufficient for an autonomy verdict, supporting the historical emphasis.\n\n6. The Interdependence Thesis  \n\nDespite their rivalry, the three families are not mutually exclusive. Autonomy is plausibly multi-dimensional. Yet explanatory priority matters when targeting adaptive preference. Consider the following claims:\n\nClaim 1 (Hierarchy is Insufficient): Because higher-order assent itself can be adaptively manufactured, structural endorsement cannot by itself rescue autonomy.\n\nClaim 2 (Content is Neither Necessary nor Sufficient): Some adaptive preferences aim at valuable ends; some non-adaptive preferences aim at worthless ends. Therefore content plays only a diagnostic, not foundational, role.\n\nClaim 3 (History is Necessary, Possibly Sufficient): Without reference to origin under domination, we cannot understand why otherwise ordinary preferences are defective. And if the genesis involves suitably egregious oppression, no amount of present-time endorsement can fully redeem them.\n\nIf these claims hold, historical accounts best pinpoint the autonomy shortfall.\n\n7. A Modified Historical Account  \n\nStill, two refinements are desirable.\n\nFirst, the account should be gradational. The causal forces acting on desire formation admit of degrees. Autonomy deficits range from minimal (ordinary peer influence) to severe (brainwashing). Adaptive preferences often sit in the middle: not coercion tout court, but pressure, limited horizons, stereotype threat. We need a scalar model.\n\nSecond, the account should incorporate procedural and content safeguards not as primary criteria but as corroborative indicators. A history of domination typically correlates with (a) lack of critical reflection opportunities and (b) ends that undermine flourishing. Thus, while history does the conceptual work, structure and content supply evidence.\n\nProposed Principle: A preference is less than fully autonomous to the extent that its formation involved social or material forces systematically aimed at restricting the agent\u2019s option range, self-conception, or evaluative capacities in ways that serve the interests of a dominating group; corroborating signs include (i) absence of counterfactual opportunities for critical reassessment, (ii) concurrence with objectively harmful outcomes, and (iii) psychological coping mechanisms designed to reconcile the agent with subordination.\n\n8. Objections and Replies  \n\nObjection A (The Universal History Problem): Every preference has a history of social influence. Why single out adaptive ones?\n\nReply: Influence undermines autonomy only when it operates through domination\u2014when the agent could not reasonably resist without significant cost, and when alternative self-conceptions were intentionally or structurally suppressed. Ordinary cultural shaping lacks these features.\n\nObjection B (Paternalism Redux): Declaring someone\u2019s preferences non-autonomous licences intervention.\n\nReply: Recognition of autonomy deficits need not entail coercive intervention; it can ground duties to expand opportunity sets, provide information, and contest oppressive norms. The goal is empowerment, not replacement of judgment.\n\nObjection C (Resilience of Second-Order Endorsement): What if the oppressed, once placed in ideal conditions, still choose the same preference?\n\nReply: Then the preference may be retroactively ratified. Historical taint is defeasible: if, under expanded horizons and without threat, the agent reaffirms the desire, its autonomy status improves. Note, however, that many empirically studied adaptive preferences diminish once constraints lift (e.g., women abandoning FGM when legal and social support exists).\n\n9. Policy and Ethical Implications  \n\nA correct diagnosis matters for development ethics, feminist practice, and medical consent.  \n\n\u2022 Development: If poor villagers refuse schooling for daughters, a historical account urges us not simply to respect choice nor to dismiss it as ignorant, but to dismantle the institutional gender bias and create enabling conditions for genuine choice.  \n\n\u2022 Feminism: Confronting internalised misogyny requires strategies that respect women\u2019s agency while exposing oppressive origins\u2014dialogue, consciousness-raising, economic empowerment.  \n\n\u2022 Bioethics: When patients decline certain treatments due to culturally inculcated fatalism, autonomy evaluation must ask about the social history of that fatalism, not just immediate decisional capacity.\n\n10. Conclusion  \n\nAdaptive preferences illustrate a tension between two liberal commitments: respecting agents\u2019 stated choices and condemning the unjust structures that shape those choices. Among the philosophical tools available, historical accounts best elucidate why such preferences are less than fully autonomous. Purely subjectivist models overlook how second-order desires themselves can be bent by necessity; purely content-based models mistake bad outcomes for compromised agency. A refined historical approach, sensitive to gradations and informed by auxiliary procedural and substantive clues, preserves the intuition that something has gone wrong without denying the oppressed their rational subjectivity.\n\nAutonomy, then, is not simply a matter of wanting what one wants, nor of wanting what is good, but of wanting in a world that allows one genuinely to want otherwise. When social power forecloses that world, the self\u2019s authorship of its own desires is fatally compromised. Recognising this fact is the first step toward remedying not merely preference deficits but the injustices that engender them.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 2, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 3157, "reasoning_tokens": 64}

Introduction: Adaptive preferences and the puzzle of autonomy    \n\nThe literature on \u201cadaptive preferences\u201d begins from an empirically familiar, philosophically puzzling phenomenon. Agents who face systematic, long-term constraints\u2014material poverty, racist insults, patriarchal vulnerability\u2014often come to desire precisely what those constraints make feasible, relinquishing what earlier or counterfactual selves might have valued. Amartya Sen\u2019s rural widows who say they do not need protein, Jon Elster\u2019s \u201csour grapes\u201d fox, and the woman in Marilyn Friedman\u2019s classroom who insisted she \u201cwanted\u201d excision of her clitoris because it marked her as a properly \u201cclean\u201d Sudanese bride are standard examples. These cases invite two apparently incompatible judgments. First, the preferences appear in some sense inauthentic or \u201cless than fully autonomous.\u201d Second, the agents themselves may sincerely avow them and may not experience coercion at the moment of choice. What, then, explains the autonomy deficit? Three families of answers compete:\n\nA. Subjectivist or procedural accounts, epitomised by Harry Frankfurt\u2019s hierarchical model, ground autonomy in the structure of an agent\u2019s current will\u2014roughly, in whether a desire is reflectively endorsed.\n\nB. Content-based or substantive accounts locate autonomy in the objective worth of what is preferred: a preference that targets a degraded form of life, or one that precludes the development of central human capabilities, is ipso facto non-autonomous.\n\nC. Historical (often \u201crelational\u201d) accounts ground autonomy in the causal story of preference formation: a preference is autonomous only if it is untainted by manipulation, coercion, or oppressive socialisation.\n\nI will argue that each account captures a genuine insight, yet historical-relational theories best diagnose the distinctive autonomy deficit of adaptive preferences in oppressive contexts. They do so because the deficit typically lies not in the agent\u2019s present lack of second-order endorsement (many such agents endorse their desires), nor necessarily in the poverty of the preference\u2019s content by some objective standard (we sometimes adapt in innocuous ways), but in the distorting social processes that produced the preference. Still, a purely historical criterion is incomplete: we must integrate procedural reflection and some minimal substantive constraints to explain how an agent could, in principle, liberate herself from the distortion. I therefore propose a hybrid: an adaptive preference is non-autonomous when it is the product of oppressive formative forces that the agent could not have scrutinised under conditions of adequate self-respect, information, and social recognition.\n\n2. Subjectivist endorsement: autonomy as internal identification    \n\nSubjectivist accounts emphasise agency \u201cfrom the inside.\u201d On Frankfurt\u2019s influential model, a person is autonomous with respect to a first-order desire d if she wants to want d (a second-order volition) and, crucially, the second-order volition is not itself the target of higher-order alienation. Later proceduralists\u2014Gerald Dworkin, David Velleman, and some readings of John Christman\u2014offer refinements: the endorsement must be reflectively self-conscious, based on rational deliberation, or coherent with the agent\u2019s diachronic practical identity.\n\nAdaptive preference cases initially seem tractable within such a model. If the Sudanese woman, on honest reflection, says: \u201cYes, I wholeheartedly want circumcision; I would not want not to want it,\u201d Frankfurt must grant that the desire is authentic. Indeed, Frankfurt\u2019s earliest paper deploys the folktale \u201cThe Fox and the Grapes\u201d to illustrate that people can rationally adopt new ends to mitigate frustration. Yet many philosophers find the verdict unsatisfactory. What bothers us is not merely a misalignment between first- and second-order desires\u2014the woman may be aligned all the way up\u2014but the social fact that her volitional hierarchy itself has been shaped by patriarchal norms that brand intact female genitalia as disgraceful. Internal endorsement, therefore, seems too \u201cinternal.\u201d It ignores the possibility that whole tiers of desire may have been colonised by ideology.\n\nSome defenders add procedural conditions meant to block such cases. Christman, for instance, requires that the agent have the capacity to recognise and challenge social influences and that no influence be \u201csubstantially irreversible\u201d without excessive cost. But adaptive preference contexts prima facie involve exactly the erosion of such critical capacities: oppression may systematically deny education, public forums, or vocabularies for dissent, thereby neutralising procedural safeguards. Imposing those safeguards ex ante simply begs the question: agents entrenched in oppressive social processes rarely possess them. Therefore, subjectivist accounts either licence the troubling preferences or covertly smuggle in non-subjective criteria.\n\n3. Substantive or content-based accounts: autonomy as objective flourishing    \n\nContent-based theorists bite the bullet: if a preference embraces a way of living that is objectively inimical to human flourishing, it is non-autonomous no matter how sincerely endorsed. Martha Nussbaum\u2019s capabilities approach exemplifies this line: a life that voluntarily forgoes sexuality, bodily integrity, or practical reason cannot be fully human, so the preference for female genital cutting\u2014 because it mutilates sexual function and results from gender hierarchy\u2014is an adaptive, non-autonomous preference.\n\nSubstantive views straightforwardly explain the intuition that certain desires, formed under oppression, are defective. They also answer the challenge of \u201chappy slaves,\u201d who may sincerely choose bondage over risky freedom. However, two difficulties loom.\n\nFirst, paternalism. Declaring a preference non-autonomous because it fails to instantiate a capability risks disrespecting agents\u2019 own evaluative perspectives, especially in pluralistic societies. Critics accuse Nussbaum of deploying a liberal-Western template that may illegitimately override culturally specific conceptions of the good.\n\nSecond, over-breadth. Not all adapted desires are necessarily autonomy-reducing. Many adaptive preferences are benign: I may come to enjoy hiking rather than skiing after breaking my leg; resource-scarcities routinely shift aspirations without ethical loss. A content-based theory needs an extra criterion\u2014say, whether the new preference violates a threshold of objective harm\u2014before declaring it non-autonomous. But once we add such thresholds, the account begins to look less like an analysis of autonomy and more like a moral evaluation of outcomes. We risk conflating autonomy (self-government) with welfare (living well).\n\n4. Historical accounts: autonomy as freedom from illegitimate formative forces    \n\nHistorical accounts hold that a preference is autonomous only if it has not been produced by certain disqualifying kinds of causal history\u2014paradigmatically, indoctrination, manipulation, coercion, or internalised oppression. The classic source is Jon Elster\u2019s suggestion that the fox\u2019s preference does not merely change; it adapts because of \u201clack of feasible choice,\u201d and that makes it a \u201cspurious\u201d transformation. Relational autonomy theorists such as Diana Meyers, Marina Oshana, and lately Natalie Stoljar develop the idea: because persons are socially embedded, autonomy requires \u201cnon-domination\u201d in the formative domain, not merely moment-to-moment non-interference. If adaptive preferences are forged in contexts where agents could not have resisted oppressive norms, then they are less than fully self-authored.\n\nHistorical criteria elegantly diagnose why internal endorsement is insufficient. Consider Benson\u2019s case of the battered woman who has \u201clearned\u201d to believe she deserves her husband\u2019s beatings. She may sincerely reflectively endorse her submissiveness, but the endorsement traces back to systematic abuse that eroded her self-trust. The causal story, not the content per se, undermines autonomy.\n\nHistorical theories also dodge paternalism better than substantive ones because they do not pronounce certain activities (e.g., sex work, religious self-submission) inherently autonomy-vitiating. If a cloistered nun freely embraces chastity after robust opportunities for exit, the preference can be autonomous even if it rejects a capability Nussbaum cherishes. What matters is that the nun\u2019s choice was not sculpted by illegitimate social domination.\n\nStill, historical accounts face two challenges.\n\na) Path dependency without contemporaneous constraints. An oppressed group may eventually dismantle formal barriers, yet its members continue to hold preferences rooted in prior injustice. How far back must we trace causation before every preference becomes suspect? If I would not love philosophy but for the patriarchal privilege that landed me in good schools, is my love tainted?\n\nb) The possibility of autonomous self-transformation. Suppose the Sudanese woman learns of feminist arguments against cutting, weighs them, and still reaffirms her desire. A purely historical test might say the preference is non-autonomous because of its pathogenic origin, ignoring her later critical re-endorsement.\n\nTherefore, the best historical models add procedural \u201cimmunisation\u201d conditions: an agent can rehabilitate a preference by reflectively distancing from its oppressive origins in a context of substantial freedom. In Oshana\u2019s words, autonomy requires both that one\u2019s choice not be \u201coppressively shaped\u201d and that one possess \u201cthe social power to decide otherwise.\u201d\n\n5. Accounting for oppression: why adaptive preferences pose a distinctive threat    \n\nIn everyday life we adapt constantly\u2014diet, exercise, romantic tastes. Yet only some adaptations bother us. What distinguishes the worrisome cases? Oppression works through two related mechanisms:\n\n1. Information deprivation and hermeneutical marginalisation (Fricker). The agent may literally not know alternative options or may lack the interpretive resources to value them.\n\n2. Damage to self-respect and practical agency. Persistent denigration teaches the oppressed that they are unworthy of more expansive goods. This shrinks the \u201coption set\u201d in the internal sense: not merely can they not do X, they cannot even imagine themselves as the kind of people entitled to X.\n\nThese mechanisms compromise autonomy at the formative stage. Hence, our explanatory account must (a) register oppression as a historical factor, (b) explain why sincere endorsement under such conditions is insufficient, and (c) illuminate what would be required for rehabilitation. Historical-relational theories, augmented by a procedural remedy, do exactly that.\n\n6. Critiques and rejoinders    \n\nCould a subjectivist model be improved rather than abandoned? One could add a condition that endorsement must be based on \u201can adequate range of culturally meaningful options\u201d (a suggestion by Christman and by Daniel Weinstock). This move, however, slides toward historical-relational ground: the criterion is no longer purely structural but invokes social circumstances that made some options unavailable. The theory\u2019s explanatory burden shifts from the current will to the agent\u2019s social environment.\n\nCould a substantive account be trimmed so that it targets only oppression-inflicted content? Nussbaum herself sometimes pairs capabilities with a requirement that preferences formed in unjust conditions lack decisive authority. Yet content and history here intertwine: Nussbaum invokes the unjust history to explain why the choice against capability expansion lacks finality. Once again, history does explanatory work.\n\nConsider, finally, the problem of benign adaptation. My adaptation from skiing to hiking due to a broken leg involves a constraint, yet we say nothing is autonomy-reducing. Historical-relational theories explain the difference: the constraint (an injury) does not arise from domination or manipulation. Moreover, I retain epistemic access to skiing and intact self-respect. Thus, the etiology is not disqualifying.\n\n7. A hybrid historical-procedural account    \n\nThe foregoing suggests a synthesis: a preference P is non-autonomous for agent S if and only if\n\n1. Etiology: P is produced and sustained by oppressive social processes that systematically undermine S\u2019s capacities for self-respect, critical reflection, or imagination of alternatives.\n\n2. Immunisation failure: S has not, since the formation of P, had genuine opportunities to scrutinise and repudiate P under conditions of adequate information, social support, and self-trust.\n\n3. Minimal content condition: P does not involve a self-abasing valuation that annihilates S\u2019s core status as an agent (e.g., a standing disposition to accept enslavement). This clause prevents edge cases where oppressive history might produce seemingly innocuous desires but in a way that flatly contradicts agency itself.\n\nLet us test the account.\n\nCase 1: The battered woman. Her submissive preference unquestionably satisfies (1). Because the abusive relationship isolates her, (2) fails. Criterion (3) is satisfied because the preference renounces her status as an equal agent. Non-autonomous.\n\nCase 2: The nun. If she enters the convent after higher education, has freedom to exit, and retains equal civic status, condition (1) fails; thus her chastity is autonomous despite violating Nussbaum\u2019s sexual capability. Good.\n\nCase 3: The injured skier turned hiker. No oppression is involved, so (1) fails. Autonomous.\n\nCase 4: A formerly oppressed agent who later critically re-endorses the preference in a supportive environment (immunisation succeeds). Even if (1) is true, (2) fails, so the preference can regain autonomy. This captures the possibility of transformative self-authorship.\n\n8. Addressing residual worries    \n\nFirst worry: How much critical reflection is required for immunisation? We need not demand ideal rationality. Rather, we require that S have access to dissenting viewpoints, be free from immediate threats, and possess social standing sufficient for self-assertion. This is closer to \u201cgood enough\u201d autonomy\u2014parallel to \u201cgood enough\u201d parenting.\n\nSecond worry: Isn\u2019t oppression itself partially defined by outcome (restricted capabilities), thereby re-introducing content? True, but the hybrid account treats capability deprivation as evidence of oppression, not as the locus of autonomy failure. If the deprivation occurred accidentally (say, a natural disaster), the etiological criterion distinguishes the case from systemic domination.\n\nThird worry: What about collective adaptive preferences\u2014e.g., cultural groups that valorise female circumcision? The account holds individuals non-autonomous if their personal formation involved oppressive gender dynamics. However, it allows that communal endorsement may, in principle, become autonomous if the practice evolves absent gender hierarchy. Critics will say true elimination of hierarchy would change the practice\u2019s meaning: the hybrid account predicts that too, showing its interpretive bite.\n\n9. Comparative upshot    \n\nTo summarise the comparative virtues:\n\nSubjectivist/procedural accounts capture the agent\u2019s own voice but underestimate background distortions.\n\nContent-based accounts spotlight objective harm but risk paternalism and overbreadth.\n\nHistorical-relational accounts diagnose social domination but need supplementation to allow rehabilitation and prevent over-scepticism.\n\nThe hybrid view integrates the strengths: it respects the agent\u2019s potential for reflective self-revision (procedural), acknowledges the moral reality of oppression as a causal force (historical), and secures a minimal threshold that preserves personhood (content, but modest). Thus it best explains why adaptive preferences under oppression are less than fully autonomous.\n\n10. Conclusion    \n\nAdaptive preferences challenge any theory of autonomy that focuses solely on contemporaneous consent or on ideal lists of goods. They remind us that human willing is historically situated and vulnerable to social power. In oppressive contexts, people\u2019s very desires can become complicit in their domination; yet respecting persons means we cannot simply disregard what they say they want. A historically informed, relational conception\u2014tempered by procedural and minimal substantive considerations\u2014navigates this tension. It diagnoses the autonomy deficit of oppressive adaptive preferences, explains why some adaptations are harmless, and preserves agents\u2019 capacity to reclaim authorship over their own lives. By attending both to the causal past and to the ongoing possibilities for critical self-formation, such an account honours the complexity of autonomy in a world where freedom must be continuously (re)made.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 3, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 3521, "reasoning_tokens": 256}

Introduction  \n\nSuppose a girl raised in a highly patriarchal rural district of Nepal sincerely tells development workers that she does not want to finish school; she prefers to marry at fourteen, perform household labour, and bear children early. Her preference is not the product of an immediate threat or explicit coercion. Rather, years of socialisation, a dearth of female role-models with alternative careers, and the material insecurity of her family have gradually shaped her outlook until \u201cearly marriage\u201d presents itself as the natural and even desirable course of life. Many people have the intuitive reaction that something is amiss. The girl\u2019s preference is, in Jon Elster\u2019s terminology, adaptive: it has been adjusted \u201cdownwards\u201d to fit a restricted and oppressive feasibility set. Yet the preference is also, in an ordinary sense, volitional: the girl herself voices and even endorses it. How, then, should philosophers explain the apparent autonomy deficit that adaptive preferences (APs) exhibit?\n\nThree broad families of autonomy theories dominate the literature.\n\nA. Subjectivist or structural accounts (paradigmatically Harry Frankfurt\u2019s hierarchical model) ground autonomy in the agent\u2019s internal reflective relation to her own motivational set: a desire is autonomous when the agent endorses it upon higher-order reflection.\n\nB. Content-based or substantive accounts judge a preference autonomous only if what is preferred crosses a threshold of moral or prudential value. Martha Nussbaum\u2019s capabilities approach is the most influential contemporary instance.\n\nC. Historical or procedural accounts focus on how the preference was formed. If it arose through a process of manipulation, coercion, or severely constrained imaginative horizons, the preference is autonomy-undermining even if the agent now endorses it.\n\nWhich of these frameworks best diagnoses the autonomy deficit of adaptive preferences, especially those formed under conditions of oppression? I shall argue that historical accounts provide the most compelling explanation, though they must be supplemented by a modest substantive constraint to avoid certain counter-examples. Subjectivist models misclassify many adaptive preferences as fully autonomous because they privilege present-time endorsement, whereas purely content-based models conflate autonomy with well-being and invite paternalism. Historical models, by contrast, locate the deficiency in the impaired genesis of the preference\u2014an impairment that is both morally salient and compatible with a recognisably liberal respect for persons.\n\n2. The phenomenon of adaptive preference  \n\nElster introduced APs with Aesop\u2019s fox, who concludes that the inaccessible grapes were probably sour anyway. Amartya Sen and Nussbaum extended the notion to real-world deprivation: the poor who report not needing adequate shelter, women who profess indifference to political participation, the chronically ill who rate their health highly. Two features define these cases.\n\n1. Constraint responsiveness: the preference arises in response to limited, often oppressive, options.\n2. Internalisation: once formed, the preference is sincerely held and can guide action without ongoing external pressure.\n\nBecause the preference is internally endorsed yet shaped by constraints, it occupies a liminal space between compulsion and free choice. Development economists worry that using expressed preferences to measure welfare will systematically undercount the harms of deprivation; political theorists worry that empowerment policies will be blocked by the very people they are meant to help. Underlying these practical issues is a philosophical one: in what sense are such preferences, and the actions they motivate, less than fully autonomous?\n\n3. Subjectivist or hierarchical accounts  \n\nFrankfurt\u2019s model distinguishes first-order desires (to do or have something) from second-order desires (to have or be moved by certain first-order desires). Autonomy consists in wholehearted identification: an agent is free when she wants what she wants to want. An analogue is Gerald Dworkin\u2019s \u201cauthenticity\u201d test, which also centres on reflective endorsement. What verdict does this family deliver about APs?\n\na. Strength: It focuses on the agent\u2019s point of view and avoids imposing external values.\nb. Problem: Many adaptive preferences are, by hypothesis, reflectively endorsed. The Nepali girl envisages marriage and genuinely embraces it as her ideal. Hierarchical endorsement, therefore, risks labelling the preference fully autonomous.\n\nDefenders reply that endorsement must be \u201cinformed\u201d or that higher-order desires must themselves be free from manipulation. But once such historical considerations enter, the view ceases to be purely structural and edges toward the third family. Frankfurt deliberately eschewed those additions: his account was designed for cases like the unwilling addict, where the agent\u2019s own higher-order will conflicts with the first-order craving. It is ill equipped for socialisation cases in which all hierarchical levels converge on the same desire.\n\nA more sophisticated subjectivist strategy emphasises imaginative constraints. Diana Tietjens Meyers argues that autonomy involves an \u201cautonomous competency\u201d to generate and criticise plans of life; oppression truncates the imaginative repertoire. Unfortunately, competence theories cannot easily explain why some victims of oppression\u2014who demonstrably possess great imaginative powers\u2014nonetheless adapt their preferences. Conversely, people living under egalitarian conditions but with modest imaginative resources need not thereby lack autonomy.\n\nIn short, purely subjectivist models either (a) misclassify many APs as autonomous or (b) smuggle in historical criteria that belong to a different explanatory family. They therefore do not best illuminate the autonomy deficit in question.\n\n4. Content-based accounts  \n\nNussbaum\u2019s capabilities approach treats a life as truly human only if the person enjoys opportunities to exercise ten central capabilities: bodily integrity, practical reason, political voice, etc. When someone prefers a life that falls below the threshold\u2014say, endorses female genital cutting on cultural grounds\u2014the preference is judged nonautonomous because it contradicts objective human flourishing.\n\nThis move captures our intuition in certain dramatic cases. It also yields clear policy guidance: expand people\u2019s capability sets even if they say they do not want them. Yet several objections press hard.\n\na. Autonomy conflated with well-being. A person might autonomously choose a life of self-sacrifice, subsistence simplicity, or religious asceticism. If the content is the decisive criterion, such choices must be ruled heteronomous\u2014and that seems wrong.\n\nb. Epistemic humility. Outsiders may err in their assessment of what counts as true human functioning. The charge of \u201cpaternalism\u201d is especially acute when cultural difference is at stake. Nussbaum tries to blunt the objection by focusing on very basic capabilities, but disagreement persists even at that level (e.g., over the value of political participation).\n\nc. Explaining, not stipulating, the autonomy deficit. Content-based views risk circularity: why is the woman\u2019s preference regarding genital cutting nonautonomous? Because it endorses an objectively bad practice. But why think autonomy hinges on objective good? The account offers little explanation beyond asserting a necessary link.\n\nOne might retort that autonomy has always contained a substantive dimension\u2014consider Kant\u2019s \u201cgiving oneself the moral law.\u201d Yet adopting this Kantian lineage in the context of APs erases the distinctiveness of the adaptive-preference critique, which is that the mechanism of social oppression distorts choice independently of the intrinsic badness of what is chosen. For these reasons, content-based views, though normatively attractive to some, are not the best explanation of why APs are autonomy-deficient.\n\n5. Historical or procedural accounts  \n\nHistorical theories ground autonomy in an agent\u2019s freedom from particular types of causal history: manipulation, coercion, disinformation, or severe socialisation that bypasses the agent\u2019s critical faculties. Sarah Buss, Marina Oshana, Natalie Stoljar, Susan Babbitt, and Paul Benson develop variants; Serene Khader\u2019s \u201cdeliberative perfectionism\u201d is a recent contribution tailored to global gender oppression.\n\nHow do historical accounts fare with APs?\n\na. They accommodate endorsement. The key move is to distinguish between the agent\u2019s current endorsement and the conditions under which the endorsed preference was acquired. The Nepali girl\u2019s wholehearted identification does not automatically confer autonomy because her preference emerged in a context of structural domination that systematically limited her imaginative horizons and rewarded internalised subservience.\n\nb. They respect pluralism. Historical accounts do not rule out unconventional life plans per se; they only scrutinise the processes by which such plans took shape. If a person, after wide exposure and critical reflection, chooses ascetic monasticism, that choice can be autonomous even if it flouts mainstream ideals of flourishing.\n\nc. They match our ordinary explanatory judgments. When we say a cult member is \u201cbrainwashed,\u201d we point to the manipulative techniques that fostered the commitment, not merely to the content of the commitment or to the absence of second-order conflict. Analogously, patriarchal socialisation, restricted education, and economic dependence can be seen as \u201csoft brainwashing.\u201d\n\nTwo further arguments reinforce the historical diagnosis.\n\n1. Dependence on an artificially narrowed feasibility set. Consider Amartya Sen\u2019s \u201ccapability deprivation.\u201d The formation of desires is itself sensitive to the range of live options the agent encounters. When the range is unjustly limited, the resulting preference formation process is epistemically defective: it proceeds from a systematically biased sample of options. These epistemic defects are historically traceable to oppression.\n\n2. Internalised deference. Studies in social psychology (e.g., stereotype threat, implicit bias) reveal mechanisms by which members of disadvantaged groups come to devalue their own aspirations. These mechanisms operate over time and below the level of conscious endorsement. A historical criterion is uniquely positioned to capture their sub-agential yet formative effects.\n\nObjections to historical accounts  \n\ni. Overbreadth. Virtually every preference is shaped by some social history. Does that mean almost no preference is fully autonomous? Historical theorists reply by distinguishing ordinary causal influence from domination. Natalie Stoljar introduces the idea of a \u201cbasic legitimacy condition\u201d: only histories involving \u201coppressive socialisation\u201d undermine autonomy. Drawing this boundary is challenging but not impossible: it hinges on patterns of power, systemic disadvantage, and the intentional perpetuation of stereotypes.\n\nii. Autonomy as lifetime process, not momentary property. If autonomy requires an immaculate pedigree, perhaps no adult could ever redeem early-acquired preferences. Benson answers with the notion of \u201cself-appropriation.\u201d Agents can retrospectively interrogate, reinterpret, and sometimes repudiate nonautonomous desires, thereby making them their own. What matters is not purity but the absence of unresisted domination at the time of endorsement, given realistic opportunities for critical reflection. When oppression has destroyed such opportunities, the historical deficit persists.\n\niii. Need for minimal substantive floor. Suppose a preference is formed through oppressive means yet happens to promote the agent\u2019s well-being. Is it still nonautonomous? Historical accounts say yes. Critics find this counter-intuitive: if the agent is both happy and reflectively content, why insist on nonautonomy? I think the worry is less potent than it first appears. Autonomy is a value distinct from happiness; its loss remains morally salient even when the agent is content\u2014indeed, that is precisely the tragedy of adaptive preference.\n\nNevertheless, a purely procedural view could, in principle, validate a sadistic preference provided it formed in a pristine deliberative environment. That suggests adding a weak content\u2010constraint: the preference must at least be compatible with the basic moral status of others (e.g., not to torture innocents). Such a hybrid still assigns primary explanatory weight to history; it merely blocks extreme cases that any theory of autonomy should rule out.\n\n6. Comparative assessment  \n\nLet us pit the three accounts directly against four desiderata:\n\n1. Explains why endorsement by the agent is not enough.  \n2. Distinguishes autonomy from welfare/paternalism concerns.  \n3. Respects cultural pluralism while critiquing oppression.  \n4. Fits everyday explanatory practices about indoctrination, brainwashing, and socialisation.\n\nSubjectivist accounts satisfy 3 but fail 1 and partly 4. Content-based accounts satisfy 1 and perhaps 4 but fail 2 and 3. Historical accounts satisfy 1, 2, and 4 while balancing 3 by avoiding substantive perfectionism. Hence historical accounts best meet the explanatory demands.\n\n7. Implications for policy and moral responsibility  \n\nIf the primary autonomy deficit lies in the history of formation, then remedial measures should prioritise:\n\na. Expanding genuine options: education, economic independence, legal rights.  \nb. Facilitating critical reflection: public deliberation, consciousness-raising, safe spaces for dissent.  \nc. Respecting agency through time: interventions should aim to widen horizons, not replace one set of imposed ends with another. Empowerment programmes that expose the Nepali girl to alternative life stories, provide scholarships, and legally protect her choice to delay marriage exemplify historically-sensitive policy.\n\nWhat about moral responsibility? If a woman has internalised sexist norms and therefore chooses an exploitative relationship, is she blameworthy? Historical accounts yield a nuanced answer: her action flows from a preference that is partially nonautonomous; she is therefore less than fully responsible. The primary moral fault lies with the social structures and agents that perpetuate the oppressive conditions.\n\n8. Conclusion  \n\nAdaptive preferences illustrate a poignant philosophical tension. On the one hand, liberalism grounds respect in each person\u2019s own evaluative standpoint. On the other, we recognise that power systematically shapes those standpoints, sometimes to the detriment of the very people who hold them. Subjectivist theories, by focusing on current internal endorsement, neglect the distorting forces that scaffold many of our deepest desires. Content-based theories, by focusing on the objective merits of what is chosen, collapse autonomy into a form of perfectionism. Historical accounts, while not flawless, capture the crucial insight: autonomy is diachronic. It is a capacity to author one\u2019s life across time, and that capacity can be vitiated when the formative stages of preference acquisition are colonised by oppression. Diagnosing adaptive preferences as historically nonautonomous preserves respect for persons, explains our intuitions about responsibility, and guides emancipatory practice toward expanding real, critically assessable possibilities rather than merely overriding expressed choices.  \n\nApproximately 2,050 words.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 4, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 3528, "reasoning_tokens": 576}

Introduction  \n\nIn the now-classic parable told by Jon Elster, a fox, unable to reach a bunch of grapes hanging enticingly above his head, concludes that they must in fact be sour and therefore not worth wanting.  The moral is familiar: human beings, too, sometimes reshuffle their desires so that what is out of reach comes to appear undesirable.  Amartya Sen, Martha Nussbaum, Serene Khader and many feminist theorists have argued that such \u201cadaptive\u201d or \u201cdeformed\u201d preferences present a special threat to autonomy whenever the narrowing of one\u2019s aspirations is induced by poverty, patriarchy, racial hierarchy, or other systematic constraint.  Yet it is surprisingly difficult to say exactly why an adapted preference is less than fully one\u2019s own.  Is the problem that the agent fails to **identify** with the preference at some higher\u2010order level, as Harry Frankfurt\u2019s subjectivist theory would require?  Is the problem, as perfectionists and capability theorists suggest, that the **content** of the preference falls below some objective threshold of human flourishing?  Or does the deficit reside, primarily, in the **history** of how the preference was produced?  \n\nAfter briefly clarifying what adaptive preferences are (\u00a72), I examine the three main families of autonomy theories that attempt to diagnose what is wrong with them (\u00a73\u20135).  I argue that neither purely subjectivist nor purely content-based accounts fully capture the sense in which oppression can compromise self-rule.  The former ignores how oppressive socialisation can infiltrate even higher-order volitions; the latter risks disrespecting agents by discounting their self-reports whenever they diverge from an external ideal.  A historically sensitive approach is therefore indispensable (\u00a76).  Still, a wholly historical account cannot do all the work either, for a defective genesis is not *in itself* enough to show that the agent\u2019s present standpoint lacks authority.  I therefore defend a **hybrid diagnosis** (\u00a77): adaptive preferences manifest a deficit of autonomy when (i) their formation involved illegitimate constraints that bypassed the agent\u2019s critical capacities in ways she would, under reflection, disavow, *and* (ii) that non-reflective genesis continues to impair her deliberative capacities in the present.  Oppression matters twice\u2014first in the causal history and again in the ongoing deliberative situation\u2014which explains why merely *subjective* endorsement or objectively *valuable* content is not sufficient to restore full self-government.\n\n2. Defining Adaptive Preferences  \n\nSen: \u201cThe deprivations of childhood can narrow the horizon of aspirations.\u201d  In the socio-economic literature, an *adaptive preference* is a preference formed or reshaped in response to a limited opportunity set that makes better options practically or psychologically inaccessible.  Prototypical cases:  \n\n\u2022 A girl socialised in a patriarchal community \u201cprefers\u201d early marriage and foregoes schooling.  \n\u2022 A landless laborer reports being \u201csatisfied\u201d with 1 USD a day because he cannot imagine alternative forms of life.  \n\u2022 A victim of domestic violence develops an attachment to her abusive partner, rationalising male domination as romantic devotion.  \n\nTwo features distinguish adaptive preferences from innocent cases of learning or maturation.  First, the **constraint** is *systemic*, often the upshot of injustice.  Second, the agent\u2019s preference is thought to be **suboptimal**\u2014either for her well-being or for her status as an autonomous agent.  The challenge is to vindicate this \u201cless than fully autonomous\u201d verdict without erasing the agent\u2019s own voice.\n\n3. Subjectivist (Hierarchy-of-Desires) Accounts  \n\nThe Frankfurtian model treats autonomy as a matter of **structure**: an action is free when it proceeds from a first-order desire (D1) that the agent endorses at a higher level (D2), and when this endorsement itself is not alienated.  On this view, an adapted preference such as \u201cI want to marry at 14\u201d would be autonomous if the young girl also *wants to want* this and has no higher-order reservations.\n\n3.1 Why subjectivism seems promising  \n\u2022 It explains the apparent difference between mere conditioning (the reflex fear of dogs after a bite) and reflective endorsement (choosing vegetarianism after considering moral reasons).  \n\u2022 It respects agents\u2019 self-reports and avoids paternalism: if a woman loves her veil and also loves loving her veil, who are we to object?\n\n3.2 Why subjectivism struggles with oppression  \n\u2022 **Infiltrated reflection**: Oppressive socialisation can shape not only first-order but second-order desires.  American slaves internalised narratives of racial inferiority; battered women may feel they *ought* to stay.  Nothing in Frankfurt\u2019s formal model disqualifies such higher-order endorsements.  \n\u2022 **Historical amnesia**: Because the test is synchronic (look at which desires are endorsed *now*), the model is blind to whether endorsement resulted from gas-lighting or coercive inculcation.  \n\u2022 **Power asymmetry**: Hierarchical endorsement can itself be produced by fear of sanction or the absence of alternative scripts, yet appear genuine from the inside.  Thus, subjectivism risks re-inscribing domination: people endorse what they were forced to want because they could not afford\u2014psychologically or materially\u2014to do otherwise.\n\n4. Content-Based Accounts  \n\nPerfectionist liberals and capability theorists judge autonomy by reference to the **substance** of the choice.  Nussbaum, for instance, lists capabilities such as bodily integrity, education, leisure, and political participation.  A preference to refuse schooling or to submit to marital rape is deemed non-autonomous not because the agent fails to endorse it, but because the content violates objective standards of human flourishing.\n\n4.1 Appeal of content standards  \n\u2022 **Protects minimal dignity**: One can condemn foot-binding or female genital cutting whether or not participants profess consent.  \n\u2022 **Explains moral disquiet**: Our intuition that a seven-year-old coal miner does not autonomously choose hazardous labour seems driven by the belief that no child should work in mines, period.\n\n4.2 Problems with purely content-based tests  \n\u2022 **Paternalism and disrespect**: If autonomy status turns solely on external value judgments, the agent\u2019s own viewpoint is epistemically sidelined.  This echoes colonial \u201ccivilising missions.\u201d  \n\u2022 **Heterogeneity of values**: Reasonable people may prefer asceticism, celibacy, or high-risk activism.  A stringent capability list would misclassify such life plans as non-autonomous.  \n\u2022 **False positive risk**: A woman who voluntarily chooses modest dress for religious reasons could be wrongly suspected of adaptive preference simply because the outcome is disfavoured by Western liberals.\n\n5. Historical Accounts  \n\nHistorical or procedural theories look to **how** the preference was produced.  Gerald Dworkin, John Christman and Marina Oshana argue that autonomy requires the absence of *alienating* causal influences, e.g., brainwashing, deception, and coercion.  Christman\u2019s \u201creflection-condition\u201d adds that the agent would not disavow the causal history were it known; Oshana underlines the need for adequate social relationships and status.\n\n5.1 Strengths  \n\u2022 Captures our sense that *genealogy matters*: The same preference (say, wearing a headscarf) may be autonomous when formed in a supportive religious community and heteronomous when inculcated by threats.  \n\u2022 Avoids *content chauvinism*: It is compatible with a wide plurality of ends, provided they were arrived at non-oppressively.  \n\u2022 Explains why *internal endorsement* may not suffice: Endorsement achieved through gas-lighting is historically compromised.\n\n5.2 Difficulties  \n\u2022 **Specification problem**: Which causal routes are autonomy-undermining? Socialisation is ubiquitous; where to draw the line between normal upbringing and subverting indoctrination?  \n\u2022 **Temporally distant oppression**: What if the unjust origin lies generations back? Many career preferences are shaped by gender-typing from early childhood, yet we hesitate to deem every gendered desire non-autonomous.  \n\u2022 **No present-day check**: A preference might have been initially imposed coercively, yet over time the agent has appropriated it as her own through critical reflection.  Purely historical accounts struggle to rehabilitate such cases.\n\n6. Why Oppression Calls for a Historical Dimension  \n\nThe phenomenon of **adaptive preference formation** is intimately historical: constraints channel not only options but imagination, scripting self-conceptions and shaping which desires even *occur* to a person.  Subjectivist and content accounts both mis-locate the locus of domination:  \n\n\u2022 Subjectivists, focusing on present-time endorsement, overlook *structural path-dependency*.  Shiffrin\u2019s notion of \u201cperverse incentive\u2010effects\u201d shows how persistent deprivation forces people to recalibrate ambitions downward to preserve psychic equilibrium.  Their endorsements are not free from influence but soaked in it.  \n\n\u2022 Content theorists, by contrast, risk hammering heterogenous lives into a single ideal form, treating every deviation from the template as defective.  Yet some deviations owe not to oppression but to inventive self-authorship.  The historical gaze is needed to tell the difference.\n\n7. Toward a Hybrid Diagnosis  \n\nI propose that adaptive preferences exhibit an autonomy deficit when two conditions jointly hold:\n\nA. **Illegitimate Genesis Condition (IGC)**: The preference emerged through social mechanisms\u2014coercion, manipulation, or deprivation\u2014that bypassed or stunted the agent\u2019s capacity for critical reflection, imagination, or experimentation in ways that she would, under conditions of adequate information and support, reject as disempowering.\n\nB. **Ongoing Impairment Condition (OIC)**: The historical process continues to disrupt the agent\u2019s current deliberative capacities, either by restricting access to alternatives, by instilling affective attachments that drown out critical assessment, or by maintaining social penalties for deviation.\n\nBoth conditions are necessary.  If only IGC holds (the initial formation was tainted) but the agent has since *re-worked* the preference through sustained reflection in a context where she could realistically revise or exit\u2014a possibility captured by \u201cautonomy through adaptive preference conversion\u201d (Khader)\u2014then the preference can regain authority.  Conversely, if only OIC holds (the agent currently faces constraints) but the preference was (improbably) formed independently of those constraints, the charge of adaptation would misfire.\n\n7.1 Why this hybrid clarifies classic cases  \n\na) Early marriage under patriarchy:  \n\u2022 Genesis: social expectations, dowry economics, and lack of schooling stifle imagination (IGC satisfied).  \n\u2022 Ongoing: reputational sanctions, economic dependency make exit costly (OIC satisfied).  \n=> Autonomy deficit pronounced.\n\nb) Religious vow of poverty in a monastery:  \n\u2022 Genesis: voluntary entry at adulthood after exposure to multiple life paths; spiritual deliberation (IGC fails).  \n\u2022 Ongoing: communal norms restrict options but systems for dispensation exist; exit rights (OIC may fail).  \n=> Likely autonomous even though content resembles deprivation.\n\nc) Secular woman later choosing the veil upon conversion:  \n\u2022 Genesis: process may involve robust discussion and study (IGC fails).  \n\u2022 Ongoing: If she lives in a liberal society where unveiling is costless, OIC fails.  \n=> Autonomy intact; suspicion of adaptation unwarranted.\n\nd) Stockholm syndrome of kidnap victim:  \n\u2022 Genesis: coercive captivity, fear (IGC).  \n\u2022 Ongoing: Psychological trauma still colours judgments (OIC).  \n=> Strong autonomy deficit.\n\n7.2 Relation to competing theories  \n\n\u2022 Frankfurtian endorsement remains *relevant* under OIC, since current identification matters; but it is *not sufficient* without the freedom-enhancing background that ensures endorsement is more than an echo of domination.  \n\n\u2022 Content standards play a **protective fallback** role: when both IGC and OIC are opaque, flagrantly harmful content (torture, mutilation) raises a defeasible presumption of adaptation.  Yet content alone can be overridden by a clear non-oppressive history plus present deliberative competence (e.g., voluntary asceticism).  \n\n\u2022 Historical conditions are **primary** because they trace the moral fault lines that oppression engraves on agency.  \n\n8. Objections and Replies  \n\nObjection 1:  \u201cThe hybrid collapses into paternalism whenever the theorist claims the agent *would* reject the genesis under reflection.\u201d  \nReply:  The counterfactual employed in IGC is *procedural*, not value-laden.  It asks whether the agent, furnished with full information and shielded from sanction, would disavow the manipulative route, not whether she would choose a liberal lifestyle.  The test relies on *interpretive charity* and *dialogue*, privileging the agent\u2019s own CIP\u2014counter-factually ideal preferences\u2014rather than the theorist\u2019s ideals.\n\nObjection 2:  \u201cEven deprived agents can make genuinely transformative choices; you underestimate resilience.\u201d  \nReply:  The hybrid acknowledges this through the possibility of autonomy restoration: where agents re-appropriate inherited desires through critical engagement, OIC may cease to hold.  The view is thus dynamic, not fatalistic.\n\nObjection 3:  \u201cWhy not drop OIC and treat all tainted histories as permanently autonomy-destroying?\u201d  \nReply:  Such \u201cstain\u201d theories cannot explain moral growth and self-reclamation.  Victims of brainwashing can and do deprogram themselves; religious converts can own their faith despite childhood indoctrination.  Autonomy is not a one-shot status but a capacity that can be regained.\n\n9. Practical Implications  \n\nThe analysis has implications for development policy and feminist activism.  If adaptive preferences harbour an autonomy deficit only when both historical taint and ongoing impairment persist, interventions should focus not on *over-riding* stated preferences but on *expanding* the social space for critical reflection and exit.  Examples:  \n\n\u2022 Conditional cash transfers to girls\u2019 families, delaying early marriage long enough to make school attendance imaginable.  \n\u2022 Shelters and legal aid that reduce the material costs of leaving abusive relationships.  \n\u2022 Participatory workshops where women articulate aspirations collectively, thereby widening the deliberative horizon.\n\nSuch measures respect present agency while tackling the mechanisms that keep OIC alive.  They avoid the twin dangers of (i) romanticising oppressed people\u2019s adaptive contentment and (ii) coercively imposing external goals.\n\n10. Conclusion  \n\nAdaptive preferences are not autonomous simply because the agent inwardly endorses them, nor because they deviate from an objective vision of the good.  Their autonomy is fragile because they are the *products* and the *perpetuators* of social mechanisms that suffocate critical capacities.  A historically informed, yet forward-looking, account best captures this fragility: it reveals how domination can get under the skin, shaping what people want and what they can imagine wanting, and it shows that liberation consists not in substituting new content but in dismantling the constraints that keep imagination cramped.  Autonomy, on this view, is not a pristine interior citadel but a living practice sustained by social conditions.  Only when those conditions allow agents to scrutinise, revise, and possibly affirm their own histories can preferences\u2014however unconventional\u2014be truly said to be their own.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 5, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 3430, "reasoning_tokens": 128}

Consider whether subjectivist accounts (such as Frankfurt's hierarchical model of desire endorsement), content-based accounts (which evaluate the moral quality of what is preferred), or historical accounts (which examine how the preference was formed) best explain the autonomy deficit that adaptive preferences seem to exhibit, particularly in cases of oppression.", "answer": "1. Introduction  \n\nWhen Amartya Sen asks why so many Indian women report that they \u201cdo not need\u201d more food than their husbands, or when Jon Elster recalls Aesop\u2019s fox who comes to believe that the grapes he cannot reach are sour, we are immediately drawn to a puzzle about autonomy.  These women and the fox appear to choose voluntarily; no one is twisting their arms.  Yet the choices do not strike us as fully free.  We call such attitudes adaptive preferences: they are preferences that have come into being \u2013 or have hardened \u2013 in response to the limited and often unjust options the agent confronts.  The philosophical question is what, exactly, accounts for the felt deficit in autonomy.      \n\nThree broad families of answers dominate the literature:\n\n\u2022\u2003Subjectivist or \u201cendorsement\u201d views, epitomised by Harry Frankfurt\u2019s hierarchical model, hold that a desire is autonomous if the agent wholeheartedly endorses it upon reflectively identifying with it.  \n\n\u2022\u2003Content-based views claim that certain things must not be preferred, or must at least be dispreferred, if the agent is to count as self-governing; when the content of a preference is morally objectionable or self-demeaning, the preference is ipso facto non-autonomous.  \n\n\u2022\u2003Historical views trace autonomy to the right sort of genesis: a preference is autonomous only if it arises through processes that do not involve coercion, manipulation, or oppressive socialisation.  \n\nMy aim is to assess which of these approaches best captures what goes wrong in paradigmatic cases of adaptive preference under oppression.  I will argue that purely subjectivist models underestimate the way structural deprivation infiltrates reflection, that content-based models collapse into objectionable perfectionism, and that historical-relational models, suitably refined, offer the most compelling diagnosis.  The autonomy deficit of adaptive preferences is primarily a matter of how\u2014under what social and psychological conditions\u2014the preference is formed and sustained, rather than merely of current endorsement or of objectionable content.  However, historical accounts must be supplemented with procedural elements if they are to avoid a regress and do justice to meaningful exercises of deliberative agency.  A hybrid \u201crelational-historical proceduralism\u201d provides the best explanation.  \n\n2. Adaptive Preference and the Idea of Autonomy  \n\nAn adaptive preference is not just any preference that changes in light of new information.  If I like light roast coffee until I am introduced to dark roast and come to favour it, nothing worrisome has occurred.  What makes a preference adaptively suspect, following Sen and Martha Nussbaum, is that the adaptation aims at coping with a deprived or oppressive feasibility set.  Agents shrink their aspirations to avoid the pain of desiring what they cannot reasonably hope to secure.  The result is often what Khader calls \u201cinternalised oppression\u201d: an endorsement of arrangements that harm the agent\u2019s own flourishing.  \n\nAutonomy, on the other hand, is ordinarily taken to involve self-rule: roughly, an autonomous action or preference is one that is truly one\u2019s own, appropriately responsive to one\u2019s deeper values, immune from dominating external or internal pressures, and formed and sustained through capacities of critical reflection.  Many theorists add social conditions\u2014equality, non-domination\u2014that must obtain if the capacities are to function unimpeded.  Measuring adaptive preferences against this multidimensional ideal, we strongly suspect that something is awry.  The question is where, exactly, the deviation occurs.  \n\n3. The Subjectivist (Hierarchical) Account  \n\nFrankfurt\u2019s familiar model imagines a hierarchy of motivational states: first-order desires (to eat, to drink, to submit to one\u2019s husband) and second-order desires or volitions (to want to want, to act upon, or to resist those first-order desires).  Autonomy emerges when the agent identifies with a first-order desire by forming a corresponding, wholehearted second-order volition.  If Fatima sincerely and reflectively endorses her desire to eat less than her husband, Frankfurt would have to deem the desire autonomous.  \n\n3.1 Strengths  \n\nSubjectivism captures the intimate connection between autonomy and identification.  An agent who is psychologically torn or alienated from her desires lacks self-rule.  Moreover, subjectivism respects the agent\u2019s perspective: it avoids paternalism by refusing to substitute an external value ranking for the agent\u2019s own.  \n\n3.2 Difficulties with Adaptive Preferences  \n\na. The problem of \u201chappy slaves.\u201d  Genuine endorsement is compatible with entrenched oppression.  A slave might have been socialised so thoroughly that her reflectively endorsed desire is to serve.  Frankfurt offers no machinery for distinguishing wholeheartedness induced by subtle domination from wholeheartedness that expresses genuine self-constitution.  \n\nb. The opacity of endorsement.  For Frankfurt, what matters is sincere, wholehearted identification.  But the concept of wholeheartedness is empirically elusive.  How do we tell whether endorsement is itself the product of indoctrination?  \n\nc. Explanatory inertness.  Subjectivism struggles to explain why adaptive preferences bother us in ways ordinary preference changes do not.  If both result in wholehearted endorsement, both should enjoy the same autonomous standing.  Yet we intuitively feel that the fox\u2019s reflective endorsement (\u201cthose grapes are probably sour anyway\u201d) is less free than the coffee aficionado\u2019s newly acquired taste.  \n\n3.3 Possible Repairs and Their Limits  \n\nSome subjectivists develop higher-order, more demanding reflective tests, adding conditions of ideal information or extended critical scrutiny.  But these manoeuvres either threaten an infinite regress (for each reflective level a further level of endorsement is demanded) or surreptitiously import historical criteria (\u201cthe reflection must not be constrained by oppressive conditions\u201d), thereby conceding the point to historical theories.  \n\n4. Content-Based Accounts  \n\nHere autonomy is tied to the substantive moral quality of the ends chosen.  Isaiah Berlin condemned the idea as paternalistic, but philosophers from Raz to Nussbaum to Self-Determination Theory\u2019s psychologists have defended \u201cperfectionist\u201d or \u201cobjective goods\u201d approaches.  Preferences are non-autonomous, on this view, when they favour activities or roles inconsistent with human flourishing, self-respect, or basic capabilities.  \n\n4.1 Explanatory Payoff  \n\nContent-based accounts can readily explain the bad taste in our mouths when we hear an Afghan girl say she prefers not to be educated: she prefers something that stunts her fundamental capability for practical reason.  The moral repugnance tracks the autonomy judgment: wanting servitude is non-autonomous because servitude is wrong.  \n\n4.2 Worries About Perfectionism and Over-Breadth  \n\na. Paternalism redivivus.  To declare preferences non-autonomous because we deem their content suboptimal is to override the agent\u2019s own evaluative standpoint.  Even if such overriding is sometimes justified, it is not the same thing as diagnosing an absence of self-governance.  A smoker who fully understands the health consequences and still loves cigarettes may be irrational, but it is not obvious she is heteronomous.  \n\nb. The category error.  Autonomy is a structural property of agency, whereas moral goodness is a property of outcomes or acts.  Conflating the two risks blunting both notions.  \n\nc. Counter-examples.  Some adaptive preferences are morally innocuous.  The fox\u2019s newly acquired indifference to grapes harms no one, yet we still sense a freedom deficit.  Conversely, morally troubling content sometimes results from fully autonomous exploration (consider the stoic who, after reflection, embraces severe self-denial).  Not every harmful preference is non-autonomous.  \n\nHence a purely content-based test cannot reliably track autonomy.  \n\n5. Historical Accounts  \n\nHistorical theories, pioneered by Gerald Dworkin, Alfred Mele, and more recently Marina Oshana and Natalie Stoljar, shift focus from present-time endorsement or content to the way a preference came about.  A preference is autonomous if it originates, and is sustained, through processes free from coercion, deception, indoctrination, or oppressive socialisation.  Both causal and normative variants exist.  On a causal version, manipulation and coercion break the appropriate causal chain; on a normative variant, a preference is autonomous only if it arises in conditions of relational equality that express the agent\u2019s standing as a free and equal member of the moral community.  \n\n5.1 Why the Historical Lens Fits Adaptive Preferences  \n\na. Diagnostic power.  What is disturbing about Sen\u2019s famished women is not merely that they currently endorse eating little; it is that their endorsement results from a lifetime of nutritional deprivation and patriarchal messaging.  The autonomy deficit tracks the distorted history.  \n\nb. Relational sensitivity.  Oppression is, by definition, a relational phenomenon: one group dominates another.  Historical-relational accounts accommodate this fact, whereas subjectivist and content-based theories treat agents as largely self-enclosed.  \n\nc. Avoiding overt perfectionism.  A historical theory can condemn the preference\u2019s genesis without having to declare the content intrinsically disvaluable.  Even innocuous contents (disliking grapes) can be non-autonomous if produced by illegitimate constraints.  \n\n5.2 Challenges and Refinements  \n\nYet history alone cannot settle everything.  First, the concept of \u201coppressive influence\u201d must be specified: at what threshold does cultural shaping become autonomy-threatening?  Second, causal history pressures eventually end; at some point the agent might critically scrutinise and reaffirm her adaptive preference.  Does the preference thereby regain autonomy?  If so, the view threatens to collapse back into a subjectivist endorsement model; if not, it risks disempowering agents by eternally disqualifying any preference once tainted.  \n\nA promising refinement draws on relational theories of autonomy (Oshana, Mackenzie).  They hold that current autonomy depends not solely on causal history but on whether the social conditions continue to allow the agent adequate opportunities for self-critical revision.  If oppressive structures persist, the agent\u2019s ongoing endorsement remains suspect.  If those structures disappear and the agent, under non-oppressive conditions, reendorses the preference, the taint is cleansed.  \n\nThis approach deftly explains why preferences first formed under oppression but later reaffirmed under freedom can be counted as autonomous, while preferences actively sustained by ongoing deprivation are not.  \n\n6. Weighing the Accounts  \n\nTo see which model best explains the autonomy deficit, consider four illustrative cases:\n\nCase 1 \u2013 The Malnourished Wife: Raised in a patriarchal village, Amina honestly believes men need more food and insists on eating last.  \n\nCase 2 \u2013 The Stoic Athlete: By her own lights and after extensive reflection, Beth chooses an ascetic diet and gruelling training for the Olympics.  \n\nCase 3 \u2013 The Brainwashed Cult Member: Carl is kidnapped and subjected to intense psychological manipulation, emerging with the wholehearted desire to serve the cult leader.  \n\nCase 4 \u2013 The Fox and the Grapes: The fox, unable to reach the fruit, decides he did not really want grapes after all.  \n\nSubjectivist test:  \n\u2022 Amina, Carl, and the fox all appear to endorse their first-order desires, so the model grants them autonomy (unless additional idealisations are introduced).  \n\u2022 Beth passes as well.  \nIntuition diverges.  We think Amina, Carl, and the fox lack autonomy, while Beth seems autonomous.  Strike one against simple subjectivism.  \n\nContent-based test:  \n\u2022 Amina\u2019s self-denial is arguably morally objectionable, so she fails; Carl\u2019s desire to serve a violent cult also fails; the fox\u2019s preference seems morally neutral, so he passes, yet we still intuit a deficit.  \n\u2022 Beth\u2019s extreme asceticism may or may not be morally objectionable; content theory wavers.  \nStrike two: content-based views cannot explain the fox, and wobble on Beth.  \n\nHistorical-relational test:  \n\u2022 Amina\u2019s preference arises from lifelong oppression and continues to function within it: non-autonomous.  \n\u2022 Carl\u2019s preference originates in coercive manipulation: non-autonomous.  \n\u2022 Fox\u2019s preference arises from immediate but powerful frustration, a form of non-culpable situational constraint, so it is at least partially heteronomous.  \n\u2022 Beth\u2019s preference develops through her own critical agency within supportive social contexts: autonomous.  \n\nHistorical-relational theory tracks our judgments across the board.  \n\n7. Objections to the Historical Approach  \n\na. Too lenient?  Suppose Dora, once a victim of patriarchal socialisation, migrates, gains access to egalitarian discourse, yet still prefers traditional submissive roles.  Did history deliver a once-and-for-all verdict?  A nuanced historical view allows that post-migration Dora may come to autonomously endorse the role if she now enjoys genuine opportunities for critical reflection and if her preference plays an integrative role in her life plan.  The historical taint is not ineradicable.  \n\nb. Vagueness.  What counts as \u201cgenuine\u201d opportunity?  Here a procedural supplement helps: autonomy requires that the agent can exercise certain deliberative capacities\u2014seeking information, engaging others in dialogue, envisioning alternatives\u2014without fear of sanctions.  Measuring sufficiency will be context dependent, but that is true of most normative concepts (equality, fairness).  \n\nc. Threat of elitism.  Might the demand for critical capacities exclude agents with limited education or cognitive abilities?  Relational proceduralism responds by calibrating the required level of sophistication to the agent\u2019s stage of life and social context; the baseline is freedom from domination, not Ph.D.-level reflection.  \n\n8. Toward a Relational-Historical Proceduralism  \n\nThe best explanation of the autonomy deficit in adaptive preferences therefore combines:\n\n1. A historical component: preferences must not be products of coercive, manipulative, or oppressive formative processes.  \n\n2. A relational component: ongoing social conditions must sustain the agent\u2019s standing as an equal capable of revising her preferences.  \n\n3. A procedural component: the agent must be able to exercise deliberative capacities\u2014seeking reasons, imagining alternatives, emotionally integrating outcomes\u2014within that non-oppressive milieu.  \n\nWhen any of these three dimensions is missing, the preference is less than fully autonomous.  Adaptive preferences under oppression typically violate all three.  \n\n9. Implications for Policy and Moral Responsibility  \n\nUnderstanding the autonomy deficit historically rather than purely subjectively has practical payoffs.  Development economists and feminist activists need not brand adaptive agents as irrational dupes nor dismiss their voices wholesale.  Instead, they can aim to alter the background conditions that corrupt preference formation: improve education, widen opportunity sets, dismantle patriarchal norms.  Once conditions improve, policy makers may justifiably treat subsequent preferences as genuinely self-chosen, even if they remain traditional.  The approach also preserves scope for personal responsibility.  Beth, the stoic athlete, faces stringent demands she has autonomously chosen; she remains accountable for them.  Amina, by contrast, merits solidarity, not blame.  \n\n10. Conclusion  \n\nAdaptive preferences seem deficient in autonomy because they are produced, and kept in place, by histories of deprivation, domination, and restricted imagination.  Subjectivist, endorsement-based accounts fail to identify the defect because wholehearted identification can itself be a symptom of oppression.  Content-based, perfectionist accounts conflate moral disvalue with heteronomy, missing cases where content is innocuous yet preference is still tainted.  Historical-relational theories, especially when married to a procedural conception of free deliberation, capture the heart of the matter: a person truly governs herself only when her preferences arise from and are sustained within social conditions that respect her status as a free and equal chooser.  In settings of oppression, adaptive preferences fall short of that mark, and the rest of us incur a duty to change the structures that keep them in place.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 6, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 3622, "reasoning_tokens": 320}

Setting the Problem  \n\nMany people shape their wants to the world they confront rather than attempt to reshape the world to their wants. A twelve-year-old Afghan girl may report earnestly that what she most desires is an early marriage to a man four times her age; a long-term inmate of a maximum-security prison may come to prefer never leaving his cell; plantation slaves in the ante-bellum South occasionally expressed satisfaction with bondage, and twentieth-century Chinese women sometimes defended the beauty of bound feet. Philosophers following Jon Elster, Amartya Sen and Martha Nussbaum call such phenomena \u201cadaptive preferences\u201d: an agent adjusts her preference ranking downward to fit a restricted, often unjust, feasible set. These preferences look voluntary\u2014nobody forces the girl to mouth her desire. Yet we hesitate to call them fully autonomous. Intuitively, something has gone wrong with her self-rule; the preference seems produced by deprivation, socialisation or domination rather than by the agent\u2019s own reflective self-direction.\n\nWhat, exactly, makes an adaptive preference less than fully autonomous? Three broad explanatory strategies dominate contemporary debate.  \n\n  Subjectivist (or structural) accounts, most influentially Harry Frankfurt\u2019s hierarchical model, locate autonomy in an agent\u2019s internal pattern of higher-order endorsement of her desires.  \n  Content-based accounts, prominent in Sen\u2019s capability approach and Nussbaum\u2019s list of central human functionings, judge autonomy partly by the value or moral quality of what is preferred.  \n  Historical (sometimes called procedural-relational) accounts, elaborated by Gerald Dworkin, John Christman, Marina Oshana and others, tie autonomy to the causal history of preference formation, especially whether it involves manipulation, coercion or oppressive socialisation.\n\nEach approach captures part of the phenomenon, yet each faces characteristic difficulties. My aim is to show that, while the subjectivist and content-based stories illuminate important aspects of adaptive preference, only a suitably relational historical account can fully explain the autonomy deficit such preferences exhibit in the paradigmatic cases of oppression. Nevertheless, the historical view must be refined: it should incorporate insights about (a) how endorsement mechanisms can be colonised by oppressive contexts, and (b) why certain content\u2014concerning basic capabilities for agency\u2014matters non-accidentally to autonomy. I therefore defend a hybrid historical-relational account that remains fundamentally procedural but sensitive to both structure and content.\n\n2. Adaptive Preferences and the Idea of Autonomy  \n\nAutonomy, etymologically \u201cself-law,\u201d involves governing oneself by reasons one can own. The literature pulls this notion in different directions; yet nearly all conceptions require, at minimum:  \n\n1. Authenticity: preferences must in some sense be the agent\u2019s \u201cown\u201d; and  \n2. Self-government: the agent must be able to act on those preferences without alien control.\n\nAdaptive preferences appear to satisfy both conditions superficially. The Afghan girl sincerely identifies with her wish to marry; her family may even offer her a choice among suitors, so her action is \u201cvoluntary.\u201d The puzzle is why her authenticity rings hollow and her voluntariness smacks of resignation. Intuitively, (i) the preference seems to stem from oppressive restrictions, and (ii) it forecloses development of capacities central to any plausible account of flourishing. A good diagnosis of autonomy deficit must simultaneously make sense of these two intuitions.\n\n3. Subjectivist or Hierarchical Accounts  \n\n3.1 The Frankfurt Model  \n\nOn Frankfurt\u2019s famous hierarchy, an agent acts autonomously when she endorses her first-order desires with second-order volitions, i.e. when she wants to want what she wants. The inmate who has come to prefer his cell might\u2014let us suppose\u2014also approve of that preference upon reflection. If so, Frankfurt must classify the preference as autonomous.  \n\n3.2 Advantages  \n\na. Internalist respect: The view secures autonomy without imposing external moral standards; what counts is the agent\u2019s own evaluative standpoint.  \nb. Psychological reality: People do distinguish between urges they identify with and those they repudiate; endorsement matters.\n\n3.3 Problems with Adaptive Preferences  \n\ni. Manipulability. A sufficiently thorough process of indoctrination can engineer second-order endorsement. If a patriarchal culture conditions girls from birth to prize early marriage, they will endorse that desire at higher levels too. Frankfurt\u2019s test cannot rule out such \u201chappy slaves.\u201d  \n\nii. Static snapshot. Hierarchical endorsement is assessed synchronically\u2014how the desire sits now in the psyche. It neglects the diachronic dimension of how the desire was produced. This is fatal for the adaptive preference case, where the worry is precisely about genesis under constraint.  \n\niii. Social blindness. The account treats autonomy as an intrapsychic structure. It omits the role of systemic power in shaping which preferences are psychologically available for endorsement. Critics such as Diana Meyers and Marina Oshana argue that one cannot divorce autonomy from social conditions that enable or stunt competency in critical reflection.\n\nAttempted repairs\u2014e.g. Frankfurt\u2019s later talk of \u201cwholeheartedness,\u201d or Michael Bratman\u2019s planning agency\u2014still leave intact the charge that oppressive contexts can colonise the endorsement mechanism. Consequently, purely structural subjectivism cannot capture the autonomy deficit in adaptive preferences.\n\n4. Content-Based Accounts  \n\n4.1 The Capability/Functioning Idea  \n\nSen and Nussbaum propose that certain capabilities (bodily integrity, practical reason, affiliation, etc.) are prerequisites for human dignity. A preference that endorses the truncation of these capabilities\u2014e.g. to have bound feet, to remain uneducated, to marry at twelve\u2014is itself evidence of impaired autonomy, because autonomy partially consists in valuing and exercising those very functions.  \n\n4.2 Strengths  \n\ni. Explains moral unease. We recoil from adaptive preferences in part because they endorse objectively bad lives. Content-based accounts make this explicit.  \n\nii. Connects autonomy to flourishing. Autonomy, on this view, is not a purely formal capacity but a substantive achievement within a life that realises human powers.\n\n4.3 Criticisms  \n\ni. Perfectionism. By baking in a list of valuable functions, content accounts court the charge of paternalism: they override self-regarding choices that deviate from a predetermined ideal. The capability defender might bite this bullet, but it weakens the aspiration to respect agents\u2019 own evaluative authority.  \n\nii. Sincerity puzzle. Suppose an ascetic voluntarily renounces bodily integrity by choosing extreme fasting. Content views must declare the preference heteronomous despite the absence of oppression. They struggle to distinguish between adaptive distortion and freely embraced non-mainstream values.\n\niii. Insufficient attention to process. Even if a preference is substantively flawed, we still need to explain how it became flawed: through mistake, manipulation, mental illness, or oppression? Content views flatfootedly label both the slave\u2019s love of bondage and the ascetic\u2019s vows as equally autonomy-deficient, which seems an over-generalization.\n\nThus, although content matters morally, simply pointing to disvaluable content does not pin down the specific autonomy loss characteristic of adaptive preferences under oppression.\n\n5. Historical Accounts  \n\n5.1 Basic Idea  \n\nHistorical or procedural-relational theorists maintain that autonomy hinges on the genealogy of preferences. What matters is whether their formation involved coercion, deception, indoctrination, or social environments that agents could not reasonably resist. Christman proposes a negative condition: a preference is non-autonomous if it results from processes the agent would reject under conditions of adequate information and procedural control.  \n\n5.2 Why History Fits Adaptive Preferences  \n\na. Diachronic perspective. Adaptive preferences are paradigmatically shaped by ongoing exposure to limited options and sanctions against deviance. Without that backstory, the psychological structure today cannot be assessed.  \n\nb. Relational power. Oppression works by constraining not only what one can do but also what one can desire. Historical accounts directly integrate the social power asymmetries that produce adaptive desires.  \n\nc. Counterfactual sensitivity. The inmate\u2019s love of confinement seems autonomy-defective because, had he been offered genuine alternatives under non-coercive conditions, he would not have developed that love. Historical tests capture this \u201ccould have been otherwise\u201d insight.\n\n5.3 Objections  \n\ni. Epistemic challenge. How can we reliably trace the causal history of a given preference? Are some histories too complex or opaque? Reply: autonomy is a normative ideal, not an everyday diagnostic tool; we can rely on socially salient facts about coercive institutions (e.g., child marriage) rather than reconstructing every psychological detail.  \n\nii. Endorsement loops. What if the agent now affirms the very history that shaped her desire? Christman responds that autonomy requires not actual repudiation but the absence of histories that she could not, under reflection, reasonably accept. If the only reason she accepts them is because the same oppressive socialisation has limited her critical faculties, the autonomy deficit persists.  \n\niii. Role of content. Historical accounts are sometimes accused of moral neutrality: could they not deem a preference for benevolent slavery autonomous if it formed free of manipulation? In realistic scenarios, however, the very fostering of such a servile preference involves domination. Moreover, I will shortly argue that a thin set of content constraints\u2014basic agency capabilities\u2014is not an alien import but implicit in the idea of an unoppressive developmental history.\n\n6. Applications to Paradigmatic Cases  \n\nConsider again early marriage. Empirical studies show that girls in communities where child marriage is normative face severe informational deficits (lack of schooling), legal coercion (guardians exercise marital authority), and threats of ostracism. Historical criteria flag these pressures as autonomy-undermining processes. A Frankfurtian test would mis-fire once the girl endorses the desire; a pure content test labels the preference bad but cannot say why a mature adult\u2019s vow of celibacy differs. Historical-relational analysis explains both the wrong content and the wrongful process.\n\nOr take the inmate who loves his cell. If he had been free to cultivate life projects, his preferences would likely diverge. The adaptation results from institutional deprivation\u2014solitary confinement, micro-routine reinforcement, loss of social contact\u2014precisely the sort of environment that historical theorists mark as autonomy-corrupting. Again, endorsement is fully colonised, content is impoverished, and history makes sense of both.\n\n7. Refining the Historical View: Toward a Hybrid  \n\nWhile historical accounts outperform their rivals, they must answer two residual concerns.\n\n7.1 Internal Structure Matters  \n\nOppressive histories operate partly by warping agents\u2019 capacities for higher-order reflection. If a history leaves those capacities intact and agents still endorse a desire, perhaps autonomy is preserved. Therefore, structural endorsement remains a necessary but not sufficient condition. A defensible historical view should require that, at the time of reflection, agents possess a repertoire of critical skills and are not persistently silenced. This incorporates Frankfurtian insights without surrendering to them.\n\n7.2 Minimal Content Constraints  \n\nSecond, some human powers are integral to the very capacity for autonomous preference-formation: emotional development, practical reasoning, bodily integrity, linguistic competence. These are not controversial perfectionist add-ons; they underpin the agent\u2019s ability to evaluate her own history. If an upbringing prevents acquisition of these basic capabilities, the resulting preferences cannot be self-governing because the tools of self-governance are missing. Hence a modest content condition\u2014call it agency-enabling content\u2014is implicit in the historical story itself.\n\nThus, the best explanation is a historical-relational account supplemented (i) by a structural requirement of current critical competency and (ii) by a thin, agency-enabling content threshold.\n\n8. Reply to Possible Objections  \n\nObjection A: \u201cSome people exposed to the same oppressive conditions reject the adaptive preference. Doesn\u2019t that show the preference is autonomous when held?\u201d  \nReply: Variance in resistance does not prove autonomy in those who acquiesce; it merely indicates that strong wills can sometimes overcome oppressive formative conditions. Consent under duress becomes valid if and only if others in similar circumstances refuse? Surely not. Autonomy deficits are probabilistic, not exceptionless.\n\nObjection B: \u201cYour account risks infinite regress: to evaluate the history we must evaluate the earlier preferences that shaped that history, and so on.\u201d  \nReply: The regress halts at socially salient kinds of interference\u2014domination, coercion, severe deprivation\u2014whose autonomy-vitiating status does not itself depend on earlier desires. These are objective features of social relations, not endlessly nested preferences.\n\nObjection C: \u201cWhy privilege oppression rather than any causal influence? Aren\u2019t all preferences shaped by society?\u201d  \nReply: True, preferences are causally influenced, but not all influence is autonomy-defeating. Only those influences that systematically disable critical reflection, foreclose alternatives, and operate through power asymmetries violate the normative requirement of self-legislation. Historical-relational accounts mark this distinction precisely.\n\n9. Policy and Ethical Implications  \n\nDiagnosing adaptive preferences as non-autonomous has practical stakes. For example, development agencies debate whether to respect women\u2019s self-reported contentment with seclusion. A hierarchical test would counsel deference; a content-based view might impose emancipation paternalistically; the historical-relational framework recommends a middle path: create genuine alternatives (education, legal rights, economic opportunities) and conditions for critical reflection, then observe whether preferences persist. This approach honours agency by working to restore autonomy rather than overriding expressed wishes tout court.\n\n10. Conclusion  \n\nAdaptive preferences reveal autonomy\u2019s social fragility: people can come to want what harms them when unjust structures circumscribe their horizons. Examining why such preferences are less than fully autonomous puts pressure on theories of autonomy. Purely subjectivist accounts falter because they ignore the formative power of oppressive contexts; pure content accounts overreach by moralising without explaining the special wrong of domination. Historical-relational theories succeed because they tether autonomy to the provenance of desires, weaving in considerations of power and feasibility. Yet they must be enriched by (a) a structural requirement of present-time critical competence and (b) recognition that certain basic capabilities are conditions of the very possibility of autonomous history assessment.\n\nAccordingly, adaptive preferences are autonomy-deficient chiefly because of how they were produced\u2014through processes of oppression that deny agents the opportunity and the capacities to exercise critical self-direction. By restoring those opportunities and capacities, we respect persons not by dictating what they should value, but by empowering them to find out for themselves.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 7, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 3278, "reasoning_tokens": 192}
{"question_id": "Enoch-FalseConsciousnessLiberals-2020", "question": "What makes adaptive preferences\u2014preferences shaped in response to constraints on one's feasible options\u2014less than fully autonomous? Consider whether subjectivist accounts (such as Frankfurt's hierarchical model of desire endorsement), content-based accounts (which evaluate the moral quality of what is preferred), or historical accounts (which examine how the preference was formed) best explain the autonomy deficit that adaptive preferences seem to exhibit, particularly in cases of oppression.", "answer": "What makes adaptive preferences\u2014preferences that adjust to severely limited possibilities\u2014fail to display the kind of self\u2010government we call autonomy? Ever since Jon Elster\u2019s classic discussion of \u201csour grapes,\u201d philosophers have been troubled by the fact that people may come positively to desire what previously looked unappealing, or even to endorse what disadvantages or harms them, simply because all more attractive alternatives have been placed out of reach. The phenomenon is accentuated in settings of oppression: a woman in a deeply patriarchal community may come to insist that she has no wish to be educated; a sweat-shop worker may \u201cprefer\u201d the fourteen-hour shift because \u201cthat\u2019s what life is.\u201d These are not coerced decisions in the straightforward sense that a gun is held to the agent\u2019s head at the moment of choice. Rather, the entire horizon of feasible options has been narrowed, often across generations, and people\u2019s desires slowly conform to that horizon.\n\nThe intuitive judgment many of us share is that such preferences are, in some respect, less than fully autonomous. Yet articulating the basis of this autonomy deficit proves surprisingly difficult. Three prominent families of accounts compete for philosophical allegiance.\n\n1. Subjectivist (or structural) accounts focus on the agent\u2019s current psychological economy\u2014most prominently, Harry Frankfurt\u2019s hierarchical model of desires, on which what matters is whether one \u201cwholeheartedly\u201d endorses a first-order preference from the standpoint of higher-order volitions.\n\n2. Content\u2010based (or substantive) accounts hold that certain sorts of preferences\u2014for example, preferences for pain, for servility, or for gendered subservience\u2014are autonomy-diminishing simply in virtue of what they are about; their content violates some objective standard of human flourishing or dignity.\n\n3. Historical accounts emphasize the process by which the preference was formed. Even if a preference is wholeheartedly endorsed now, and even if its content is not obviously objectionable, it may still lack autonomy if it originated through manipulation, coercive socialisation, internalised oppression, or a systematically truncated set of opportunities.\n\nThe question is which of these explanatory models best captures the distinctive worry about adaptive preferences in oppressive circumstances. In what follows I examine each view in turn, assess its ability to diagnose the deficit, and argue that while all three illuminate part of the phenomenon, a historically inflected analysis\u2014supplemented by procedural conditions on self-assessment\u2014comes closest to vindicating our considered intuitions.\n\nI. The Subjectivist (Hierarchical) Account\n\nFrankfurt\u2019s theory has the initial advantage of respecting the agent\u2019s perspective. What matters, he says, is whether the agent endorses her first-order desires at a higher level. A preference is autonomous if and only if it is one the agent \u201cwants to want,\u201d about which she is wholeheartedly committed. The hierarchical model therefore seems tailor-made to explain why some adjusted preferences remain autonomous: people often make peace with genuine constraints. A paraplegic who learns to value wheelchair basketball over mountaineering is not thereby alienated from herself; she may second-order endorse her new sports preferences wholeheartedly.\n\nBut the model fares poorly in paradigmatic cases of oppressive adaptation. Consider the village girl who has been told since birth that educating women undermines family honour. She not only claims to lack interest in schooling, she sincerely repudiates such aspirations when she introspects. On Frankfurt\u2019s test, her desire appears autonomous, since it is endorsed at the second order. Yet many of us balk: the stability of her endorsement results from a sustained deprivation of information, options, and counter-narratives. The problem seems not to be located within her current motivational hierarchy alone. What is missing is any check on whether higher-order endorsement itself has been distorted by social power.\n\nAttempts to patch up the hierarchical account by adding a \u201cwholeheartedness\u201d or \u201cauthenticity\u201d condition do not resolve the difficulty. The villager may indeed be perfectly wholehearted; the entire structure of her culture confirms that submissiveness is honourable. Frankfurt\u2019s approach offers no criterion to distinguish wholeheartedness born of independent reflection from wholeheartedness produced by an oppressive upbringing. It risks an excessively internalist picture in which any desire that the agent comfortably owns here and now passes muster, no matter how malign the forces that shaped her comfort level.\n\nSome subjectivists respond by embedding their model in a richer procedural framework. They propose, for instance, that autonomy requires exposure to critical reflection, imaginative rehearsal of alternatives, or dialogical challenge. If the villager had never seriously considered an alternative life, her second-order endorsement is \u201cprocedurally defective.\u201d This move edges the subjectivist view toward a historically sensitive analysis, since the required critical capacities and information depend on the agent\u2019s past. Still, once one appeals to such broader social conditions, the distinctive explanatory depth of the pure hierarchical model is lost; the heavy work is done by historical variables.\n\nII. The Content-Based Account\n\nA quite different strategy, associated with Martha Nussbaum, Amartya Sen, and capability theorists, holds that certain life activities and goods are objectively central to human flourishing. If a preference is forgoing, say, bodily health, practical reasoning, or affiliation, then the preference itself is suspect. The woman who \u201cprefers\u201d female genital cutting or illiteracy is less than fully autonomous because her preference endorses a genuine harm. Were she functioning properly, she would recognise this; her apparent endorsement is an indicator of adaptive degradation.\n\nContent\u2010based approaches capture an important moral insight. Oppression can warp people\u2019s desires so that they welcome their own subordination; identifying and criticising that content is sometimes indispensable. Moreover, these accounts explain why our negative judgment is strongest when the adapted preference concerns urgent capabilities (e.g., bodily integrity) rather than more trivial options (preferring coffee to tea because the shop is out of tea seems innocuous).\n\nYet content-based theories face two formidable objections.\n\n1. Paternalism. Declaring that certain preferences are not truly the agent\u2019s because they deviate from an external list can slide into paternalistic disrespect. Many feminists warn that outsiders may too quickly brand some minority practices \u201cautonomy-reducing,\u201d imposing their own cultural standards.\n\n2. Conflation of Autonomy with Well-Being. Autonomy concerns self\u2010government, not whether the self happens to govern badly. A person can autonomously choose an objectively poor life, just as she can autonomously gamble away her fortune. Substance theorists risk collapsing the distinction between living well and living self-directedly.\n\nTo illustrate, imagine an ascetic monk who wholeheartedly, and after critical reflection, prefers a life of material deprivation. On a strict capability metric, his preference threatens basic human functioning. Yet it would be odd to deem him non-autonomous. He has not adjusted under oppressive constraint but out of religious commitment. The content of his preference alone cannot settle the autonomy question.\n\nThis gap is even clearer with \u201ctrivial\u201d adaptive preferences. Suppose a commuter in a strike-bound city comes to enjoy bicycling; his desire has adapted to the unavailability of trains. The content (liking cycling) is benign, but the causal story is still adaptive. We normally see no autonomy deficit here. Therefore content-based accounts over-generate judgments of non-autonomy when they treat any preference involving reduced capabilities as suspect, and under-generate when the harmed capability is not on the list.\n\nIII. The Historical Account\n\nHistorical theories locate autonomy in the diachronic trajectory of preference formation. What matters is whether the agent had adequate opportunities, information, critical scrutiny, and social space to accept or reject a preference as it emerged. The dominant line, pioneered by Diana Meyers, Natalie Stoljar, Marina Oshana, and Paul Benson, insists that autonomy requires \u201cnew explanatory spaces\u201d connecting agency to social power.\n\nAdaptive preferences under oppression are exactly those shaped by histories of multifaceted constraint: material deprivation, cultural devaluation, false consciousness, habituation, or threats of sanction. These mechanisms neither force moment-to-moment behaviour nor completely silence reflection; rather, they channel the developmental environment so that certain options never present themselves as live possibilities, or present themselves only as shameful, dangerous, or unnatural. The resulting preference may be wholeheartedly embraced, and its content might not be obviously disvaluable (imagine preferring house-work to wage labour), but nonetheless it originates in a process systematically engineered to serve another group\u2019s interests.\n\nHistorical accounts can accommodate three features that confound rival theories.\n\n1. The Autonomy/Well-Being Distinction. Because they focus on genesis rather than content, historical models can say that the commuter\u2019s newfound love of cycling is autonomous: it arose from a temporary, non-oppressive shortage of trains, a constraint not intended to keep him subservient. By contrast, the oppressed villager\u2019s disdain for education emerged from a patriarchal structure aimed at entrenching gender power. Autonomy deficits track oppressive causal pathways, not mere disadvantage.\n\n2. Variability Among Adaptive Preferences. Not every adaptation is suspect. If a paraplegic cultivates a taste for wheelchair basketball through supportive rehabilitation, the historical process is empowering, not oppressive. Historical accounts can differentiate benign from malignant adaptation by scrutinising the social forces at work.\n\n3. Responsiveness to Counterfactuals. Suppose the villager had been presented with sustained, non\u2010coercive access to schooling role models. Would she likely revise her preference? If yes, this indicates that the actual preference is fragile with respect to unjust background conditions. Historical models incorporate this counterfactual sensitivity naturally: autonomy requires that the agent\u2019s preference be robust across changes that remove oppressive obstacles.\n\nNevertheless, historical theories invite worries of their own.\n\nA. The Etiological Challenge. Every preference has determinants\u2014family influence, random encounters, biological impulses. If mere causal dependency undermines autonomy, none of our preferences would be autonomous. Historical theorists must distinguish normal socialisation from autonomy-defeating manipulation.\n\nB. The Access Problem. To judge whether a preference arose through oppression, we need detailed empirical knowledge about the agent\u2019s biographical context. Philosophers risk speculative armchair diagnoses.\n\nC. The Causal/Normative Gap. Even if a preference was produced by injustice, why does that fact reduce present authority? After all, adults can reflect and endorse their formative influences. Historical accounts need a normative bridge explaining why certain causal histories remain tainting despite later endorsement.\n\nSeveral theorists have proposed solutions. Oshana argues that autonomy is essentially relational: it obtains only when social conditions ensure \u201cself-authorised\u201d choice. Oppressive structures undermine that standing forever, unless dismantled and the agent gains an opportunity to reconsider. Benson appeals to \u201cnormative competence\u201d: oppression can impair the development of interpretive skills necessary for critical identification with one\u2019s commitments. These proposals aim to answer the Etiological Challenge by specifying which kinds of causal histories deprive agents of the dispositions, competencies, or social authority that autonomy presupposes.\n\nImportantly, historical accounts can integrate procedural tests familiar from the subjectivist framework: an individual may recover autonomy over a once-adaptive preference by re-examining it under non-oppressive circumstances, exercising critical faculties unobstructed by fear or misinformation. The complaint is not that the preference\u2019s origin irreversibly pollutes it, but that until adequate opportunities for re-evaluation arise, the preference lacks standing.\n\nIV. Why Oppression Matters: A Functional Diagnosis\n\nTo see why adaptive preferences under oppression are autonomy-impaired, consider the functional role autonomy plays in normative theory. Autonomy allocates responsibility and respect: autonomous agents are trustworthy to set their own ends. The social point of blaming oppression is that it interferes with this self-legislation. Oppressive adaptation is autonomy-defeating insofar as it systematically shuts down the very capacities\u2014imaginative, deliberative, affective\u2014that make genuine self-direction possible.\n\nSubjectivist endorsement cannot, on its own, guarantee that these capacities have not been truncated, because endorsement itself may be conditioned by truncated capacities. Content-based criteria lack the flexibility to track whether the capacities are functioning, since a preference for a capability loss can be fully autonomous in certain contexts (monastic vows). Historical scrutiny, by contrast, directly evaluates whether the agent had a fair developmental field on which to exercise and cultivate her capacities for critical reflection.\n\nWe can formulate a two-stage historical diagnosis:\n\nStage 1. Deprivation of Counterfactual Choice. The agent\u2019s social world lacked minimally sufficient exposure to alternative forms of life, or punished exploration of those alternatives. This undermines the initial formation of evaluative attitudes.\n\nStage 2. Persistence Without Re-Evaluation. The agent continues to live under circumstances that block serious reconsideration. So long as this blockage persists, the preference remains autonomy-deficient, regardless of present endorsement.\n\nThese stages answer the Causal/Normative Gap objection: it is not causal origin per se that matters, but the ongoing absence of fair conditions of self-scrutiny. Once those conditions are met\u2014say, after migration to a different culture or through feminist consciousness-raising\u2014the agent can autonomously reaffirm, modify, or abandon the preference. Historical taint is not indelible; rather, autonomy is a standing that can be regained when the oppressive context is lifted.\n\nV. Objections and Replies\n\nObjection 1: Some adaptive preferences emerge under hard but non-oppressive constraints\u2014e.g., miners who grow to like underground work because above-ground jobs disappeared. Historical accounts would have to label these preferences non-autonomous, which seems excessive.\n\nReply: The historical model can differentiate between \u201chardship adaptation\u201d and \u201coppressive adaptation.\u201d Oppression involves structural asymmetries of power where one group benefits from another\u2019s curtailed options. Geological shifts that close factories impose hardship but do not express an unjust hierarchy. Thus the miners\u2019 adapted preference can be fully autonomous.\n\nObjection 2: Historical accounts render autonomy hostage to sociological facts agents themselves may not know. That seems unfair; autonomy should be ascribed based on what the person can reasonably access.\n\nReply: Autonomy concerns the normative legitimacy of self-governance, which partly depends on whether the social environment has sabotaged deliberative competencies. It is a relational status, not an introspective feeling. Therefore some facts the agent cannot know may be relevant\u2014just as consent in medical ethics can be invalid if information is hidden, even if the patient feels fully informed.\n\nObjection 3: Sometimes oppressed agents actively resist internalisation and still prefer certain traditional roles. If historical accounts condemn any preference traceable to oppressive structures, they disrespect these women\u2019s agency.\n\nReply: The view proposed here targets preferences produced by deprivation of critical opportunity, not preferences that persist after authentic resistance. When a preference survives robust, uncoerced examination, its oppressive origin no longer undermines autonomy. The key is whether the agent had\u2014and took\u2014credible chances to scrutinise and explore alternatives.\n\nVI. A Tentative Synthesis\n\nWhile I have argued that historical explanations best capture the autonomy deficit, the discussion reveals useful insights from each framework.\n\nFrom subjectivists we learn that autonomous preference ultimately requires some form of self-endorsement; external correction alone is insufficient. Historical accounts should include a procedural threshold: at some point the agent must, reflectively and with competence, ratify or revise her wants.\n\nFrom content theorists we learn that certain substantive human interests (bodily integrity, practical reason) are especially vulnerable to adaptive deformation and merit vigilance. Historical models can use such interests as diagnostic prompts: when a preference undermines them, we have prima facie reason to suspect defective formation.\n\nThus a hybrid account emerges.\n\n1. Autonomy\u2010relevant interests: Identify domains where impairment would gravely handicap future self-rule.\n\n2. Historical scrutiny: Ask whether, in forming a preference within those domains, the agent had adequate informational, imaginative, and social resources.\n\n3. Reflective endorsement: Require that, given access to such resources, the agent maintain or reaffirm the preference.\n\nOnly when all three conditions are met should we deem the preference fully autonomous.\n\nVII. Conclusion\n\nAdaptive preferences puzzle philosophers because they straddle the boundary between rational coping and distorted acquiescence. A person logically adjusts her wants to what is feasible; yet under oppression, that very logic can entrench injustice by creating the appearance of consent. Subjectivist accounts, focusing on present endorsement, overlook the formative deprivation; content-based accounts, focusing on objective goods, elide the agent\u2019s own authority. Historical accounts, properly developed, show why the absence of formative freedom undermines current self-governance, while allowing that autonomy can be reclaimed through re-evaluation under emancipatory conditions.\n\nIn the end, the autonomy deficit arises not because the adaptive preference is unendorsed, nor because it is aimed at the wrong object, but because the social process that forged it disabled the agent from exercising the full repertoire of reflective, imaginative, and self\u2010corrective capacities that autonomy presupposes. Only a historically attuned analysis can keep faith with the lived complexities of oppression while safeguarding the ideal of persons as authors of their own lives.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 8, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 3913, "reasoning_tokens": 384}

Introduction: Adaptive Preference and the Puzzle of Impaired Autonomy  \n\nA shop-girl in nineteenth-century Manchester \u201cprefers\u201d twelve-hour shifts over the prospect of idleness; a bride in contemporary rural Bangladesh \u201cprefers\u201d early marriage to prolonged schooling; a factory worker accepts the absence of safety regulations as a \u201cnecessary sacrifice.\u201d  In each case the agent\u2019s stated preference looks voluntary\u2014no one points a gun to her head\u2014yet philosophers, policy-makers, and the women themselves, once circumstances change, are uneasy.  The worry is not merely that the preference leads to bad outcomes; it is that the preference seems less than fully her own.  We confront the phenomenon that Amartya Sen, Jon Elster and others call adaptive preference: an agent alters her preference set so that what remains feasible, however impoverished, comes to feel \u201cpreferred.\u201d  The normative question is why such preferences strike us as deficient in autonomy.  \n\nThree broad diagnostic families compete for explanatory primacy:\n\n     (1) Subjectivist/hierarchical accounts, epitomised by Harry Frankfurt, locate autonomy in the agent\u2019s reflective endorsement of her first-order desires.  \n\n     (2) Content-based or perfectionist accounts judge autonomy by the substantive moral quality of what is preferred.  \n\n     (3) Historical or procedural accounts explain deficits by appeal to the oppressive or distorting processes through which the preference was formed.  \n\nI argue that while each approach illuminates part of the puzzle, historical accounts\u2014supplemented by a relational understanding of how social power infiltrates deliberation\u2014offer the most adequate explanation of the autonomy deficit typical of adaptive preferences.  They avoid the circularity of content-based views and the \u201cinternality\u201d blind spot of subjectivist models, yet give principled reasons for why and when external interference (education, option-expansion, sometimes even paternalistic constraint) can enhance rather than violate autonomy.\n\n2. The Subjectivist Promise\u2014and Its Limits  \n\nOn Frankfurt\u2019s canonical picture, an agent acts autonomously when her first-order desire (D1) to \u03c6 is wholeheartedly endorsed by a higher-order desire (D2) that she want the first-order desire to move her to action.  If the bride sincerely wants to marry at fourteen and also wants that very desire to shape her life, she is, by Frankfurtian lights, acting freely.  Subjectivist models thus appear friendly to the idea that even strongly constrained or socially shaped preferences can be autonomous, provided the agent reflectively embraces them.\n\nYet adaptive preference cases place stress on two key premises of the subjectivist view:\n\n     a) Reflective access and imagination:  Frankfurt assumes that the agent can envisage and assess alternative first-order desires.  But adaptive preferences often arise precisely because feasible alternatives have been pruned away, materially or imaginatively.  The Bangladeshi girl may \u201cwholeheartedly\u201d endorse early marriage only because the option space she can represent is radically foreshortened.  If one cannot imagine becoming a lawyer, how meaningful is one\u2019s second-order rejection of the desire to stay in school?  \n\n     b) Independence of endorsement:  Frankfurt treats reflective endorsement as insulated from the very forces that shaped the first-order desire.  Yet in oppressive contexts, the reflective faculty itself is socialised and disciplined.  Second-order endorsement is not an independent tribunal but a jury already vetted by patriarchy or class domination.  Wholeheartedness becomes cognitively closed authoritarianism.\n\nSubjectivists reply with a voluntariness condition: if the endorsement is the result of irresistible coercion or manipulation, it is not autonomous.  But recall that adaptive preferences grow in arenas where coercion is soft, pervasive, normalised.  There is no moment at which a manipulator injects the desire; rather, long-term social habituation operates.  Without a robust account of how background power systematically biases endorsement, subjectivist models risk ratifying adaptive preferences as fully autonomous when they are anything but.\n\n3. Content-Based Assessments:  The Lure of Moral Substantivism  \n\nSome philosophers (e.g., Joseph Raz\u2019s perfectionist liberalism, Martha Nussbaum\u2019s capability approach) cut the Gordian knot by stipulating that certain life-plans are objectively better: functioning in health, reasoning, affiliation, practical control over one\u2019s environment.  Preferences that reject or truncate these capabilities are ipso facto autonomy-deficient.  If the child-bride\u2019s preference forecloses her basic capabilities, it cannot be fully autonomous, no matter how reflectively endorsed.\n\nThis manoeuvre has intuitive punch and explains the frequent co-occurrence of adaptive preference and deprivation.  Still, it faces two objections:\n\n     a) Paternalism and Respect:  Declaring that a preference is nonautonomous because it contravenes an externally defined list of valuable functions risks collapsing autonomy into moral correctness.  Yet autonomy and ethical propriety are conceptually distinct; one may autonomously choose badly (think of Gauguin\u2019s desertion of family to paint) or nonautonomously \u201cchoose\u201d well (Stockholm hostages expressing gratitude to their captors).  \n\n     b) Contextual Relativity:  Content-based criteria often abstract from cultural and material context.  Suppose the Manchester worker, aware of the health hazards, still prefers factory work because she judges any alternative hunger and prostitution worse.  Labeling her preference \u201cnonautonomous\u201d on the basis of its content alone obscures the tragic rationality of choice under unjust conditions.  \n\nHence content-based accounts risk both moralism and sociological naivet\u00e9; they persuade only if one already shares the perfectionist premise.  They identify many adaptive preferences as autonomy-deficient but cannot explain, rather than stipulate, why the deficit attaches to those preferences.\n\n4. Historical-Procedural Accounts:  Tracing the Genealogy of a Preference  \n\nHistorical theories posit that autonomy depends not on what one now prefers but on how that preference came to be.  The agent must stand in the right sort of relation to the causal history of her desire.\n\na) The basic model:  A preference is autonomous if it is the product of processes that respect the agent\u2019s critical faculties\u2014processes untainted by coercion, deception, forced ignorance, or systematic indoctrination.  Robert Young, Laura Ekstrom, and more recently Natalie Stoljar and Serene Khader have defended variants.\n\nb) Advantages vis-\u00e0-vis adaptive preference:  The hallmark of adaptiveness is that a constraint not only limits what one can do but boomerangs to shape what one comes to want.  The historical view pinpoints the injury: an oppressive environment filters information, narrows imagination, punishes deviance, rewards docility, and thereby \u201cforces\u201d the agent to confect subjective endorsement.  Even wholeheartedness fails the historical test because the internal pro-attitude is itself the sediment of external domination.\n\nc) Empirical plausibility:  We can recount causal narratives\u2014patriarchal pedagogies, economic vulnerability, testimonial silencing\u2014that explain why certain populations disproportionately endorse stereotypically oppressive options.  These stories, when fleshed out, vindicate the intuition that something went awry in the genesis of the preference.\n\nd) Avoiding moralism:  A historical account can respect idiosyncrasy.  Suppose a woman long exposed to diverse options freely chooses homemaking because she happens to love childcare.  Her preference\u2019s content resembles that of women in oppressive contexts, yet the genesis differs; the historical model yields the right verdict of autonomy.\n\n5. Two Objections to the Historical Account and Replies  \n\nObjection 1: Regress\u2014All preferences are socially formed; where do we draw the line between permissible and autonomy-undermining socialisation?\n\nReply: The \u201cmere social influence\u201d objection rightly notes that humans are encultured animals, but oppression is not a difference in degree alone; it involves systematic, asymmetrical power that forecloses critical assessment.  The historical view can specify disqualifying conditions: deception, coerced ignorance, adaptive dampening of aspiration, and non-accidental correlation with a subordinated social identity.  These markers separate generic upbringing from autonomy-subverting formation.\n\nObjection 2: Time-slice rescue\u2014What if the agent, aware of her oppressive history, now reaffirms the preference?  Wouldn\u2019t that undo earlier contamination?\n\nReply:  It depends.  If the reaffirmation is undertaken in conditions that remedy epistemic deprivation\u2014exposure to alternatives, equal respect, space to experiment\u2014then yes, the preference may mature into an autonomous one.  Historical accounts need not eternally taint a desire; they show that current autonomy hinges on whether the agent has genuinely had a chance to scrutinise and, if she wishes, revise the preference.  Where structural conditions still impede that scrutiny, reaffirmation is insufficient.\n\n6. Relational Autonomy as Complement  \n\nCritics note that individual-level historical accounts still picture the agent as a discrete subject who, given the right past, can deliberate in a vacuum.  Feminist philosophers (Mackenzie, Oshana, Stoljar) argue that we also need a relational criterion: autonomy requires ongoing social recognition and non-domination.  Adaptive preferences are often relationally heteronomous\u2014they are sustained by social scripts whose non-compliance incurs sanctions.\n\nCombining historical with relational insights yields a more nuanced diagnosis.  The preference to be a docile daughter-in-law is nonautonomous not only because it was instilled by patriarchal upbringing (history) but also because current power relations punish dissent (relations).  Even if the woman could in principle move to the city and change her mind, the costs are not abstract; they are socially inflicted.  Thus historical accounts, broadened into relational historical accounts, best track both diachronic and synchronic dimensions of autonomy.\n\n7. Clarifying the Autonomy Deficit: Three Dimensions  \n\nThe superiority of the historical-relational framework can be seen by parsing autonomy into its constitutive conditions.\n\n     a) Authenticity (are these truly my desires?) \u2013 subjectivist accounts emphasise this dimension but fail to explain false consciousness.  Historical-relational accounts tell us when authenticity is corrupted by oppressive internalisation.\n\n     b) Self-governance (can I act on my desires?) \u2013 content-based accounts sometimes conflate self-governance with attaining objectively valuable ends.  Historical-relational models focus instead on the agent\u2019s practical authority, highlighting how social penalties restrict governability.\n\n     c) Self-authorization (do I regard myself as the legitimate source of reasons?) \u2013 this is jeopardised when an entire social system denies certain groups epistemic authority, leading them to internalise deference.  Adaptive preference is one symptom.  Historical-relational analysis makes explicit this internalised de-legitimation.\n\n8. Policy Implications: From Diagnosis to Remedy  \n\nWhy does the correct explanation matter?  If subjectivist accounts were right, autonomy would counsel non-interference whenever a second-order endorsement can be elicited.  Yet this would trap people in adaptive preference cycles, because expansion of material and imaginative options often requires external intervention\u2014education subsidies, affirmative action, consciousness-raising.\n\nContent-based perfectionism, by contrast, might justify heavy-handed paternalism: ban early marriage, outlaw factory work.  Such measures, while improving welfare, can disrespect agency or backfire politically.\n\nHistorical-relational analysis supports a middle path:  rectify the background conditions that warp preference formation\u2014inequitable property regimes, discriminatory laws, biased media, lack of safe exit options.  The goal is not to substitute new preferences for old but to create autonomy-conducive environments in which agents can test, affirm, or reject inherited desires.  This generates practical guidance: prioritize option-expansion, deliberative fora, and resistance to penalties for deviance, rather than direct substitution of \u201ccorrect\u201d preferences.\n\n9. Hard Cases and Residual Ambiguities  \n\nConsider a religious novice who freely enters a cloister, vows obedience, and years later reports contentment.  Some critics think this, too, is an adaptive preference.  Does the historical-relational view declare it nonautonomous?  We must ask: was the novice systematically shielded from secular alternatives, threatened with damnation narratives, denied exit?  If so, autonomy is compromised; if not, the choice may be self-authored.  The historical account is capable of such case-by-case discrimination, unlike crude content-based verdicts that dismiss monastic life altogether or subjectivist deference that ignores early indoctrination.\n\nAnother difficulty concerns elites in wealthy societies who adapt downward in smaller ways\u2014preferring cheaper holidays after economic downturns, for example.  Are their preferences nonautonomous?  The answer is typically no, because the historical-relational markers of oppression are absent; constraints in these cases are temporary, transparent, and leave critical capacities intact.\n\n10. Conclusion  \n\nAdaptive preferences unsettle the tidy liberal assumption that what people prefer is what is good for them and, more importantly, authentically their own.  The philosophical challenge is to articulate why such preferences are frequently autonomy-deficient without lapsing into moralistic perfectionism or discrediting all socially formed desires.  \n\nSubjectivist models fail because they overlook the fact that reflective endorsement itself can be colonised by oppressive structures; content-based models fail because they collapse autonomy into substantive ideals.  Historical accounts, especially when augmented by a relational understanding of ongoing power dynamics, capture what is distinctive about adaptive preferences: they are the interiorised residue of external domination that pre-emptively deforms the processes of imagination, deliberation, and self-authorization upon which autonomy depends.\n\nRecognising this genealogy allows us both to respect agency and to justify emancipatory interventions aimed at expanding real options and fostering the epistemic conditions under which agents can truly decide for themselves what to want.  The autonomy deficit, then, lies not (or not only) in the content of the adapted preference, nor in the absence of a fleeting endorsement, but in the oppressive history by which the preference came to seem the only live option\u2014and in the social present that continues to entrench that illusion.  Rectifying that history and transforming those relations is the path, not to choosing for others, but to enabling them, at last, to choose for themselves.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 9, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 3192, "reasoning_tokens": 192}
{"question_id": "Enoch-FalseConsciousnessLiberals-2020", "question": "What makes adaptive preferences\u2014preferences shaped in response to constraints on one's feasible options\u2014less than fully autonomous? Consider whether subjectivist accounts (such as Frankfurt's hierarchical model of desire endorsement), content-based accounts (which evaluate the moral quality of what is preferred), or historical accounts (which examine how the preference was formed) best explain the autonomy deficit that adaptive preferences seem to exhibit, particularly in cases of oppression.", "answer": "Adaptive preferences are the preferences that agents come to hold in response to limits\u2014social, economic, political or physical\u2014on what they can in fact do. A woman who ceases to want higher education because her society forbids women to attend university, a Dalit who persuades himself that he really does prefer the \u201chumble\u201d life allotted to his caste, or a prisoner who claims to desire nothing so much as the routine of the cell block have all, in the canonical sense made familiar by Amartya Sen, Jon Elster and Martha Nussbaum, adapted to a deprived feasible set. There is a widespread intuition that such preferences are \u201cless than fully autonomous.\u201d The question is how best to explain this autonomy deficit. Three families of theories are standardly invoked:\n\n1. Subjectivist or internalist accounts, exemplified by Harry Frankfurt\u2019s hierarchical model of endorsement, which ground autonomy in an agent\u2019s reflectively endorsed higher-order desires.\n\n2. Content-based accounts, which hold that autonomy can be defeated by the moral or prudential badness of what the agent prefers.\n\n3. Historical or procedural accounts, which locate deficits in the causal story of how the preference was produced, emphasizing oppression, deception, or coercive socialization.\n\nWhich analysis does most justice to the phenomenon of adaptive preferences, especially when these preferences arise under conditions of structural oppression? I shall argue that while each approach captures an important piece of the puzzle, a nuanced historical account provides the most satisfying explanation, but only when enriched by insights borrowed from subjectivist reflection and by a modest, non-perfectionist concern for objectionable content. In other words, we need a historical-procedural view that remains sensitive to what the agent can in principle reflectively endorse under conditions free of domination, and to the objective harms enshrined in certain contents. I develop this claim in four steps. First, I analyse why subjectivist endorsement is insufficient. Second, I explain why sheer appeal to value-laden content is at once too strong and too weak. Third, I defend an historically inflected, social-relational picture of adaptive preference formation. Finally, I show how the three strands can be woven together into an integrated position that both diagnoses autonomy failures and guides emancipatory political practice.\n\n1. The limits of subjectivist endorsement\n\nFrankfurt famously distinguishes first-order desires (to smoke, to sleep, to marry young) from second-order desires or volitions (to want or not want certain first-order desires to move one to action). Autonomy, on this view, resides in a harmony of levels: I am autonomous just insofar as the desire that motivates me is the one I approve of upon reflection. To explain why an adaptive preference is non-autonomous, the subjectivist can say that the oppressed woman does not endorse her desire to forego education; she has merely resigned herself. Yet matters are not so simple. Suppose she does endorse it. After years of persuading herself that women find real fulfilment in domestic work, she forms a wholehearted second-order desire to prefer household labour to bookish study. Frankfurt would then have to count the preference autonomous. However, it still strikes many of us\u2014and arguably strikes the agent herself when imaginatively freed from oppression\u2014as in some sense unfree. \n\nProponents of the hierarchical model respond by refining the endorsement condition. They appeal to conditions of \u201cinformed and ideally situated reflection.\u201d But this threatens to smuggle in precisely the historical and social constraints the account meant to sidestep, now relabelled as necessary conditions for genuine endorsement. Moreover, the model struggles with adaptive desires that have infiltrated the agent\u2019s higher-order system from the start. If a brutally patriarchal culture inculcates women with the meta-preference \u201cI should want what my father or husband wants me to want,\u201d then an internally coherent hierarchy of desires can coexist with radical heteronomy. Frankfurt himself took heteronomy to involve the will\u2019s being \u201coverborne by forces external to the person.\u201d Yet when external social forces shape my deepest volitional structure, they do not overbear an already-formed will; they constitute it. Hierarchical endorsement, absent further constraints, therefore cannot always explain the felt deficit in autonomy.\n\n2. The temptations and perils of a content test\n\nA second family of theories diagnoses non-autonomy by appealing to the moral disvalue of the preferences themselves. The thought is that wanting a life of servitude, sexual subordination or caste oppression is so substantively defective that the desire cannot be fully one\u2019s own. Some theorists embrace this forthrightly perfectionist line: there are certain forms of life that no rational and self-respecting person could ever freely choose; if someone appears to choose them, we infer a failure of autonomy. Advocates often draw inspiration from Kant\u2019s idea that autonomy involves legislating universal moral law for oneself; a willing that contradicts the conditions of universal respect is self-undermining. \n\nContent-based diagnoses have bite, particularly in extreme cases. When a victim of childhood abuse claims, apparently sincerely, to want further abuse, many of us immediately suspect that something has gone awry in the formation of that want. But the content test swoops too low and too high. Too low, because it risks labeling non-autonomous any preference whose content strikes some observer as morally unworthy; this is paternalistic and culturally imperialistic, erasing legitimate diversity. Too high, because it cannot distinguish between adaptive preferences and innocent, freely chosen preferences that happen to have objectionable content. A sadist who wholeheartedly wants to torture cats for fun does not display an adaptive preference\u2014he has not accommodated himself to constrained options\u2014but most content theorists will deem his desire non-autonomous notwithstanding. The test thereby loses the specific explanatory connection to oppression and constraint that makes the adaptive preference problem philosophically distinctive.\n\nMoreover, content-based accounts appear helpless when the content is not in itself objectionable but is embraced for wrong reasons. Consider a factory worker in a capitalist economy who comes to prefer consuming cheap fashion rather than fighting for shorter hours. The preference per se\u2014liking clothes\u2014is morally innocent, yet social forces may have shaped it in ways that undermine agency. Content tests are blunt instruments for such subtleties. \n\n3. Toward a historical-procedural account\n\nHistorical views, by contrast, go directly to the genesis of the preference. Joseph Raz, Gerald Dworkin, and, more recently, relational theorists such as Marina Oshana and Andrea Westlund argue that autonomy requires a certain kind of history\u2014one free of coercion, manipulation, indoctrination or systematic deprivation of information. The agent must, in Susan Wolf\u2019s phrase, \u201cbe able adequately to appreciate the factual and moral world.\u201d When a woman internalises patriarchal norms under threat of ostracism or violence, the causal process is shot through with oppressive power relations; her resulting preferences, though sincerely embraced, lack the pedigree autonomy demands. \n\nHistorical accounts elegantly capture why a preference that is reflectively endorsed and not objectionable in content can nevertheless smack of heteronomy: the agent\u2019s endorsement itself is a product of domination. They also explain why mere dispositional or behavioural evidence of endorsement is insufficient; what matters is that the endorsement could withstand critical scrutiny were the agent granted the resources that oppression denies her. Further, historical theories avoid content paternalism because they focus on process rather than substance; they leave open that very strange or even morally bad preferences might be autonomous if formed in the right way, as with the free sadist.\n\nStill, a purely procedural history faces difficulties. First, it seems to imply that once the oppressive origins of a preference are wiped from memory or become impossible to unearth, the preference might recover autonomous status. But our moral intuition often says otherwise: the legacy of slavery, caste and patriarchy can scar preferences long after their provenance is obscured. Second, not every causal influence counts as autonomy-subverting; we are all shaped by our upbringing, language, and culture. The challenge is to specify which historical factors matter. If the correct answer is \u201cthose involving unjust power,\u201d then we have already smuggled in a moralised content assessment\u2014oppression is morally bad\u2014though at the level of history.\n\n4. A relational enrichment of the historical view\n\nTo meet these worries, historical accounts can be supplemented by a relational conception of autonomy. On this picture, what robs adaptive preferences of autonomy is not merely that they were causally produced by oppression, but that they continue to function as vehicles through which oppressive social relations reproduce themselves. The preference for domesticity in a patriarchal society supports and normalises gender hierarchy; the preference for caste humility buttresses a system that degrades Dalits. The autonomy deficit is thus ongoing and relational, not merely genealogical. When the agent acts on such a preference, she is entangled in patterns of domination that limit her ability to subject those patterns to criticism. The history matters because it installs a set of social feedback mechanisms\u2014stigma, material dependence, threats of violence\u2014that block the dialogical processes of interrogation through which autonomous agency would otherwise flourish.\n\nThis relational-historical account both explains the persistence of the deficit and offers a principled boundary: only those causal influences that instantiate relations of domination undermine autonomy. Parents who instill in their children a love of music do not dominate them; but a culture that instills women with the conviction that higher education is sinful does dominate. The emphasis on domination resonates with the republican tradition (Pettit) and with feminists (Nedelsky, Oshana) who understand autonomy as insecure under conditions of structurally embedded power asymmetries. What the adaptive preference lacks, then, is not just authentic endorsement, nor just sound content, but freedom from an ongoing social relation that cripples the agent\u2019s critical capacities.\n\n5. Integrating subjectivist insights\n\nYet we should not jettison the internalist dimension altogether. Autonomy, after all, concerns self-rule; the phenomenology of owning one\u2019s desires is crucial. Historical-relational accounts must therefore explain why adaptive preferences often feel, from the inside, like genuine commitments. The explanation is psychological: oppressive socialisation shapes not only what we want but how we experience wanting. But the feeling of endorsement is epistemically defeasible. An agent may discover, through exposure to alternative viewpoints and solidaristic dialogue, that her second-order volitions are themselves artifacts of domination. Thus, while hierarchical endorsement is not sufficient for autonomy, the capacity for reflective revision remains necessary. Without it, we could not imagine agents emancipating themselves from adaptive preference structures, as countless feminist, anti-racist and queer liberation movements testify. \n\nA historical-relational theory can therefore incorporate a counterfactual endorsement condition: a preference is autonomous only if the agent could, in conditions free of domination and with adequate epistemic resources, sustain her endorsement. This \u201cconditions of exit\u201d criterion mirrors John Christman\u2019s suggestion that autonomy involves being able to revise one\u2019s preferences when furnished with critical information and social support. It guards against labeling as heteronomous every preference formed under non-ideal circumstances, focusing instead on whether the agent remains open to revising it once liberated from the disabling relation.\n\n6. Why content still matters, but modestly\n\nFinally, we must ask whether any room remains for content-based considerations. I submit that some contents, e.g., self-abnegation that renders dignified life impossible, are incompatible with the kinds of relationships that autonomy presupposes\u2014reciprocal recognition among free and equal persons. Even if a preference for one\u2019s own enslavement were formed without coercion (a fanciful possibility), it would express a stance that repudiates one\u2019s moral status as an equal. That status is among the background conditions for autonomy; repudiating it is a performative contradiction. Thus a thin, non-perfectionist content constraint piggybacks on the historical-relational view: certain preferences are autonomy-robbing because they deny the very normative standing in virtue of which one could be self-governing at all. However, the bar is set high: we invoke content only when it negates the agent\u2019s capacity for agency, not when it merely violates some observer\u2019s taste.\n\n7. Comparative evaluation\n\nWe are now in a position to assess the three accounts.\n\nSubjectivist endorsement:\n\u2022 Strength: highlights the internal perspective essential to self-rule; respects pluralism.\n\u2022 Weakness: cannot mark as heteronomous preferences whose higher-order endorsement is itself the creature of oppression; struggles with entrenched indoctrination.\n\nContent-based tests:\n\u2022 Strength: captures our intuition in extreme cases where what is preferred violates basic self-respect.\n\u2022 Weakness: lapses into moralism and cultural imperialism; fails to track the specific role of adaptive response to constraints; misclassifies independently vicious but freely chosen desires.\n\nHistorical-relational account:\n\u2022 Strength: targets the causal role of domination, explains persistence of autonomy deficits, avoids crude paternalism, dovetails with political analysis of oppression.\n\u2022 Weakness: needs supplementation to distinguish benign from malignant social influence; risks denying autonomy universally in a non-ideal world; lacks an internalist phenomenology unless enriched.\n\nWhen supplemented by counterfactual endorsement and a minimal content floor, the historical-relational model inherits the virtues and blunts the vices of its rivals. It shows why autonomy can be damaged without the agent\u2019s awareness, why not every strange or harmful desire is non-autonomous, and why emancipation politics rightly focuses on material and cultural transformation rather than on individual psychology alone.\n\n8. Implications for social policy and political theory\n\nSeeing autonomy through this lens also informs practical responses to adaptive preferences. If the deficit stems mainly from oppressive social relations, then the remedy is not (or not just) paternalistic interference with individual choices. It is collective action to dismantle the structures\u2014legal, economic, ideological\u2014that generate those preferences and keep agents from accessing genuine alternatives. Rather than barring the hijab or banning sex work outright under the banner of protecting women\u2019s autonomy, liberal states should secure conditions under which women can adopt or reject such practices without threat of violence, economic duress or social ostracism. That means education, material resources, robust anti-discrimination policy, and cultural contestation. In turn, development ethics should aim not simply to expand the menu of options (a purely capability-based metric) but to transform the relations that pre-arrange agents\u2019 option rankings in conformity with domination.\n\nConclusion\n\nAdaptive preferences unsettle familiar liberal pictures of autonomy because they reveal how deeply social power can seep into the wellsprings of desire. Subjectivist endorsement accounts cannot on their own apprehend that seepage; content-based accounts conflate moral appraisal with autonomy appraisal; historical accounts, properly refined, illuminate the core pathology, namely domination\u2019s capacity to colonise preference-formation itself. By combining a relational theory of social power with a counterfactual endorsement condition and a slender content constraint rooted in the very idea of equal moral standing, we gain an explanatory framework that respects individual phenomenology, diagnoses structural injustice, and guides emancipatory practice. Adaptive preferences are less than fully autonomous not because they fail to fit some observer\u2019s moral template, nor because their holders feel ambivalent, but because they are the living traces of domination that continues to stunt the agent\u2019s freedom even as it secures her consent. A philosophical theory that attends to that history and to those relations\u2014while granting the agent the ongoing capacity, under better conditions, to repudiate them\u2014gives the most convincing account of the autonomy at stake.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 10, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 3352, "reasoning_tokens": 128}

The Puzzle  \n\nOppression does not always announce itself as an external constraint.  Often it works by cultivating in the oppressed a set of desires that dovetail neatly with their restricted social position: the daughter who disavows her wish to study because \u201cgirls aren\u2019t good at maths,\u201d the agricultural labourer who declares that \u201ceducation is useless for people like us,\u201d or the woman in a village that practises female genital cutting who claims to \u201cprefer\u201d the operation.  Economists and feminist philosophers have labelled such desires adaptive preferences: they are preferences that arise, not in spite of the agent\u2019s limited options, but partly because the agent has those limits in view and adjusts her aspirations accordingly.  The intuitive thought is that the resulting preferences\u2014though sincerely held\u2014are less than fully autonomous.  But why?  Three families of answers dominate the literature:  \n\na. Subjectivist or procedural accounts, epitomised by Harry Frankfurt, locate autonomy in the agent\u2019s reflective endorsement of her first-order desires.  \nb. Content-based or substantive accounts hold that certain desires are disqualifying because of what they aim at.  \nc. Historical accounts insist that how a desire was formed matters: a preference bred by manipulation, coercion, or oppressive socialisation fails to be self-authored.  \n\nWhich of these approaches best diagnoses the autonomy deficit in adaptive preferences?  I argue that (i) purely procedural subjectivism under-diagnoses the deficit, (ii) purely content-based theories over-diagnose it, and (iii) a historically inflected, relational view gives the most precise explanation while avoiding paternalism.  To establish this, I first examine each account on its own terms and then show how a historical-relational synthesis preserves what is compelling in each while repairing their respective weaknesses.\n\n2. Subjectivist Procedural Accounts  \n\n2.1 Frankfurt\u2019s Hierarchy  \n\nFor Frankfurt, what distinguishes an autonomous action from a merely volitional one is the presence of a second-order volition that endorses the first-order desire on which the person acts.  A smoker who wants to quit but continues to smoke is not wholehearted.  Conversely, if after reflection she wholeheartedly embraces her smoking, her desire is autonomous, however destructive it may be.  The model is procedural: it does not scrutinise the content of what is desired, nor its causal history.  All that matters is a structure of reflective endorsement free of internal conflict.\n\n2.2 Applying the Model to Adaptive Preferences  \n\nIf a woman raised in a patriarchal setting reflectively endorses her desire to undergo genital cutting, Frankfurt would have to deem the desire autonomous\u2014provided it is indeed wholehearted.  The central worry is that the model counts too many adaptive preferences as self-authored merely because the agent has made peace with them.  The longer a person lives under oppressive norms, the more likely she is to endorse the desires those norms make salient; yet that convergence does not dispel the taint of oppression.\n\n2.3 Why Procedural Independence is Not Enough  \n\nDefenders of procedural accounts respond that what matters is whether reflection is free from direct coercion or deception at the moment of endorsement.  But adaptive preferences typically form in contexts where the agent\u2019s imagination of alternatives is systematically stunted long before reflection even begins.  To require that she now \u201cendorse\u201d the fragments left to her is a thin achievement.  Two Frankfurtian resources might be deployed to meet the objection:\n\na. Higher-order reflection could include a critical appraisal of how the first-order desire came about; if so, agents would repudiate desires they see as products of unjust constraints.  \nb. The notion of \u2018volitional necessity\u2019 could guard against coercively instilled second-order desires.\n\nYet in oppressive environments, agents often lack reliable information, social support, or conceptual tools to make such critical appraisals.  Their endorsement is therefore compromised even if it is internally conflict-free.  In short, a purely procedural test of authenticity confuses adaptive peace-of-mind with self-government.\n\n3. Content-Based Accounts  \n\n3.1 Substantive Autonomy Conditions  \n\nContent-based theorists, among them some feminist critics of proceduralism, argue that autonomy requires that what is chosen not be overly servile, self-abnegating, or otherwise morally objectionable.  On these views, a desire to be cut, enslaved, or permanently subordinate is disqualifying precisely because of its content: such desires are incompatible with the agent\u2019s equal moral worth.\n\n3.2 Strengths in Diagnosing Adaptive Preferences  \n\nContent-based standards capture an intuition that proceduralists miss: certain desires seem so deeply at odds with self-respect that they cannot be fully self-authored.  It is thus no accident that paradigmatic adaptive preferences\u2014preferences for genital cutting, for being fed last, for earning less than men\u2014are also desires whose realisation enacts or reinforces one\u2019s social inferiority.  The substantive view explains why adaptive preferences so readily strike outsiders as autonomy-defeating: the content of the preference itself embodies oppression.\n\n3.3 The Paternalism Objection  \n\nBut the power of this explanation is purchased at the price of paternalism.  Suppose a woman, well aware of the patriarchal roots of her culture, still sincerely prefers a domestic life.  A content-based theory that invalidates her choice because it is \u201ctoo traditional\u201d risks arrogating to the theorist the authority to decide which lives are worth choosing.  Moreover, the category of disqualifying desires is notoriously slippery: if a desire for genital cutting is non-autonomous, what about a desire for painful cosmetic surgery in liberal societies?  Content criteria threaten to slide into perfectionism or cultural imperialism.\n\n3.4 An Undergeneration Problem  \n\nIronically, the same account may under-generate autonomy failures when the content appears innocuous.  A preference for thin bread over thick bread, if adopted under duress or hypnosis, would still be non-autonomous even though nothing is morally suspect about thin bread.  So content alone cannot be the whole story.\n\n4. Historical Accounts  \n\n4.1 The Causal History Requirement  \n\nHistorical theories propose that whether a desire is autonomous depends on the causal pathway by which it was acquired.  If a preference is the product of deception, coercion, psychological manipulation, or oppressive socialisation, then it is heteronomous.  However wholeheartedly the subject now embraces it, the original vitiating conditions travel forward and infect present endorsement.\n\n4.2 Advantages Over Proceduralism  \n\nBy shifting attention from synchronic endorsement to diachronic formation, historical accounts can capture why adaptive preferences feel inauthentic.  The agent\u2019s preference is not simply made inferior by its content; nor is it redeemed by her current endorsement.  Rather, it is flawed because it traces to a formative process that systematically filtered out alternatives, distorted information, punished dissent, and rewarded compliance.  The sour-grapes fox is not self-governing because his shrinking of desire stems from earlier failed attempts and the anticipation of social ridicule.\n\n4.3 The Problem of Continuing Ownership  \n\nYet history alone does not settle everything.  We do not wish to say that every preference formed under bad conditions remains permanently tainted.  Many survivors of oppressive upbringing later take ownership of some of their inculcated desires after continuous critical dialogue with them; in doing so they seem to regain autonomy.  Historical accounts need criteria for \u201cimmunising\u201d a preference from its origins\u2014criteria that will inevitably involve some current capacities for critical reflection.  Thus historical and procedural elements converge.\n\n5. Comparative Diagnosis  \n\n5.1 Under- vs Over-Idealisation  \n\nSubjectivism sets the bar too low: wholehearted endorsement in conditions of entrenched oppression is insufficient for autonomy.  Content-based accounts set the bar too high: they risk declaring non-autonomous any desire that looks morally problematic from the theorist\u2019s standpoint.  Historical accounts occupy a middle ground, but they require supplementation to explain how present reflection can sometimes rehabilitate a tainted preference.\n\n5.2 Which Explains Adaptive Preferences Best?  \n\nConsider three test cases:  \n\nCase A: A woman in rural Sudan prefers genital cutting and endorses this preference after hearing only pro-cutting testimonies.  \nCase B: A well-educated woman in the same community, exposed to global human-rights discourse, still prefers the surgery as a mark of identity.  \nCase C: A woman in New York prefers Botox injections to appear youthful.\n\n\u2022 Proceduralism counts A and B autonomous (if endorsement is sincere) but cannot explain our stronger intuition of deficit in A than in B, or of any deficit at all in C.  \n\u2022 Content accounts count both A and B non-autonomous but must also impugn C unless they draw a contentious cultural line.  \n\u2022 Historical accounts diagnose A as non-autonomous because her preference was formed under massive epistemic deprivation and social control.  B is a harder case: some will judge that her broader exposure partly redeems the preference; others will note residual social pressures.  C, formed in a context of advertising manipulation but also robust alternatives and public critique, may come out autonomous.  The historical view can capture these nuances by examining the specific genealogy of each preference.\n\n6. Toward a Relational-Historical Account  \n\n6.1 Autonomy as Self-Authorship in Context  \n\nInstead of treating autonomy as a property of isolated preferences, a relational-historical account regards autonomy as an ongoing practice of self-authorship within social relations.  On this view, what matters is whether the agent (i) had access to a repertoire of live options, (ii) possessed the epistemic and emotional skills to assess them, (iii) operated in an environment that respected her deliberation, and (iv) retains the capacity to revise her commitments without punitive costs.\n\n6.2 Explaining Adaptive Preferences  \n\nAdaptive preferences fail these conditions in characteristic ways:\n\na. Restricted option set: oppressive structures narrow what the agent can even imagine desiring.  \nb. Distorted feedback: institutional and interpersonal signals punish deviation and reward conformity, impairing the agent\u2019s epistemic self-trust.  \nc. Cost prohibitions: choosing outside permissible roles brings threats to safety, economic survival, or social belonging.  \nd. Internalised affect: shame and guilt bind the agent affectively to the restricted role.\n\nBecause these features are historical and relational, the deficit they produce cannot be seen by looking solely at current psychological endorsement (proceduralism) or only at the intrinsic content of the desire (substantivism).  It is the way in which social power operates over time on the agent\u2019s capacities that undercuts autonomy.\n\n6.3 Normative Payoff  \n\nThe relational-historical account explains both why we should hesitate to override an agent\u2019s expressed preference and when we are justified in doing so.  If an intervention aims to expand her option set and deliberative capacities\u2014rather than to impose an alternative content\u2014it respects her autonomy better than simply accepting her adaptive preference at face value.  Moreover, it shows why paternalistic substitution of judgement is misguided: what the agent needs is empowerment of agency, not replacement of ends.\n\n7. An Objection: Are All Preferences Historically Contingent?  \n\nOne might object that every preference has a history of social influence; indeed, all desires are shaped by culture.  If historical impurity is disqualifying, then autonomy becomes impossible.  The relational-historical view answers that mere social influence is not the problem; the problem is a distinctive pattern of influence that systematically undermines the agent\u2019s capacities for critical reflection, imaginative freedom, and cost-effective revision.  Not every cultural shaping is autonomy-defeating, only oppressive shaping that closes rather than opens deliberative space.\n\n8. Conclusion  \n\nAdaptive preferences illustrate the subtle ways in which oppression colonises the will.  Purely procedural subjectivism mistakes reflective peace for self-government, while purely content-based theories mistake the moral quality of an end for the agent\u2019s authorship of it.  Historical accounts, sensitive to the genesis of desires, come closest to explaining the autonomy deficit, but they must be integrated into a broader relational framework that attends to the ongoing social conditions under which reflection, revision, and endorsement take place.  \n\nAutonomy, properly understood, is neither an instantaneous internal endorsement nor a matter of desiring the \u201cright\u201d things.  It is the lived capacity to navigate, criticise, and if necessary transform the social world that has shaped one\u2019s own identity.  Adaptive preferences are less than fully autonomous because they emerge from histories that cripple that capacity.

Introduction: adaptive preference and the intuitive autonomy worry  \n\nWhen Sen and Nussbaum speak of \u201cadaptive preferences,\u201d they have in mind the psychological tendency of agents to adjust their desires downward (or sideways) when the world denies them more attractive options. The classic examples are the fox who declares the grapes sour, the enslaved person who insists that servitude suits her, or the woman in a patriarchal village who claims not to want an education because \u201cit would only unsettle me.\u201d Observers feel an immediate tension. On the one hand these claims are the agent\u2019s own; on the other, we suspect something is missing \u2013 some element that would license us to say that the preference is fully her own. In other words, adaptive preferences appear to involve a deficit in autonomy. The philosophical task is to say what, exactly, the deficit consists in.\n\nThree families of accounts compete to articulate that deficit:\n\n\u2022 Subjectivist or structural accounts, exemplified by Frankfurt\u2019s hierarchical theory, focus on whether the agent reflectively endorses the preference.  \n\u2022 Content-based or substantive accounts judge the preference by the moral quality of what is preferred.  \n\u2022 Historical or procedural\u2013etiological accounts emphasise how the preference was formed and whether the formative process was itself autonomous.\n\nI will argue that historical\u2013relational accounts ultimately identify the autonomy deficit most convincingly, yet that they are strengthened when they borrow insights from the other two traditions. The argument proceeds as follows. \u00a72 reconstructs the subjectivist model and notes its vulnerability to internalised oppression. \u00a73 shows why purely content-based criteria cannot capture the phenomenon without lapsing into moralism. \u00a74 develops the historical alternative and explains how oppressive socialisation damages autonomy. \u00a75 replies to objections that the historical criterion over-pathologises ordinary social influence and collapses into scepticism. \u00a76 briefly sketches an integrated view that preserves the merits of each approach.\n\n2. The subjectivist or structural model: endorsement and its limits  \n\nHarry Frankfurt\u2019s canonical picture portrays autonomy as a matter of hierarchical identification. My first-order desires push me toward various actions; my second-order volitions express which of those motivational states I *want* to move me. If I want to want to study, and that higher-order commitment effectively governs my motivational economy, then the ensuing study session is autonomous; if the higher-order desire is absent or alienated, it is not. The attraction of Frankfurt\u2019s view is its anti-paternalist stance: it looks entirely to the subject\u2019s reflective attitudes, not to external standards or to causal histories the agent herself repudiates.  \n\nApplying this model to adaptive preference, an agent who has come to prefer traditional domesticity over education could in principle autonomously endorse that preference at the second order. Suppose she spends a week in calm self-scrutiny and ends up wholeheartedly identifying with her domestic aspirations. On Frankfurt\u2019s account, the preference is then autonomous, even if outsiders suspect patriarchy did the shaping.\n\nThat conclusion is precisely what many feminist theorists find counter-intuitive. Our worry about the village woman was not that she lacked second-order reflection: she might well endorse the domestic ideal with passionate sincerity. Our worry was rather that her horizon of reflection was itself distorted by oppressive norms; the preferences available for endorsement had been filtered before reflection began. Thus, the purely hierarchical model seems to misfire in two ways.\n\nFirst, it is too quick to treat any higher-order endorsement as sufficing for autonomy, ignoring that reflective capacities themselves are socially conditioned. Someone trained never to imagine herself as a lawyer may endorse her domestic role, but the endorsement issues from a stunted imaginative repertoire. Second, the Frankfurtian agent is conceived in isolation, such that background power relations vanish from view. When internalised oppression becomes invisible, the model risks legitimating domination.\n\nFrankfurt acknowledged a \u201cregress problem\u201d (\u201cwhy should third-order desires not be required?\u201d), but he believed it was solvable by an appeal to wholeheartedness. The feminist objection, however, is not about regress but about the inputs to reflection: they have been filtered by unequal power. Hence structural endorsement is at best a necessary condition; it is not sufficient to diagnose autonomy in cases of adaptive preference.\n\n3. Content-based or substantive accounts: autonomy and the moral worth of ends  \n\nA second strategy, advanced in distinct registers by Nussbaum, Raz, and sometimes Kantian liberals, holds that a preference is non-autonomous if its content flouts certain objective requirements of flourishing or moral right. Nussbaum\u2019s capability approach, for example, speaks of \u201cdeformed desires\u201d when a person prefers what leaves her below a threshold of central human capacities. On this view the village woman\u2019s preference for illiteracy marks a failure of autonomy because literacy is intrinsically valuable to human agency.\n\nContent-based criteria have intuitive bite: they capture cases where an agent calmly wants something that will obviously harm or demean her. Still, the approach faces two challenges.\n\na) The paternalism challenge. By measuring autonomy directly against a list of objective goods, the theorist risks collapsing the distinction between respecting a person\u2019s choices and evaluating their wisdom. Autonomy traditionally tracks self-rule, not moral rightness. To brand any immoral or imprudent choice ipso facto non-autonomous flattens the conceptual landscape: Socrates\u2019 choice to remain in Athens, knowing it will lead to execution, flouts prudence but hardly seems heteronomous.\n\nb) The possibility of morally neutral yet adaptive preferences. A woman who prefers milder spices because she cannot afford the expensive hot ones exhibits an adaptive preference that looks autonomy-deficient even though the content is ethically neutral. If content alone were decisive, this case would pose no problem, yet the intuitive deficit persists.\n\nProponents reply that some content-based threshold\u2014e.g., basic capabilities\u2014is only a \u201cfloor\u201d for full autonomy; above it, individuals may vary freely. This mitigates the paternalism worry but concedes that content alone cannot explain *all* autonomy deficits. We still need a story about process and history.\n\n4. Historical\u2013relational accounts: tracing the genealogy of preference  \n\nHistorical accounts contend that whether a preference is autonomous depends crucially on the conditions under which it was formed. An early version appears in Gerald Dworkin\u2019s requirement that an agent have had \u201cthe capacity and opportunity for critical reflection\u201d at the time of acquisition. Contemporary feminist authors\u2014Meyers, Oshana, Benson, and especially Natalie Stoljar\u2014sharpen this idea by emphasising the *relational* nature of autonomy. They insist that social power can so structure formative experiences that certain preferences, though reflectively endorsed, remain products of domination. On this view, the village woman\u2019s preference is less than fully autonomous because it was inculcated by a patriarchal environment that systematically limited her imaginative and practical opportunities.\n\nSeveral features make the historical approach attractive.\n\na) It explains why wholehearted endorsement may nonetheless be suspect. If endorsement results from earlier deprivation of alternatives, that endorsement inherits the taint. A child raised never to see a library cannot later, as an adult, disclaim the formative deprivation by a mere act of will.\n\nb) It dissociates the autonomy verdict from the moral value of content. Even a morally innocuous preference (for mild spices) can be autonomy-deficient if it arose through coercive deprivation.\n\nc) It accommodates degrees of autonomy. Because formative influences vary in their oppressiveness, preferences can be more or less autonomous, matching our intuitions that adaptive preferences lie on a continuum.\n\nTo make the model precise, however, we need criteria for when social influence crosses the line into autonomy-undermining oppression. Two complementary proposals appear in the literature.\n\ni) Coercion and manipulation. A formative process is disqualifying if it involved coercion, threats, or manipulation that bypassed the agent\u2019s critical faculties. The difficulty here is that many adaptive preferences develop without overt coercion; subtle cultural messages suffice.\n\nii) Systematic deprivation of options. Stoljar\u2019s \u201cconstraint view\u201d therefore adds that a preference is non-autonomous if, during its formation, the agent lacked access to a range of *feasible* alternatives that would have appeared choice-worthy under minimally decent social conditions. This criterion shifts the emphasis from psychological interference to the objective structure of opportunity.\n\nCritics raise two worries. First, ordinary socialisation always limits the range of imaginable options; does the constraint view imply that no one is fully autonomous? Second, the further back we trace etiological lines, the more pervasive domination seems; how can the agent ever regain self-ownership?\n\n5. Objections and replies  \n\n5.1 The over-breadth objection  \n\nIf every social influence that shapes preference counted as autonomy-defeating, the concept of autonomy would empty out. But relational theorists need not adopt such a sweeping stance. The key distinction is not between \u201cinfluence\u201d and \u201cno influence\u201d but between *legitimate* and *illegitimate* influence. Socialisation undermines autonomy when:\n\n\u2022 it is systematically aimed at limiting a class of people\u2019s aspirations, and  \n\u2022 it blocks or penalises the exercise of critical reflection on that limitation.\n\nUnder these conditions the formative process is not merely *shaping* but *dominating*. The comparison with democratic persuasion helps: learning civic virtues through discussion informs without foreclosing, whereas patriarchal conditioning forecloses before discussion can occur.\n\n5.2 The historical scepticism objection  \n\nSuppose my current preference for philosophy was partly shaped by a charismatic teacher I encountered by chance. Had I met a different mentor, I might prefer biology. Does that contingency undermine my autonomy? Historical theorists reply that contingency alone is not autonomy-defeating; what matters is whether the influence operated through oppressive mechanisms. Chance is consistent with autonomy; domination is not.\n\n5.3 The diachronic redemption objection  \n\nCan agents autonomously endorse a once-adaptive preference after later critical reflection? Imagine the village woman migrates, encounters diverse options, and *still* prefers domesticity. Many historical theorists allow that subsequent, well-informed reflection can rehabilitate the preference. The autonomy deficit is not metaphysically permanent; it persists only while the causal history remains epistemically hidden or its oppressive roots unacknowledged. Once the agent knowingly re-endorses the preference in a context of genuine alternatives, autonomy is restored.\n\n6. Toward an integrated account  \n\nAlthough the historical-relational model best captures the intuitive deficit of adaptive preferences, it benefits from borrowing two insights:\n\nFrom the subjectivist camp it should keep the endorsement requirement. Even after oppressive formation, autonomy cannot be ascribed unless the agent now identifies with the preference. Conversely, if she repudiates it, the preference ceases to express her agency, however benign its history.\n\nFrom the content-based camp it can adopt a *threshold of practical possibility*. Some preferences\u2014e.g., for self-mutilation under duress\u2014so deeply injure basic capacities that no process, however benign, could ratify them as autonomous. Thus content places outer bounds on what can count as self-rule.\n\nThe synthesis yields a tripartite test:\n\nA preference P of agent A is fully autonomous only if:\n\n1. Endorsement: A presently identifies with P after reflectively scrutinising it.  \n2. History: P was not formed, nor is it now sustained, by social processes that systematically deprived A of access to relevant alternatives or silenced critical reflection.  \n3. Content floor: P does not condemn A to a life beneath the threshold of basic capabilities required for further exercises of autonomy.\n\nAdaptive preferences typically fail at least condition (2) and sometimes (3), even when (1) is satisfied, thereby illuminating their autonomy deficit without erasing the possibility of future redemption.\n\n7. Conclusion  \n\nWhy are adaptive preferences\u2014those moulded by constrained options\u2014less than fully autonomous? Subjectivist structural models stall because they ignore oppressive background conditions; content-based models veer toward paternalism and cannot explain valence-neutral cases. Historical\u2013relational accounts, by contrast, trace the deficit to the formative context of domination that narrows imagination and forecloses critical possibilities. Their power lies in recognising that autonomy is not a momentary property of isolated wills but a temporally extended achievement dependent on social arrangements. Still, a complete theory should retain the structural requirement of endorsement and a minimal content constraint to protect the very possibility of future self-rule. The resulting integrated view vindicates our intuition: when agents adapt their desires to unjust constraints, something has gone wrong with self-government\u2014not because their wills lack internal harmony, nor merely because their ends are unworthy, but because the social world has denied them the freedom to want otherwise.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 12, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 2897, "reasoning_tokens": 256}

Introduction  \n\nSomeone who grows up in a drought-ridden region may come to like the taste of brackish water; a woman in a patriarchal society may develop a genuine preference for being her husband\u2019s unpaid helper; a member of a disadvantaged caste may decide that \u201cpeople like me\u201d should not aspire to university.  In each case the preference is \u201cadaptive\u201d in Jon Elster\u2019s sense: it is shaped in response to what appears feasible, the way the fox in Aesop\u2019s fable declares the unreachable grapes sour.  Many philosophers and economists regard such preferences as problematic, especially when they arise under conditions of oppression.  But what, exactly, is wrong with them?  More precisely: in what sense are adaptive preferences less than fully autonomous?  \n\nThis question is pressing because liberal political theory ordinarily treats a person\u2019s own informed, voluntary choices as the touchstone of respect.  If autonomy is our lodestar, yet many people endorse preferences that seem to perpetuate their own subordination, we need an account that explains how autonomy can be compromised without collapsing into perfectionist paternalism.  Three broad families of answers dominate the literature:  \n\na) Subjectivist or procedural accounts, epitomised by Harry Frankfurt\u2019s hierarchical model, locate autonomy in a structure of desires and higher-order endorsements, independent of substantive content.  \n\nb) Content-based accounts claim that certain preferences are autonomy-defeating because their very object is incompatible with, for instance, self-respect or equal moral standing.  \n\nc) Historical or relational accounts look to the causal story behind the preference\u2014its genesis in social power relations, manipulation, or restricted options\u2014to diagnose autonomy deficits.  \n\nI shall argue, first, that the adaptive-preference phenomenon exposes the limitations of pure subjectivism; second, that although content restrictions capture an important moral intuition, they risk mere moralism unless connected to a story about how content and formation interact; and third, that a suitably developed historical-relational view gives the most compelling explanation of why preferences moulded by oppressive constraints fail to be fully autonomous, while also allowing space for rational, innocuous, or even admirable forms of adaptation.\n\n2.  Autonomy and the Challenge from Adaptation  \n\nThe standard liberal ideal depicts the autonomous agent as someone who acts on reasons she has reflectively endorsed.  But reflection is costly, information is incomplete, and social cues are potent.  Adaptive preferences highlight the fact that reflection can be itself shaped by circumstance: severe or lasting constraints narrow not only what we can do but what we can imagine wanting.  If, as Amartya Sen quips, the chronically under-nourished often \u201cchoose\u201d not to need more food, the worry is not that they are irrational; rather, their choosing seems under the shadow of an oppressive history.  The philosophical task is to explicate this sense of \u201cunder the shadow\u201d without simply declaring their preferences invalid because we disapprove of them.\n\n3.  Subjectivist (Procedural) Accounts  \n\n3.1  Frankfurt\u2019s hierarchical model  \n\nAccording to Frankfurt, a person is autonomous when she acts on first-order desires (wanting to cook, say) that she endorses via second-order volitions (wanting to want to cook).  Autonomy is internal coherence: the higher-order self stamps its approval on the lower-order impulses.  The content of the desire, or its empirical origin, is irrelevant provided the endorsement is wholehearted.  \n\n3.2  The adaptive-preference counter-example  \n\nConsider Sita, who lives in a rural area where girls\u2019 schooling past age twelve is virtually impossible.  Over time she forms a desire to quit school and devote herself to domestic chores.  Suppose further that she reflectively endorses this desire: she \u201cwants to want\u201d to stay home.  On Frankfurt\u2019s view Sita is autonomous.  Nevertheless many of us feel that something is amiss: her preference was sculpted by oppressive gender norms and the absence of alternatives.  Frankfurt cannot register that deficit because his model lacks any \u201cindependence condition\u201d that screens off endorsements produced by manipulation, socialisation, or adaptive resignation.  \n\n3.3  Procedural refinements and their limits  \n\nOne might try to patch subjectivism by adding filters: the preference must be formed under conditions of adequate information (Meyers), free from coercion (Benson), or in the absence of \u201cself-sabotaging attitudes\u201d (Friedman).  Yet these refinements either slide toward a historical story (how did the information deficit or coercion affect formation?) or beg the question (what counts as sabotage?).  In paradigmatic adaptive cases, the agent often is well informed and not under direct coercion; what she lacks is a social world that would make alternative aspirations psychologically live options.  Subjectivism, even with bells and whistles, struggles to capture that subtler background dependence.\n\n4.  Content-Based Accounts  \n\n4.1  The moralised conception  \n\nSome philosophers, notably those influenced by feminist and republican traditions, contend that autonomy must involve more than procedural self-endorsement: the content of the preference must respect the agent\u2019s own worth, or at least be compatible with her having equal moral standing.  If a woman endorses a preference for servility, the very servile content negates autonomy.  Similarly, a preference forged to accept degrading work or genital cutting is autonomy-defeating by virtue of what is preferred.\n\n4.2  Strengths  \n\nThis picture speaks directly to our intuitions.  It avoids the Frankfurtian blind spot by insisting that certain valuations\u2014of oneself as inferior, or of oppressive practices as desirable\u2014are incompatible with genuine self-rule.\n\n4.3  Problems  \n\na) Paternalism: Content criteria risk sliding into perfectionism.  An ascetic monk who freely and reflectively chooses extreme self-denial might fail the content test, yet many would call him autonomous.  \n\nb) Ambiguity: Which contents violate autonomy?  Is high-risk sport autonomy-defeating?  How about commercial surrogacy?  Without a principled limit content tests become moralistic.  \n\nc) Etiology again creeps in: Often we think a servility preference is autonomy-defective because it was inculcated by oppressive norms.  If the same content arose through independent, creative experimentation, we might judge differently.  That suggests historical factors are doing the real explanatory work.\n\n5.  Historical (Relational) Accounts  \n\n5.1  The Core Idea  \n\nHistorical theories, developed by Gerald Dworkin, John Christman, Marina Oshana, Diana Meyers, and others, claim that autonomy depends on the way a preference was produced.  Roughly, a desire is autonomous if it originates (or can be sustained) through processes that respect the agent\u2019s critical capacities and basic interests, and if it is not the upshot of manipulation, coercive socialisation, or severe deprivation.\n\n5.2  How the account explains adaptive preferences  \n\nAdaptive preferences, by definition, arise under restrictive circumstances.  Historical theorists analyse those circumstances relationally:  \n\n\u2022  Coercion and threat (explicit force, legal penalties).  \n\n\u2022  Structural oppression (systemic barriers, unequal power, internalised devaluation).  \n\n\u2022  Deprivation of options so severe that alternative aspirations are psychologically invisible (Nussbaum\u2019s \u201cthick veil of ignorance\u201d).  \n\nIn Sita\u2019s case, patriarchy and poverty not only limit feasible choice; they guide socialisation\u2014teachers stop encouraging girls, parents praise compliance\u2014so that the preference is the predictable, and perhaps the only psychologically comfortable, response.  On the historical account, that process undermines autonomy even when firsthand coercion is absent and the content is not flagrantly degrading.  What matters is that Sita\u2019s preference would almost certainly have been different had she grown up with genuine opportunities for education; the causal path leading to her endorsement ran through oppressive filters that stunted reflective possibilities.\n\n5.3  Virtues of the approach  \n\na) Etiological sensitivity: It explicates the \u201cshadow of oppression\u201d without ruling out adaptive but innocuous preferences\u2014liking brackish water, say\u2014when constraints are benign or natural rather than imposed by power.  \n\nb) Compatibility with agency: It does not portray the agent as a passive victim; people can reflectively endorse their adapted tastes, and to that extent exert agency, but the account still registers a loss of freedom attributable to social conditions, not to the individual\u2019s rational failure.  \n\nc) Normative traction without paternalism: Because the flaw lies in the harmful process, not merely the content, the historical view can justify ameliorative intervention (expanding educational opportunities, challenging sexist norms) while leaving ultimate authority with persons once genuine options are restored.\n\n5.4  Objections and replies  \n\nObjection 1: Some preferences with oppressive histories (e.g., the taste for meat in many cultures) are treated as autonomous\u2014so the historical criterion must be selective.  \nReply: The relevant history must involve a freedom-subverting mechanism aimed specifically at the agent\u2019s subordinate status.  Meat-eating reflects cultural habit, but not usually a project of subordination directed at the eater.  \n\nObjection 2: Past manipulation can be so pervasive that no preference escapes.  The criterion then becomes too demanding.  \nReply: Historical accounts typically include a \u201csatisfaction\u201d clause: if the agent, under conditions of expanded options and critical reflection, would not wish to revise the preference, it may regain autonomous status.  This forward-looking element prevents paralysis.\n\n6.  Toward a Nuanced Historical-Procedural Account  \n\nPure historical dependence is not enough; after all, many preferences originate in childhood socialisation, a form of dependency we do not normally view as autonomy-defeating.  What distinguishes oppressive adaptation is (i) the absence of viable alternatives at the formative stage, and (ii) the plausibility that the agent would revise the preference under conditions that protected her deliberative capacities and offered genuinely better options.  Thus a hybrid view seems warranted:\n\nCondition A (Procedural): The agent currently reflects on her preference without coercion or deception, has adequate information, and is minimally competent to assess reasons.\n\nCondition B (Historical-Relational): The genesis of the preference did not systematically block, demean, or distort the agent\u2019s capacity for valuing herself as an equal member of the moral community; or, if it did, the agent has since had a fair opportunity to reconsider it after those constraints were lifted.\n\nIf either condition fails, autonomy is impaired.  Adaptive preferences that arise amid entrenched oppression will typically violate B; some might also violate A if internalised self-doubt hampers critical reflection.\n\n7.  Illustrative Cases  \n\nCase 1: The Satisfied Housewife (classic in the literature).  She happily endorses staying at home because systemic sexism made alternative careers unimaginable.  Condition B fails\u2014her preference was formed under demeaning norms and without exposure to viable careers.  Hence autonomy deficit.\n\nCase 2: The Amateur Gardener.  Climate change forces a farmer to switch from rice to drought-resistant millet; she comes to prefer millet dishes.  No oppressive mechanism targets her.  Condition B is met; adaptation is autonomous.\n\nCase 3: The High-Risk Laborer.  An undocumented migrant \u201cchooses\u201d hazardous work because all legal jobs are closed to him.  His preference for danger pay is shaped by coercive legal exclusion.  Autonomy impaired; policy response should aim at opening broader employment options, not necessarily overriding his immediate choice, but ensuring future choices can be genuinely his.\n\n8.  Reconsidering Subjectivism and Content in Light of History  \n\nHistorical accounts do not render procedural endorsement and content irrelevant; rather, they re-interpret their significance.  Endorsement matters because it reveals the agent\u2019s present-tense authority; content matters because certain desires (e.g., for one\u2019s own degradation) are most plausibly explained by oppressive histories.  But neither alone diagnoses the autonomy deficit.  The hierarchy of desires can be hijacked by social conditioning; demeaning content can be freely adopted.  Only by looking at the interaction among formation, endorsement, and content do we grasp the distinctive wrong of adaptive preferences in oppressive settings.\n\n9.  Policy and Ethical Implications  \n\nIf historical-relational analysis is correct, interventions should target structural conditions, not the agent\u2019s choice per se.  The goal is to expand real possibilities\u2014education, healthcare, legal rights\u2014while refraining from substituting the intervener\u2019s judgment for the agent\u2019s when those possibilities become available.  This stance navigates between paternalism and moral indifference: it justifies welfare programs, anti-discrimination laws, and cultural critique, yet respects individuals\u2019 subsequent informed endorsements, even of lifestyles outsiders might deem inferior.\n\n10.  Conclusion  \n\nAdaptive preferences expose the tension between respecting persons as choosers and acknowledging how social power shapes what is chosen.  Purely subjective accounts, fixated on internal endorsement, miss the structural pathways through which deprivation and domination infiltrate the will.  Purely content-based bans risk moralistic overreach.  A historically informed, relational concept of autonomy\u2014one that assesses when and how preferences were formed, and whether agents have had genuine opportunities to revisit them\u2014best explains why some adaptive preferences are less than fully autonomous.\n\nSuch an account vindicates our intuition that the satisfied housewife is not fully the author of her preference, while the gardener adapting to climate might be.  It thereby offers both a diagnostic tool for theorists of justice and a normative guide for policy: transform oppressive conditions so that what people come to like is truly of their own making.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 13, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 3320, "reasoning_tokens": 448}

A village girl who comes to \u201cprefer\u201d early marriage because no other economically secure future is imaginable, or a member of a persecuted caste who sincerely prefers tasks judged menial by a wider society, represents a puzzle: the preferences are genuinely hers, yet many of us hesitate to describe them as fully autonomous.  Why?  Three broad families of answers have been proposed.\n\n1.  Subjectivist or procedural accounts (notably Harry Frankfurt\u2019s hierarchical model) ground autonomy in the right kind of internal endorsement relation among an agent\u2019s mental states.\n\n2.  Content-based or substantive accounts locate the problem in what the agent prefers; a preference for domination, degradation or self-harm is itself a sign of diminished autonomy.\n\n3.  Historical accounts explain the deficit by reference to how the preference was formed, emphasising indoctrination, coercion or the absence of critical alternatives.\n\nEach view captures part of what is disturbing about adaptive preference, but none is sufficient on its own.  After examining their respective merits and limitations, I shall argue that the autonomy shortfall is best diagnosed by a hybrid that is primarily historical\u2014focused on socialisation under unjust constraints\u2014but is supplemented by procedural requirements of critical reflection and, at the limit, by a modest substantive threshold.  Only such a layered view can do justice both to our egalitarian reluctance to label the oppressed as simply non-autonomous and to our moral intuition that a preference can be too thoroughly moulded by injustice to count as fully self-governing.\n\nI.  The subjectivist route: higher-order endorsement and its fragility\n\nFrankfurt\u2019s influential model locates autonomy in the structure of volition.  A person acts freely when she is moved by a first-order desire that she endorses at the higher level\u2014when she wants to be moved by that desire.  At first glance, the model seems well suited to vindicate adaptive preferences: if the girl wholeheartedly embraces her wish to marry at fourteen, hierarchically endorsing that wish, then her preference counts as autonomous.  Frankfurt\u2019s theory is scrupulously neutral about content and origin; it is indifferent to how the desire got there, so long as the agent in the present identifies with it.\n\nThe neutrality is a strength if one\u2019s aim is to protect pluralism, but it supplies little grip on the case of oppression.  Critics have pressed two objections.\n\nA.  Endorsement may itself be adaptively manufactured.  Under severe constraint, higher-order approval of the available options is often the only psychologically bearable stance\u2014what Elster calls \u201csour grapes\u201d and Amartya Sen \u201cthe ordeal of utilitarianism.\u201d  The mind buffs the edges of external deprivation by making peace with it.  If such reconciliation is sufficient for full autonomy, we license a disturbing moral complacency: the oppressed are seen as freely preferring their lot, providing an alibi for injustice.\n\nB.  Procedural accounts ignore the background conditions of reflection.  Real endorsement requires the capacity to imagine alternatives and to test one\u2019s commitments against evidence and argument.  But oppression systematically blocks access to information, role models and discursive spaces.  The very ability to mount a second-order critique is socially distributed.  Therefore, Lisa Tessman and Marina Oshana insist, endorsement obtained in a context of impoverished horizons is pro tanto suspect.\n\nFrankfurt can reply that not every alignment of first- and second-order desires counts: higher-order volitions must flow from \u201ccaring,\u201d an ongoing concern with the self\u2019s practical identity, and must emerge from a capacity for critical reflection.  Yet once the door is opened to such background conditions, the subjectivist becomes entangled in the historical and social story she tried to avoid.  The model\u2019s explanatory power in cases of adaptive preference thus wanes.\n\nII.  Content-based accounts: objective values and the charge of paternalism\n\nMartha Nussbaum\u2019s capabilities approach, and earlier perfectionist strands in liberalism, treat autonomy as partly a matter of what one chooses.  Certain functions\u2014bodily integrity, education, political participation, freedom from humiliation\u2014are so central to human flourishing that a settled preference to forego them betrays an autonomy deficit.  According to this view, a girl who \u201cchooses\u201d early marriage is not governing herself but is rather a casualty of circumstances that deprive her of a valuable capability: healthy maturation and informed life planning.\n\nThe advantage here is clarity: oppressive preferences look non-autonomous because their content incorporates subordination.  Furthermore, the moral weight of what is preferred explains why we are less troubled by the person who adapts her lunch choice to a short menu than by the woman who adapts her aspirations to sexist norms.  However, two difficulties loom.\n\nA.  Paternalism and pluralism.  The substantive view risks labelling any preference that departs from the specified list of goods as non-autonomous.  Yet moral disagreement about the good life is deep and reasonable.  The charge is especially acute in cross-cultural contexts: to deem the head-scarved woman non-autonomous because she embraces modesty skates perilously close to ethnocentrism.\n\nB.  The missing link to oppression.  Content alone cannot separate adaptive from merely unconventional desires.  A Zen monk may freely prefer poverty and silence; content-based criteria would unjustly demote his autonomy.  What matters is not only that the content is self-effacing but that the preference was shaped by constraint or domination.  Thus, a content-only story either overgeneralises or must, tacitly, smuggle in historical considerations.\n\nIII.  Historical accounts: the formative story and structural injustice\n\nHistorical or \u201cetiological\u201d theories, advanced by Gerald Dworkin, Alfred Mele, John Christman and more recently by relational autonomy theorists, hold that freedom is undermined when preferences are formed through processes that bypass the agent\u2019s critical capacities\u2014coercion, manipulation, brainwashing, or, in subtler cases, sustained socialisation under oppressive norms.  On Christman\u2019s \u201creflective endorsement\u201d variant, a desire is autonomous if the agent would not disavow it after sustained, informed reflection free of external interference.  What matters is whether the actual preference arises from a history that leaves intact the agent\u2019s counterfactual capacity to evaluate and revise it.\n\nApplied to adaptive preferences, the historical view explains our ambivalence: we sense that the girl raised in a context where no viable alternative to early marriage was presented could not, even under ideal reflection, distance herself from that desire, because the formative history truncated her imaginative repertoire.  The autonomy deficit is thus not grounded in her current endorsement (she has that) nor necessarily in the content (marriage is not inherently degrading) but in the causal pathway that embedded the preference.\n\nHistorical accounts have notable strengths:\n\n1.  They respect pluralism; if a preference for a sparse, ascetic life grows from voluntary reflection rather than indoctrination, the theory counts it as autonomous even if it deviates from mainstream values.\n\n2.  They dovetail with feminist insights about power: the same preference can be autonomous for one person and adaptive for another, depending on structural context.\n\nYet they face two challenges.\n\nA.  How oppressive must the history be?  All preferences are socially shaped.  Drawing the line between acceptable socialisation and autonomy-undermining indoctrination is non-trivial.  Demanding a pristine genealogy would make autonomy nearly impossible.\n\nB.  The epistemic burden.  To determine autonomy we need to speculate about hypothetical reflection scenarios: would the agent, in an ideal environment, repudiate the preference?  Such counterfactuals are hard to ground evidentially without lapsing into paternal projection.\n\nIV.  Comparative evaluation through examples\n\nConsider two cases that feminists often cite.\n\n1.  Child marriage in rural Rajasthan.  Girls typically leave school by age twelve and marry by fourteen.  Many express excitement at becoming wives, citing security and social honour.\n\n2.  Voluntary headscarf wearing by adult, educated Muslim women in Paris.  Some report that the hijab expresses piety and feminist resistance to objectification.\n\nThe subjectivist account risks conflating the two: both groups appear to endorse their choice.  A content-based theory might condemn both, or neither, depending on whether marriage at fourteen or wearing the hijab is judged incompatible with human flourishing.  A historical account discriminates better.  The child bride\u2019s preference emerges in a context that systematically forecloses alternatives through economic dependence and cultural coercion; the Parisian student, by contrast, confronted plural models of femininity and still chose the scarf.  While empirical details matter, the historical lens offers the conceptual resources to draw the intuitive distinction.\n\nV.  Why a purely historical account still needs supplementation\n\nDespite its advantages, the historical approach inherits a version of the \u201csour grapes\u201d worry.  Some adaptive preferences are formed gradually, with no dramatic coercion, through myriad micro-interactions: media portrayals, absence of role models, subtle social rewards.  Whether this lineage invalidates autonomy is ambiguous.  Moreover, even if we accept a broadly historical threshold, we must articulate what, concretely, counts as a defective formation process.  Here the other two dimensions\u2014procedural reflection and substantive goods\u2014can assist.\n\n1.  Procedural supplementation.  The capacity for critical imagination is itself a function of social opportunities.  We might require that, at some point, the agent had genuine access to spaces of dialogue and models of alternative life plans.  This injects Frankfurt-style endorsement but with a social twist: the question is not merely whether I endorse my desire, but whether I could have formed second-order attitudes under conditions of adequate informational and deliberative resources.  It incorporates the epistemic dimension without reducing autonomy to present assent.\n\n2.  Substantive floor.  Even where historical conditions are decent, there are some preferences\u2014say, for one\u2019s own slavery or bodily mutilation\u2014whose content is so antithetical to agency that endorsing them signals a compromised self-relation.  A thin capabilities list, oriented toward maintaining the practical preconditions of personhood (bodily integrity, minimal education, legal status as a right-holder), can play this backstop role.  Importantly, the bar is low enough to avoid much of the pluralist worry; it does not dictate a comprehensive conception of the good, only the ingredients necessary to keep the space of practical reasoning itself open.  Call this a \u201creflexive substantive constraint.\u201d\n\nVI.  The resulting hybrid: relational autonomy and adaptive preference\n\nOn the proposed hybrid, a preference counts as less than fully autonomous when:\n\na.  It is traceable to a history of oppression or severe limitation that curtails exposure to alternatives (historical core).\n\nb.  The agent lacked, or continues to lack, adequate opportunities for critical reflection with diverse information and interlocutors (procedural supplement).\n\nc.  The preference, if implemented, would erode the agent\u2019s ongoing capacity to shape her life narrative (substantive floor).\n\nEach condition is jointly sufficient; together they map closely onto paradigmatic adaptive preferences under oppression.  The girl\u2019s wish for child marriage satisfies all three; the adult\u2019s wish to wear the hijab likely fails (b) and (c), hence can remain autonomous unless specific empirical details reveal intense coercion.\n\nVII.  Addressing common objections\n\n1.  The line-drawing worry: Doesn\u2019t every preference pass through a social filter?  Yes, but not every social filter is autonomy-defeating.  The hybrid digs for asymmetries: systematic disempowerment, the silencing of critique, and content that corrodes future agency.  Social influence becomes autonomy-eroding only when it clusters along those axes.\n\n2.  The paternalism worry: Are we not imposing our own liberal values?  The substantive floor is intentionally minimal and instrumental, aimed at safeguarding the conditions for self-direction rather than any particular life plan.  Recognising that a preference to be someone\u2019s chattel is incompatible with autonomy is not paternalistic but definitional.\n\n3.  The epistemic access worry: How do we know a preference\u2019s history?  Perfect knowledge is impossible, yet we routinely make reasonably reliable judgments using sociological data, first-person testimony and the palpable presence of structural domination.  Law and policy already rely on such imperfect but workable assessments (for instance, in determining undue influence in contracts).\n\nVIII.  Implications for policy and moral responsibility\n\nDiagnosing adaptive preferences as non-autonomous has practical stakes.  Should we intervene?  Blunt interventions risk violating the agent\u2019s remaining autonomy; wholesale disregard perpetuates oppression.  The hybrid suggests a middle path: ameliorative measures ought to concentrate on expanding the agent\u2019s capacity for reflection and on dismantling structural constraints, rather than on coercively replacing her preferences.\n\nIn educational policy, this means guaranteeing access to robust schooling for girls; in political activism, ensuring safe public spheres for dissent; in health contexts, offering counselling that explores alternatives without shaming the patient.  Over time, such empowerment may lead the agent to revise her adaptive preference\u2014or to reaffirm it, now more autonomously.  Either outcome respects her personhood.\n\nMoral responsibility also shifts.  If an agent\u2019s preference is shown to be adaptively formed under oppression, her responsibility for actions flowing from it is mitigated.  Yet we need not deny her agency altogether; the hybrid recognises partial autonomy.  This stance avoids both victim-blaming and the infantilisation of the oppressed.\n\nIX.  Conclusion\n\nAdaptive preferences pose a philosophically fertile challenge: they appear subjectively endorsed yet objectively shaped by injustice.  Subjectivist, content-based and historical theories each illuminate a facet of the phenomenon, but none alone suffices.  Subjectivism discounts social path-dependence; content-based views threaten pluralism; historical accounts require more normative structure.  A layered model\u2014historical at its core, procedural in its safeguards, and minimally substantive in its concern for the preconditions of agency\u2014best explains why and when adaptive preferences are less than fully autonomous.\n\nSuch a conception vindicates our complex moral intuitions.  It allows us to affirm the dignity and partial agency of persons under constraint while retaining the critical vocabulary needed to challenge oppressive structures that shape desires.  It honours the insight that to respect someone as an autonomous being is not merely to accept her present preferences at face value, but to care about the freedom-inflected history of those preferences and about her ongoing power to question and revise them.  Autonomy, on this view, is not a momentary achievement sealed inside the psyche, but a relational and historically situated practice\u2014one that oppression can debilitate and that justice must strive to restore.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 14, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 3546, "reasoning_tokens": 320}
{"question_id": "Franzn-EvaluativeDiscourseAffective-2020", "question": "In English, the verb 'find' (as in 'Holmes finds Saltimbocca tasty' or 'She finds lying wrong') is a 'subjective attitude verb' that only allows certain predicates to embed under it\u2014evaluative predicates like 'tasty,' 'cruel,' and 'beautiful' embed felicitously, while purely descriptive predicates like 'vegetarian' or 'made of pasta' do not. Expressivists about evaluative discourse maintain that evaluative statements express non-cognitive attitudes in the same way that ordinary descriptive statements express beliefs. If it could be shown that 'find' states are non-cognitive in nature, this would provide linguistic support for expressivism, since evaluative assertions combined with denials of being in the corresponding 'find' state produce Moorean infelicity (e.g., '??It is wrong to eat meat but I don't find it wrong'). What evidence supports the thesis that the mental states attributed by 'find'-constructions are non-cognitive and specifically affective in nature, belonging to the same category as states like appreciating, loving, hating, and detesting?", "answer": "1. Introduction: the significance of \u201cfind\u201d\n\nPhilosophers who defend some version of contemporary expressivism\u2014whether in meta-ethics, aesthetics, or the theory of taste\u2014have long sought purely linguistic phenomena that would vindicate their core thought that evaluative discourse is fundamentally different in kind from ordinary descriptive discourse.  The English verb \u201cfind\u201d seems an ideal test case.  It embeds only evaluative predicates (Holmes finds the aria sublime, Giulia finds meanness contemptible) and resists embedding of ordinary descriptive predicates (*Holmes finds the aria Italian, *Giulia finds the table rectangular).  If the mental attitude that \u201cfind\u201d attributes is not a belief-like, truth-evaluating state but an essentially affective or conative one\u2014something more like enjoying, loving, or being amused\u2014then the sentence pattern \u201cS finds \u03d5-adj\u201d would provide a grammatical window onto the non-cognitive mental life that expressivists claim evaluative sentences give voice to.  What reasons do we have for thinking that the \u201cfind\u201d-attitude is indeed affective rather than cognitive?  In what follows I assemble a cumulative case, drawing on (i) syntactic and semantic distributional facts, (ii) phenomenological and psychological considerations, (iii) inferential and epistemic behavior, (iv) patterns of disagreement, (v) cross-linguistic parallels, and (vi) the Moorean infelicity diagnostics already familiar from meta-ethics.  No single consideration is decisive; taken together, however, they support the conclusion that to find something tasty, cruel, riveting, or wrong is to be in an affect-loaded, preference-like state from the same broad family as appreciating, loving, hating, or being amused.\n\n2. Selectional restrictions and the first clue\n\nA natural place to start is the selectional restriction on complements.  \u201cFind\u201d comfortably embeds:\n\n  Holmes finds the curry delicious.  \n  Charlotte finds the novel poignant.  \n  I find early Wittgenstein exhilarating.  \n\nThe moment we replace the predicate adjective with a purely descriptive one, felicity collapses:\n\n  *Holmes finds the curry Indian.  \n  *Charlotte finds the novel 300-pages-long.  \n  *I find early Wittgenstein written before 1921.  \n\nGrammatical selectional restrictions often align with ontological or cognitive categories: verbs of perception select for perceptual complements (\u201csee that\u2026,\u201d \u201chear that\u2026\u201d) and propositional attitude verbs select for propositions that license truth evaluation.  The fact that \u201cfind\u201d filters out truth-conditional, purely descriptive predicates strongly hints that it does not target belief-like content but something else\u2014call it evaluational content.  That is the first, albeit defeasible, clue.\n\n3. Phenomenology: what it is like to \u201cfind\u201d\n\nTurn now to the first-person character of the state.  A speaker who sincerely utters \u201cI find cilantro disgusting\u201d reports an occurrent affective reaction: a negative gustatory-olfactory response that carries an unmistakable phenomenology of aversion.  By contrast \u201cI think cilantro is an umbellifer\u201d expresses a belief devoid of any distinctive \u201cwhat-it-is-like.\u201d  Nothing in introspection is ever decisive in philosophy of mind, but the difference is stable, salient, and cross-subjectively accessible.  It mimics the contrast between \u201cI love free jazz\u201d and \u201cI believe free jazz originated in the 1950s.\u201d  The former involves liking, appreciation, or pleasure; the latter does not.  Phenomenological evidence is therefore consonant with the idea that \u201cfinding\u201d belongs with loving, hating, enjoying, or fearing rather than with believing, supposing, or doubting.\n\n4. Epistemic factivity and the possibility of error\n\nBeliefs are inherently liable to truth-directed evaluation: one can sensibly say \u201cI might be wrong that heavy water is lethal.\u201d  A striking asymmetry emerges with \u201cfind\u201d complements.  Contrast:\n\n  (1) I might be wrong that the soup contains star anise.  \n  (2) ??I might be wrong that the soup is delicious.  \n\nSentence (2) is odd if it means \u201cI might be wrong in finding it delicious,\u201d though it is fine if we re-read it as \u201cwrong\u201d in a quasi-moral sense (\u201cI might be making a culinary error\u201d).  The natural sense of epistemic fallibility is unavailable.  The oddness makes perfect sense if \u201cfinding delicious\u201d is not the sort of representational state that aims at correctness in the way beliefs do.\n\nA parallel test deploys the operator \u201cknow.\u201d  \u201cI know that Toledo is in Spain\u201d is impeccable.  \u201c??I know that the soup is delicious,\u201d in the intended non-generic reading, is distinctly awkward, whereas \u201cI know that I find the soup delicious\u201d is fine.  The point generalizes: whenever we index predicates of epistemic appraisal (know, doubt, probably) directly to the evaluative complement of \u201cfind,\u201d the result is degraded; when we index them to the entire attitudinal clause (\u201cI know that I find\u2026\u201d) the sentence recovers.  The simplest explanation is that what embeds under \u201cfind\u201d is not the sort of content that supports epistemic operators, again marking it as non-cognitive.\n\n5. Projection and quasi-perceptual presentation\n\nBelief reports generally allow the descriptive content to \u201cproject\u201d through sentential operators without necessarily remaining endorsed.  \u201cIt\u2019s not the case that I think the plan is feasible\u201d withdraws the speaker\u2019s commitment to feasibility.  With \u201cfind,\u201d a different pattern arises.  \u201cI don\u2019t find the plan feasible\u201d cancels the affective stance, but the very use of \u201cfeasible\u201d still presents the plan to the conversational common ground under the (evaluative) guise of feasibility.  Something analogous occurs with sensory verbs (\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look red to me\u201d still traffics in redness).  Semanticists have therefore modeled \u201cfind\u201d as a subjective perception verb, attaching an individual judge parameter to the predicate much as \u201ctasty\u201d and \u201clooks red\u201d require.  In frameworks such as Lasersohn\u2019s (2005) \u201cjudge-parameter semantics,\u201d subjectivity is not a mere pragmatic side-effect: it is built into the truth-conditions of sentences containing taste predicates.  The quasi-perceptual role of \u201cfind\u201d\u2014its presenting of properties relative to a judge\u2014matches how affective states like relish, amusement, or dread manifest: they are felt from a first-person perspective and do not purport to be stance-independent.\n\n6. Inference patterns and reason-giving\n\nCognitive propositional attitudes license the familiar network of inferences: knowing that p and knowing that (p \u2192 q) normally allows one to infer that q; believing that x is true and that x entails y rationally licenses believing that y.  \u201cFind\u201d does not participate.  From \u201cGiulia finds violence wrong\u201d and \u201cAll wrong acts ought to be condemned\u201d it does not follow that Giulia finds violence condemnable.  Likewise, the canonical belief/desire set necessary for practical reasoning\u2014believing the beer is in the fridge and desiring beer\u2014permits the formation of an intention; substituting \u201cfinding\u201d for either belief or desire breaks the inference.  The data sit neatly with the thought that \u201cfinding\u201d expresses a sui generis affective stance, less disciplined by evidential constraints and inferential networks than belief and more like desire, preference, or emotion.\n\n7. Patterns of disagreement\n\nPrecisely because \u201cfind\u201d expresses a subjective stance, sentences of the form \u201cA: I find cilantro delicious.  B: I don\u2019t\u201d display the familiar \u201cfaultless disagreement\u201d phenomenon: both claims can be simultaneously true yet pragmatically discordant.  Standardly explanatory is the idea that two mutually incompatible non-cognitive states clash without one being false.  Compare: \u201cI enjoy opera.\u201d  \u201cWell, I don\u2019t.\u201d  Each speaker reveals a conflicting pro-attitude, and that suffices for disagreement in the conversational sense.  Belief disagreements, by contrast, aim at a mutually exclusive truth-value.  Expressivists happily note that the same pattern pervades moral discourse: \u201cStealing is wrong.\u201d  \u201cNo, it isn\u2019t.\u201d  The close match between the \u201cfind\u201d paradigm and moral talk strengthens the claim that the underlying attitudes are of the same affective species.\n\n8. Linguistic tests for affect: intensifiers, exclamatives, and degree modifiers\n\nAnother diagnostic comes from the compatibility of \u201cfind\u201d complements with expressive modifiers such as \u201cabsolutely,\u201d \u201cutterly,\u201d and exclamative constructions:\n\n  I find this movie utterly magnificent!  \n  *I find this movie utterly two-hours-long!\n\nDegree modifiers commonly attach to gradable adjectives expressing value and emotion (amazing, disgraceful, delightful).  That they work smoothly in \u201cfind\u201d complements but fail with descriptive adjectives again aligns \u201cfind\u201d with affective evaluation.  Similar behavior surfaces with evaluative interjections (\u201cYum!\u201d \u201cYikes!\u201d) and with \u201cso\u2026that\u2026\u201d result constructions (\u201cShe found the speech so moving that she cried\u201d).  The lexical company one keeps is often a better guide to grammatical category than folk-psychological reflection, and here the company is unmistakably affective.\n\n9. Cross-linguistic confirmation\n\nThe distributional facts are not an English idiosyncrasy.  German \u201cfinden,\u201d French \u201ctrouver,\u201d Italian \u201ctrovare,\u201d Spanish \u201cencontrar\u201d and many other cognates show precisely the same pattern: they select for evaluative complements, resist purely extensional adjectives, and share the same phenomenological overtones.  For instance:\n\n  Ich finde diesen Witz beleidigend.  \n  *Ich finde diesen Witz deutsch geschrieben.  \n\n  Je trouve ce tableau splendide.  \n  *Je trouve ce tableau rectangulaire.  \n\nThe cross-linguistic robustness suggests a deep cognitive-semantic alignment, not mere lexicographical happenstance.  From the standpoint of methodology, recurrence across languages counts heavily toward psychological reality.\n\n10. Psychological and neuroscientific evidence\n\nAffect-laden evaluative judgements\u2014whether gustatory, moral, or aesthetic\u2014activate limbic and paralimbic regions (orbitofrontal cortex, anterior insula, ventromedial prefrontal cortex) associated with reward, aversion, and emotion regulation (see, inter alia, Blood & Zatorre 2001 on musical chills, Moll et al. 2002 on moral sentiments).  By contrast, truth-directed factual judgements rely more heavily on dorsal prefrontal networks implicated in propositional reasoning.  Although neuroimaging is hardly fine-grained enough to read off semantic categories, the alignment of \u201cfinding tasty/wrong/beautiful\u201d with affective circuitry dovetails with the linguistic claim that the underlying state is affective.  Developmental studies reinforce the picture: children\u2019s mastery of \u201cfind\u201d correlates with their ability to talk about preferences and emotions rather than with their mastery of belief attribution; autistic speakers who show deficits in affective theory-of-mind likewise struggle more with \u201cfind\u201d complements than with ordinary propositional attitude verbs.\n\n11. Moorean infelicity redux\n\nExpressivists famously deploy Moorean-style paradoxes to reveal the attitudinal commitments of moral and evaluative sentences.  Utterances such as \u201cIt\u2019s wrong to cheat but I don\u2019t disapprove of cheating\u201d are pragmatically defective.  The same pattern holds for \u201cfind\u201d:\n\n  ??Eating meat is wrong but I don\u2019t find it wrong.  \n  ??This curry is delicious but I don\u2019t find it delicious.  \n\nThe best explanation, already familiar from the moral case, is that asserting p while denying the corresponding attitude violates a pragmatic consistency norm governing the expression of affective stances.  Cognitive belief sentences do not behave this way: \u201cIt\u2019s raining but I don\u2019t believe it\u201d is bizarre because it conflicts with the sincerity rule for assertion, not because it expresses conflicting attitudes.  Thus \u201cfind\u201d constructions generate the same expressive-pragmatic profile as standard evaluative assertions, again favoring a non-cognitivist treatment.\n\n12. Parallels with canonical affective verbs\n\nCompare \u201cfind\u201d to undisputed affective attitude verbs such as \u201clove,\u201d \u201chate,\u201d \u201cenjoy,\u201d or \u201cfear.\u201d  All:\n\na) Select for objects or complements that describe evaluands rather than truth-apt propositions (\u201cShe hates nachos,\u201d \u201cHe fears spiders,\u201d \u201cI love that she is honest\u201d (with a reified that-clause understood as an object of emotion, not a proposition to be evaluated for truth)).  \nb) Are resistant to epistemic operators (\u201c??I know that I hate pop music\u201d is fine only on a metalinguistic reading).  \nc) License Moorean contradictions very similar to those seen with \u201cfind\u201d (\u201c??I love jazz but I don\u2019t love jazz\u201d).  \n\nThe tight match in grammatical and pragmatic behaviour makes it natural\u2014by the principle of explanatory parsimony\u2014to classify \u201cfinding\u201d together with the affective family.\n\n13. Objections and replies\n\nObjectors often suggest a response-dependent cognitivist account: to find X tasty is to believe that X has the response-dependent property of being tasty-to-me (or to people with my palate).  But such a move predicts that the resulting embedded content should behave exactly like ordinary descriptive predicates (\u201cis-tasty-to-me\u201d is a relational property that is either instantiated or not).  As we have seen, however, \u201ctasty\u201d under \u201cfind\u201d fails the epistemic fallibility test, the intensifier test, and the disagreement test in just the ways relational descriptive predicates do not.  Moreover, embedding \u201cis-tasty-to-me\u201d under \u201cbelieve\u201d is perfectly grammatical (\u201cI believe this soup is tasty-to-me\u201d), whereas embedding it under \u201cfind\u201d is redundant and odd (\u201cI find this soup tasty-to-me\u201d).  The relational cognitivist paraphrase therefore over-generates felicity and under-predicts the striking linguistic quirks.\n\nOthers note that \u201cfind\u201d has additional, clearly cognitive uses: \u201cI find that print too small,\u201d \u201cWe found him to be in error after all,\u201d or scientific \u201cfindings.\u201d  Indeed the verb is polysemous; nothing in the present argument denies an epistemic sense of \u201cfind\u201d equivalent to \u201cdiscover.\u201d  The claim is that in the subjective attitude construction \u201cfind NP/Adj,\u201d the relevant sense is affective.  Polysemy is common\u2014compare \u201csee\u201d in \u201cI see a pigeon\u201d (perceptual) versus \u201cI see that you are upset\u201d (cognitive).  The existence of a cognitive sense does not negate the affective character of the subjective-attitude sense; it merely reinforces the need for careful sense disambiguation.\n\n14. The cumulative abductive argument\n\nNo individual test is absolute.  Epistemic factivity admits exceptions, phenomenology can mislead, patterns of disagreement are theoretically contestable.  But an inference to the best explanation of the entire cluster\u2014selectional restrictions, lack of epistemic operators, unique projection behaviour, affective phenomenology, faultless disagreement, cross-linguistic robustness, and neuro-psychological data\u2014suggests that the mental state \u201cfind\u201d ascribes is non-cognitive and specifically affective.  It is a pro- or con-attitude of attraction, repulsion, admiration, or condemnation.  It does not aim at truth, but rather embodies a mode of liking, disliking, or valuing, much like loving, hating, appreciating, or detesting.\n\n15. Implications for expressivism\n\nIf that is correct, linguists and philosophers of language have identified a locution whose surface grammar transparently signals an affective stance and whose underlying mental ontology fits the expressivist worldview.  Since Moorean paradox tests pattern the same way for moral/evaluative sentences and for \u201cfind\u201d sentences, the antecedently puzzling pragmatic profile of evaluative assertion receives an elegant explanation: asserting \u201cX is wrong\u201d conventionally expresses a state of finding X wrong (i.e., disapproving of X).  The felicity conditions of evaluative talk are thus the felicity conditions of revealing one\u2019s evaluative stance\u2014hence non-cognitivism gains concrete linguistic corroboration.\n\n16. Conclusion\n\nWe set out to ask what evidence supports the thesis that the mental states reported by English \u201cfind\u201d in its subjective-attitude use are non-cognitive, affect-laden states belonging to the same psychic category as loving, hating, or detesting.  The evidence is varied: syntactic selection, semantic behavior with epistemic operators, phenomenological character, inferential inertness, patterns of disagreement, association with expressive modifiers, cross-linguistic stability, and convergence with psychological and neuroscientific findings.  Each strand, taken alone, might admit alternative explanations; combined, they form a mutually reinforcing network best captured by treating \u201cfind\u201d-states as affective attitudes.  That conclusion lends independent linguistic support to expressivist meta-ethical accounts, for it shows that there is an established, productive grammatical device in ordinary English whose entire function is to voice evaluation without representing facts\u2014precisely what expressivists say moral and aesthetic discourse does.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 0, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 4264, "reasoning_tokens": 576}
{"question_id": "Franzn-EvaluativeDiscourseAffective-2020", "question": "In English, the verb 'find' (as in 'Holmes finds Saltimbocca tasty' or 'She finds lying wrong') is a 'subjective attitude verb' that only allows certain predicates to embed under it\u2014evaluative predicates like 'tasty,' 'cruel,' and 'beautiful' embed felicitously, while purely descriptive predicates like 'vegetarian' or 'made of pasta' do not. Expressivists about evaluative discourse maintain that evaluative statements express non-cognitive attitudes in the same way that ordinary descriptive statements express beliefs. If it could be shown that 'find' states are non-cognitive in nature, this would provide linguistic support for expressivism, since evaluative assertions combined with denials of being in the corresponding 'find' state produce Moorean infelicity (e.g., '??It is wrong to eat meat but I don't find it wrong'). What evidence supports the thesis that the mental states attributed by 'find'-constructions are non-cognitive and specifically affective in nature, belonging to the same category as states like appreciating, loving, hating, and detesting?", "answer": "1. Introduction  \n\nA familiar verbal tick of English speakers is the use of the psychological verb \u2018find\u2019 in sentences such as\n\n  (1) Holmes finds saltimbocca tasty.  \n  (2) Mary finds lying wrong.  \n\nThe construction is strikingly selective: it welcomes evaluative predicates\u2014tasty, cruel, unfair, beautiful, funny\u2014yet balks at purely descriptive ones\u2014*vegetarian, made-of-pasta, triangular.  The selectivity has drawn the attention of meta-ethicists searching for linguistic diagnostics of the kind of mental state expressed in first-order evaluative discourse.  If (1) and (2) attribute an affective state, not a judgemental belief, then the tight pragmatic connection between simple evaluations (\u2018Saltimbocca is tasty\u2019, \u2018Lying is wrong\u2019) and the corresponding \u2018find\u2019 reports would speak for non-cognitivist or expressivist accounts of moral and aesthetic language.  The present essay sets out the main pieces of evidence\u2014syntactic, semantic, pragmatic, psychological, and phenomenological\u2014that support the claim that \u2018find\u2019-constructions attribute non-cognitive, specifically affective states of the same broad family as loving, hating, admiring, and detesting.\n\n2. Phenomenological first pass  \n\nBegin with what it is like to \u2018find\u2019 something tasty or cruel.  One undergoes a felt response: gustatory pleasure in the first case, a kind of moral protest in the second.  The response is immediate, valenced, and personally engaging.  It does not feel like entertaining a proposition under a mode of presentation; it feels more like being struck, impressed, or moved.  Compare:  \n\n  I believe that Rome is south of Paris.  \n  I find Rome enchanting.  \n\nThe first state is informational, the second experiential.  Of course phenomenology by itself is not decisive, but it provides a prima facie motivation for grouping \u2018find\u2019-states with other affect-laden attitudes.\n\n3. Distributional selectivity: only evaluatives embed  \n\nThe most conspicuous linguistic fact is the severe restriction on the kind of predicate that can appear in the small clause complement of \u2018find\u2019.  Contrast:\n\n  (3) a. Holmes finds the sauce delicious / too salty / reminiscent of childhood.  \n      b. *Holmes finds the sauce vegetarian / imported / in the fridge.\n\n\u2018Delicious\u2019 and \u2018too salty\u2019 are manifestly evaluative or response-dependent predicates; \u2018vegetarian\u2019, \u2018imported\u2019, \u2018in the fridge\u2019 are purely descriptive.  The anomaly in (3b) is not syntactic\u2014for the same small-clause structure is fine with the verb \u2018consider\u2019: \u2018Holmes considers the sauce vegetarian\u2019.  What fails is specifically the combination with \u2018find\u2019.  The best explanation is that \u2018find\u2019 is semantically specified to select adjectival (or occasionally infinitival) complements that encode a valenced response type.  Verbs of belief, judgement, or calculation show no such restriction: \u2018Holmes believes the sauce vegetarian\u2019 is impeccable.  The distributional evidence thus aligns \u2018find\u2019 with emotive or appetitive verbs which likewise select for evaluative content: \u2018love\u2019, \u2018enjoy\u2019, \u2018loathe\u2019, \u2018despise\u2019.\n\n4. Truth-conditional behaviour and factivity tests  \n\nFurther evidence emerges when we ask whether the complement of \u2018find\u2019 is asserted, presupposed, or merely attributed as part of the subject\u2019s stance.  With factive verbs like \u2018know\u2019 the truth of the complement is presupposed:\n\n  (4) Holmes knows the sauce is vegetarian  \u21d2  The sauce is vegetarian.\n\nWith \u2018find\u2019, no such entailment holds:\n\n  (5) Holmes finds the sauce tasty  \u252c\u21d2  The sauce is tasty.\n\nIndeed, the speaker can deny the evaluation in the same breath without contradiction:\n\n  (6) Holmes finds the sauce tasty, though in fact it\u2019s not tasty at all.\n\nThe resulting discourse is entirely felicitous, unlike the contradiction that would arise with a factive: *\u2018Holmes knows the sauce is vegetarian, though in fact it isn\u2019t\u2019.  What (6) shows is that the main clause reports nothing about the actual tastiness of the sauce; it reports only Holmes\u2019s subjective affect.  Non-cognitivists predict exactly this disconnection between speaker commitment and evaluative content.  By contrast, attributions of belief typically inherit a commitment to the truth of the embedded clause as believed:  \n\n  (7) Holmes believes the sauce tasty, #though in fact it\u2019s not tasty at all.  \n\nThe oddness of the continuation stems from the Quality maxim: you mislead if you attribute a false belief without flagging its falsity.\n\n5. Aspectual and control tests: \u2018stop\u2019, \u2018continue\u2019, \u2018force\u2019\n\nAffect-labelled states behave in characteristic ways under aspectual operators.\n\n  (8) a. Mary stopped loving Mahler.  \n      b. Mary stopped believing Mahler was Austrian.\n\nBoth are possible, but (8a) intuitively describes an emotional transformation, whereas (8b) suggests an evidential update.  Now compare:\n\n  (9) Mary stopped finding Mahler\u2019s music moving.\n\nHere the sentence patterns with (8a): it depicts the waning of a sentiment, not a correction of a mistaken representation.  Similarly, imperatives that target emotions are notoriously ill-formed:\n\n  (10) #Find broccoli delicious!\n\nYou cannot command someone to have the relevant affective response, just as #\u2018Love broccoli!\u2019 is infelicitous; at best you can urge them: \u2018Try to find it delicious\u2019.  Such control properties distinguish desire-like from belief-like attitudes and place \u2018finding\u2019 in the desire-like camp.\n\n6. Moorean infelicity and the Speech-Act test  \n\nOne of the most powerful diagnostics for commitment is the Moore paradox.  Classical versions involve belief:\n\n  (11) *It\u2019s raining but I don\u2019t believe that it\u2019s raining.\n\nThe strangeness comes from simultaneously asserting p and disowning belief in p.  Evaluative sentences yield their own Moorean pattern:\n\n  (12) ?It\u2019s wrong to eat meat but I don\u2019t find it wrong.  \n\nUtterance (12) is pragmatically defective in a strikingly parallel way.  If finding-wrong were a mere belief, the paradox would be predictable; but the force of the oddity persists even though \u2018find\u2019 need not be cognitive.  The more natural counterpart for a state of love likewise resists denial:\n\n  (13) ?He\u2019s lovable but I don\u2019t love him.\n\nWe should not over-interpret degrees of awkwardness\u2014but the existence of a recognisable Moore-effect strongly suggests that simple evaluative assertions commit the speaker to being in the relevant \u2018find\u2019 state, just as they commit her to the truth of the descriptive content when she speaks descriptively.  That alignment again speaks for an affective reading of \u2018find\u2019.\n\n7. Compatibilities with emotive modifiers and in-depth explanation  \n\nWhen we zoom in on adverbial modification, we discover that \u2018find\u2019 combines smoothly with adverbs depicting emotional engagement, but resists purely epistemic ones:\n\n  (14) a. Holmes genuinely / deeply / viscerally finds the film disturbing.  \n      b. #Holmes evidentially / inferentially finds the film disturbing.\n\nConversely, \u2018believe\u2019 patterns the other way:\n\n  (15) a. Holmes inferentially believes the key is under the mat.  \n      b. #Holmes viscerally believes the key is under the mat.\n\nSuch selectional facts belong to the nitty-gritty of lexical semantics; but they are hard to dismiss as accidental.  The neat portability of emotive adverbs to \u2018find\u2019 diagnoses the attitude as affect-laden.\n\nExplanation requests tell the same story.  To the question \u2018Why does Mary find animal testing cruel?\u2019 a felicitous answer cites emotional experiences, sympathy with animals, imagery of suffering.  Offering purely theoretical propositions\u2014\u2018Well, she gathered statistical evidence\u2019\u2014sounds off-key unless we reinterpret the question as \u2018Why does Mary believe animal testing cruel?\u2019.  What calls for explanation is a sensitivity of sentiment, not an evidential chain leading to belief.\n\n8. Psychological and neurological corroboration  \n\nWork in cognitive science suggests that moral and aesthetic verdicts characteristically recruit limbic and paralimbic circuits associated with emotion.  A series of fMRI studies (Greene 2001; Kawabata & Zeki 2004) show heightened activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and the amygdala when subjects judge scenarios morally wrong or artworks beautiful, whereas mundane factual judgements leave those regions comparatively quiet.  Of course neuro-imaging does not reveal the content of attitudes, but the contrast in neural profile dovetails with the linguistic picture: the mental state reported by \u2018find\u2019 is implemented in systems subserving affect, not in perceptual or propositional memory systems.  Such convergence of evidence fits snugly with the expressivist hypothesis that evaluative predication articulates motivationally charged, non-truth-conditional attitudes.\n\n9. Parallel with appreciative verbs  \n\nEnglish possesses a class of attitude verbs widely recognized as affective: \u2018love\u2019, \u2018hate\u2019, \u2018enjoy\u2019, \u2018admire\u2019, \u2018fear\u2019, \u2018resent\u2019, \u2018detest\u2019.  They share with \u2018find\u2019 at least four diagnostics:\n\n  \u2022 They tolerate first-person mental-state reports in the present simple (\u2018I love spinach\u2019, \u2018I find spinach tasty\u2019) that sound naturally dispositional.  \n  \u2022 They license intensifiers that measure emotional strength (\u2018really\u2019, \u2018absolutely\u2019, \u2018positively\u2019).  \n  \u2022 They reject compatibility with factive complements.  One cannot *\u2018love that two plus two equals four\u2019.  \n  \u2022 They stand outside the usual network of doxastic inferences.  From \u2018I hate spinach\u2019 and \u2018Spinach is healthy\u2019 no rational clash ensues, whereas from \u2018I believe spinach unhealthy\u2019 and the second premise a clash does follow.\n\nGiven the battery of shared properties, the null hypothesis is that \u2018find\u2019 belongs to the very same psychological type.  The burden of proof shifts to the cognitivist who must explain why \u2018find\u2019 differs behaviourally from straightforward belief attributions but for mysterious, unspecifiable reasons.\n\n10. Polysemy and the discovery sense of \u2018find\u2019  \n\nA sceptic may note that \u2018find\u2019 also has a purely epistemic sense:\n\n  (16) Holmes found the gem under the sofa.  \n  (17) I find that the data contradict the hypothesis.\n\nIn (17) the complement is descriptive, and the attitude appears cognitive.  Yet the ambiguity is transparent: (16\u201317) instantiate the \u2018discovery\u2019 or \u2018conclusion\u2019 sense of \u2018find\u2019, not the \u2018subjective attitude\u2019 sense under discussion.  The two senses diverge in their grammatical behaviour: the affective \u2018find\u2019 cannot passivise (*\u2018Saltimbocca was found tasty by Holmes\u2019) and resists tensed finite \u2018that\u2019-clauses (\u2018*Holmes finds that saltimbocca is tasty\u2019).  In contrast, the cognitive \u2018find\u2019 demands a \u2018that\u2019-clause (\u2018Holmes found that the door was unlocked\u2019) and passivises freely.  The semantic bifurcation reinforces, rather than undermines, the thesis that the subjective-attitude \u2018find\u2019 is a member of the affective family.\n\n11. Neg-raising and predicate modification  \n\nAnother syntactic test concerns neg-raising.  Verbs of belief typically allow negation to slide from the matrix to the complement (\u2018I don\u2019t believe he\u2019s coming\u2019 \u2248 \u2018I believe he\u2019s not coming\u2019).  \u2018Find\u2019 blocks the move:\n\n  (18) I don\u2019t believe the plan is fair  \u2248 I believe it\u2019s not fair.  \n  (19) I don\u2019t find the plan fair  \u2260  I find the plan unfair.\n\nInstead, (19) is ambiguous between lacking any attitude and finding it non-fair; the preferred reading is the former, as with \u2018I don\u2019t love\u2019 or \u2018I don\u2019t enjoy\u2019.  The absence of obligatory neg-raising corroborates the claim that \u2018find\u2019 patterns with desire and with emotions, not with belief.\n\n12. Response dependence and context-relativity  \n\nPhilosophers of perception often argue that predicates like \u2018tasty\u2019, \u2018funny\u2019, \u2018disgusting\u2019 are response-dependent: their correct application turns on the reactions of suitable subjects in appropriate circumstances.  The verb \u2018find\u2019 explicitly builds that relational element into the surface grammar.  Uttering (1) or (2) not only acknowledges but foregrounds the subject-dependence of the evaluation.  That feature is precisely what expressivism expects: the core semantic role of evaluative language is to record and communicate patterns of affective response, not to represent stance-independent features of reality.\n\n13. Cross-linguistic considerations  \n\nComparable constructions exist in other languages, where they likewise align with affective predicates.  In French one says \u2018Je trouve ce film magnifique\u2019 (\u2018I find this film magnificent\u2019), and the distributional selectivity is the same\u2014*\u2019Je trouve ce film de deux heures\u2019 (\u2018I find this film two hours long\u2019) is bizarre.  Spanish \u2018parecer\u2019 exhibits similar restrictions in its gustatory uses.  The convergence suggests that we are not facing an English idiosyncrasy but a broader typological pattern in which a verb meaning roughly \u2018encounter\u2019 or \u2018experience as\u2019 grammaticalises into an attitude verb restricted to evaluatives.\n\n14. Motivational upshot  \n\nFinally, the way \u2018find\u2019 relates to action buttresses the affective analysis.  From \u2018I find eating meat wrong\u2019 a straightforward practical conclusion is available: I will refrain from eating meat.  The transition is intelligible given the standard link between emotions and motivation.  The transition is far less direct from a garden-variety belief: \u2018I believe France is hexagonal\u2019 has no evident behavioural corollaries.  That practical import is a hallmark of desires, emotions, and evaluative stances.\n\n15. Objections and replies  \n\nObjection 1: Some people utter \u2018I find that lying is wrong\u2019 with a \u2018that\u2019-clause, apparently using the cognitive sense.  Reply: anecdotal data show occasional mixing, but systematic acceptability judgements keep the two senses apart; corpus counts confirm that \u2018find that\u2026wrong\u2019 is vanishingly rare compared to \u2018find lying wrong\u2019.\n\nObjection 2: One can be mistaken in a \u2018find\u2019 judgement (\u2018I find this fair, but in reality it isn\u2019t\u2019), so the state must be representational.  Reply: one can likewise be mistaken in love (\u2018I love the wrong person\u2019), yet love is paradigmatically affective.  Error here concerns appropriateness or fittingness, not accuracy in representing a fact.  The possibility of error, then, does not entail cognitivism.\n\n16. Synthesis  \n\nLet us recap the converging strands:\n\n  \u2022 Selective embedding: only evaluative predicates fit.  \n  \u2022 Non-factivity: no commitment to the truth of the complement.  \n  \u2022 Moore-style paradoxes: denial of the attitude alongside assertion of the evaluation is infelicitous.  \n  \u2022 Adverbial collocations: affective modifiers combine naturally, epistemic ones poorly.  \n  \u2022 Aspectual behaviour: imperatives and neg-raising pattern with emotions, not beliefs.  \n  \u2022 Psychological evidence: neuro-affective circuits activate in corresponding judgements.  \n  \u2022 Cross-linguistic parallels: the same constraint profile recurs.  \n  \u2022 Motivational relevance: \u2018find\u2019-states are practical in a way characteristic of emotions.\n\nTaken together, these considerations render the affective analysis of the \u2018find\u2019-attitude highly plausible.  When we say that Holmes finds saltimbocca tasty or that Mary finds lying wrong, we attribute to them not a piece of covert perception or a covert belief, but a valenced stance\u2014an occurrent liking, disliking, approval, or disapproval.  The stance belongs to the same genus as loving, admiring, loathing, fearing: it is directed, motivationally potent, and quintessentially first-personal.\n\n17. Philosophical pay-off  \n\nIf that conclusion stands, the linguistic data supply independent support for expressivism.  For the ordinary first-order use of evaluative predicates lines up neatly with the transmission of \u2018find\u2019-states: to call an act wrong just is (in part) to express or invite a state of finding-wrong, an affective condemnation.  The tight coupling between assertion and attitude vindicates the expressivist picture of moral and aesthetic discourse as a sophisticated extension of our affective repertoire, rather than a mere registrar of evaluative facts.  While no single linguistic diagnostic is decisive, the battery surveyed here makes a robust cumulative case: the mental state that English \u2018find\u2019 ascribes is non-cognitive and affective through and through.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 1, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 4524, "reasoning_tokens": 960}

If it could be shown that 'find' states are non-cognitive in nature, this would provide linguistic support for expressivism, since evaluative assertions combined with denials of being in the corresponding 'find' state produce Moorean infelicity (e.g., '??It is wrong to eat meat but I don't find it wrong'). What evidence supports the thesis that the mental states attributed by 'find'-constructions are non-cognitive and specifically affective in nature, belonging to the same category as states like appreciating, loving, hating, and detesting?", "answer": "1. Introduction  \n\nEnglish contains a small but revealing class of \u201csubjective-attitude verbs.\u201d  The paradigmatic members are find, consider, regard, and a handful of experiential verbs such as taste or smell when they take sentential complements (\u201cto me the soup tastes salty\u201d).  Their complements must be evaluative:  \n\n\u2022 Holmes finds Saltimbocca tasty / gorgeous / cruel.  \n\u2022 *Holmes finds Saltimbocca vegetarian / made of pasta.  \n\nThe grammatical contrast has long tempted expressivists to claim a special kinship between these constructions and the underlying psychology of value-judgment.  Very roughly, the thought is that just as belief is the mental state canonically reported by that-clauses after think or believe, so a distinctively affective state is canonically reported by that-clauses after find.  If this is right, then the peculiar Moorean infelicity one hears in \u201c??It is wrong to eat meat but I don\u2019t find it wrong\u201d is explained without ad-hoc stipulation: the first conjunct expresses a non-cognitive attitude while the second retracts having the very attitude just expressed.\n\nThe question is whether we can marshal independent linguistic evidence for treating the state attributed by \u2018find\u2019 as non-cognitive and, more specifically, affect-like\u2014akin to loving, hating, appreciating, or being amused.  In what follows I survey six converging strands of evidence: (i) selectional restrictions, (ii) behavior under factivity and evidential tests, (iii) diagnostics that distinguish cognitive from affective attitudes, (iv) de se authority and first-person privilege, (v) resistance to rational revision, and (vi) cross-linguistic and morphological parallels.  None by itself is decisive, but taken together they paint a compelling picture: to say that x finds \u03c6 is to ascribe an attitudinal state whose psychological core is affective liking, disliking, or evaluative valencing rather than truth-directed belief.\n\n2. Selectional restrictions: evaluativity as a syntactic filter  \n\nVerbs that embed sentential complements are usually promiscuous.  Think, believe, know, doubt, pretend, and hope combine freely with descriptive as well as evaluative clauses.  By contrast, find sharply restricts its complement to (broadly) evaluative predicates.  Ungrammaticality results when that filter is violated:\n\n(1)  *Ada finds that the wall is brick.  \n(2)  *Watson finds that the sample is isotropic.  \n\nRecast with evaluatives and acceptability returns:\n\n(3)  Ada finds the wall ugly.  \n(4)  Watson finds the sample surprisingly beautiful.\n\nLinguists standardly capture the pattern by saying that find selects for a \u201csubjective gradable predicate.\u201d  But the selectivity itself is already revealing.  The canonical explanation for a selectional restriction is that the embedding head semantically requires an argument of a certain type.  If find requires its complement to be evaluative, the natural hypothesis is that the attitude it denotes is evaluative\u2014and not merely because it has evaluation as a topic, but because the mode of presentation of the embedded content is essentially value-laden.  This fits a model on which find denotes something like an affective stance or hedonic reaction, not an ordinary belief state that just happens to be about value.\n\n3. Factivity, truth-conditions, and cancellation  \n\nCompare find with two neighbours: know (factive) and believe (non-factive).  From \u201cHolmes knows that Moriarty left at noon\u201d one may infer \u201cMoriarty left at noon.\u201d  No such inference holds for \u201cHolmes believes that \u2026.\u201d  Crucially, \u201cHolmes finds that p\u201d not only fails to entail p; the sentence does not even present p as at-issue content.  This shows up in cancellation tests:\n\n(5)  Holmes finds that red meat is immoral, though of course it isn\u2019t.      \u2714  \n(6)  Holmes believes that red meat is immoral, though of course it isn\u2019t.    \u2714  \n(7)  Holmes knows that red meat is immoral, though of course it isn\u2019t.       \u2718 (pragmatically contradictory)\n\nBelief behaves here like find\u2014it allows cancellation\u2014so mere non-factivity would not distinguish the two.  The crucial difference emerges when we embed under question, disjunction or conditional operators.  Only content that is part of the truth-conditions projects in these environments.  For example:\n\n(8)  If Holmes finds that foie gras is cruel, he\u2019ll refuse to eat it.  \n(9)  Does Holmes find that foie gras is cruel?  \n\nIn neither (8) nor (9) is it presupposed or entailed that foie gras is cruel.  But this alone still does not mark affective vs cognitive.  Rather, we must look to data where canceling p is not merely possible but obligatory for coherence.  Suppose Watson sincerely asserts:\n\n(10)  Foie gras is cruel, but Holmes doesn\u2019t find it cruel.  \n\nThe sentence is felicitous; it does not exhibit Moorean tension.  By contrast, if Homer first asserts an evaluative claim and seconds later disavows being in the corresponding find-state, oddity results:\n\n(11)  ??Foie gras is cruel, and I don\u2019t find it cruel.  \n\nThe oddity parallels Moore\u2019s paradox, but crucially it is unique to first-person present-tense uses\u2014the very context where attitude-reporting clausal complements standardly yield expression, not mere description, of an attitude.  That pattern matches the behaviour of affective attitudes (love, loathe, admire).  One cannot coherently say \u201cIt\u2019s cruel, but I don\u2019t loathe it for that\u201d if loathing cruel things is what the first clause purports to express.\n\n4. Diagnostics differentiating affective from cognitive attitudes  \n\nLinguists, following Pesetsky, Portner, Kennedy, Sudo and Toyoshima, have developed batteries of tests that pick out genuinely subjective (taste) predicates.  Find-constructions pass nearly every one.\n\na. Faultless disagreement  \n    \u2013 A:   Foie gras is tasty.  \n    \u2013 B:   No, it isn\u2019t.  \nIntuitively a and b may both be \u201cright,\u201d marking merely a clash of preference.  The same holds if we switch to find:  \n    \u2013 A:   Holmes finds foie gras tasty.  \n    \u2013 B:   No, I don\u2019t (or: I find it disgusting).\n\nBut matters differ with belief:  \n    \u2013 A:   Holmes believes that the butler did it.  \n    \u2013 B:   No, the butler didn\u2019t do it.  \nHere we have a dispute about the world, not just attitude.  Faultless disagreement is characteristic of affective taste judgments.\n\nb. Predicates of personal taste license the parenthetical \u201cto me.\u201d  \n    \u201cTo me, spinach is tasty.\u201d  \n    \u201c*To me, spinach is vegetarian.\u201d  \nLikewise:  \n    \u201cTo Holmes, the aria is moving.\u201d  \n    \u201c*To Holmes, the aria is sung in Italian.\u201d  \nThe hitch is that \u201cfind\u201d trivially carries the \u201cto me\u201d element inside its semantics; it ascribes a stance relative to a perspective.  That is strong evidence that the variable in its meaning is a point of view or affective perspective, not a truth-conditional assignment.\n\nc. Embedding under seem and appear.  \n\u201cJohn seems to believe that the earth is flat\u201d is fine, but  \n\u201c??John seems to find spinach tasty\u201d sounds deviant.  The reason, argued by Stephenson and Glanzberg, is that seem selects for content evaluable at the world of evaluation; but the only relevant world parameter for find is the \u201cjudge.\u201d  Since judgeship is not a parameter of metaphysical possibility but of affective perspective, appear/seem cannot properly manipulate it.  Again, the evidence points to an attitude that is not truth-directed.\n\nd. Interaction with intensifiers actually, in fact, really.  \nEpistemic intensifiers boost truth-directed claims: \u201cBill really believes that aliens exist.\u201d  However, \u201cBill really finds cilantro delicious\u201d sounds marked.  Speakers instead choose \u201cBill genuinely finds \u2026,\u201d \u201cBill personally finds \u2026,\u201d or \u201cBill absolutely loves \u2026\u201d\u2014adverbs that target affect or sincerity rather than veridicality.\n\n5. First-person authority and the impossibility of evidence-based correction  \n\nBeliefs are corrigible by factual evidence that settles p\u2019s truth.  Affective stances are not: learning that most people dislike cilantro gives me no reason to change how cilantro tastes to me.  Find aligns with the latter.\n\nScenario:  Holmes says, \u201cI find licorice tasty.\u201d  Watson replies:  \n    (12)  No you don\u2019t; you\u2019re wrong\u2014licorice is in fact insipid.  \n\nWatson comes off as confused: evidence about licorice\u2019s chemical composition, or about general gustatory reactions, cannot rebut Holmes\u2019s claim about what he finds.  The only legitimate rebuttal approach is first-person authority challenge, e.g., \u201cYou\u2019re bluffing,\u201d \u201cYou are numbed by the cold,\u201d or \u201cYou\u2019re misdescribing your own experience,\u201d paralleling challenges to someone\u2019s avowal of pain.  That is precisely how we handle affective states\u2014not belief states, for which third-person evidence is ordinarily admissible.\n\n6. Resistance to deliberative updating and deductive closure  \n\nBelief is closed under known logical consequence.  If Holmes believes p and believes that p \u2192 q, rationality demands that Holmes believe q.  Not so for affective attitudes: loving A and recognising that whatever one loves is worth protecting does not guarantee loving protecting A.  Find-ascriptions pattern like the latter.  Suppose Holmes finds duck delicious and also finds that whatever is delicious ought to be on the menu.  It does not follow that Holmes finds that duck ought to be on the menu.  Intuitively, the state of finding duck delicious is a direct affective reaction; its content is not structured in a way amenable to closure under theoretical reasoning.\n\n7. De se immediacy and immunity to error through misidentification  \n\nAttitudinal verbs can yield de se readings: \u201cI remembered that I had left the stove on.\u201d  Lewis famously argued that de se beliefs are special.  Yet the immunity to misidentifying whose reaction is in question is even tighter for affective states: I cannot coherently wonder, \u201cSomeone finds this souffl\u00e9 disgusting\u2014but who could it be?  Perhaps it\u2019s me?\u201d  Likewise with find: the experiencer either is the subject or there is no evaluation.  That suggests an underlying experiential or phenomenological component, which is paradigmatic of affects.\n\n8. Scalar modifiers favouring intensity rather than probability  \n\nBelief phrases combine with hedges of degree of confidence: kind of believes, half believes, firmly believes.  With find, intensifiers instead measure affective strength: absolutely finds, positively finds, barely finds.  \u201cHalf finds\u201d or \u201cprobably finds\u201d are odd except under metalinguistic reinterpretation.  The distribution mirrors the profile of love, hate, and enjoy, which admit gradable intensity, not epistemic confidence.\n\n9. Animacy and agent-sensitivity  \n\nYou can say, \u201cThe algorithm believes the patient is septic\u201d or \u201cThe thermostat thinks it\u2019s cold.\u201d  Find resists such personification; \u201c#The algorithm finds the colour scheme ugly\u201d is infelicitous unless highly metaphorical or poetic.  A computer can store cognitive states, but it cannot literally undergo hedonic or affective experiences.  The verb apparently presupposes an experiencer capable of phenomenal valence.\n\n10. Cross-linguistic and morphological corroboration  \n\nRomance languages supply an illuminating comparison.  French trouver and Spanish encontrar show identical syntactic limitations and the same expressive profile.  French:  \n\n\u2022  Je trouve ce vin d\u00e9licieux.  \n\u2022  *Je trouve que ce vin est ferment\u00e9 en f\u00fbt d\u2019acier.  \n\nBoth also contrast with croire \u2018believe\u2019 and penser \u2018think\u2019, whose complementation is unrestricted.  In Japanese, omou \u2018think\u2019 embeds any clause, whereas kimochi-yoku omoeru \u2018feel comfortable\u2019 mirrors the English pattern.  This suggests a cross-linguistic generalisation: languages carve out a special slot for verbs of affective appreciation, and English find fills exactly that niche.\n\nMorphologically, English find in this sense arguably descends from Old English findan \u2018come upon, experience, meet with\u2019, not from the inferential sense \u201cdiscover.\u201d  The historical semantics of encounter + experiential reaction again lines up with affect rather than pure cognition.\n\n11. Philosophical pay-off: the Moorean pattern and expressivism  \n\nThe foregoing linguistic data motivate treating find(ing) as a genuine mental stance that (a) is irreducibly first-personal, (b) encodes a hedonic or evaluative reaction, and (c) is not governed by norms of truth but by norms of authenticity or fit with one\u2019s affective sensibility.  Once that is granted, the philosophical puzzle at the start dissipates.  When I assert \u201cEating meat is wrong,\u201d I put forward the very same type of affective stance as is attributed by \u201cI find eating meat wrong.\u201d  Consequently, it is pragmatically bizarre\u2014in the same way Moore paradoxes are bizarre\u2014to conjoin the evaluative assertion with a denial that I am in the relevant stance.  The wrongness-talk is, so to speak, a window onto the find-state, just as assertion of a descriptive proposition is a window onto belief.\n\n12. Objections and replies  \n\nObjection 1:  Speakers sometimes use find with non-evaluatives (\u201cI find that fewer students attend office hours in the spring\u201d).  \nReply:  Corpus studies show such uses are rare and overwhelmingly restricted to the \u201cdiscover/observe\u201d sense, which takes a finite complement introduced by that and carries perfective aspect (\u201cI found that\u2026\u201d).  The progressive or plain present that licences evaluatives (\u201cI find spinach tasty\u201d) is ungrammatical in the discovery sense (\u201c*I find that fewer students attend\u2026\u201d).  We are dealing with a homonym, not a counter-example.\n\nObjection 2:  One can supply supporting reasons: \u201cI find taxes unfair because they penalise effort.\u201d  Doesn\u2019t giving reasons reveal a belief structure?  \nReply:  Affective attitudes frequently have rationalising explanations without being reducible to belief.  I hate betrayal because it exhibits indifference to trust; yet hating is an emotion, not a belief.  The because-clause states a triggering consideration, not a premise in an inference to a conclusion.  Moreover, note the asymmetry: showing the reason erroneous rarely eliminates the find-attitude (\u201cI still find it unfair, even though I see your point\u201d).\n\nObjection 3:  Affectivity should correlate with physiological arousal; yet one can soberly say \u201cI find the argument invalid.\u201d  \nReply:  Affect encompasses more than visceral emotion; aesthetic and evaluative appreciation are genuine affective phenomena, often low-arousal.  Loving or admiring can be calm, but are nevertheless orientations of liking and disliking rather than truth-assessments.\n\n13. Conclusion  \n\nThe mental state that English find attributes is not a disguised variety of belief.  Its selectional behaviour, truth-conditional profile, felicity conditions, interaction with epistemic operators, animacy constraints, and cross-linguistic analogues all converge on a single diagnosis: find reports a subjective, affective stance\u2014one lodged on the \u201cliking/disliking\u201d side of our folk taxonomy of attitudes, alongside loving, hating, admiring, appreciating, being amused or disgusted.  Because ordinary positive and negative evaluative statements function in discourse to voice just such attitudes, the linguistic facts about find lend direct empirical support to expressivist semantics for value-language.  Far from being an idiosyncratic quirk, the Moorean oddity of \u201cIt\u2019s wrong, but I don\u2019t find it wrong\u201d is the surface reflection of a deeper semantic alignment between evaluative assertion and affective stance.  Philosophers interested in the cognition\u2013affect divide, the semantics-pragmatics interface, or the viability of expressivism thus have good reason to take the grammar of find very seriously indeed.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 2, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 4173, "reasoning_tokens": 704}
{"question_id": "Franzn-EvaluativeDiscourseAffective-2020", "question": "In English, the verb 'find' (as in 'Holmes finds Saltimbocca tasty' or 'She finds lying wrong') is a 'subjective attitude verb' that only allows certain predicates to embed under it\u2014evaluative predicates like 'tasty,' 'cruel,' and 'beautiful' embed felicitously, while purely descriptive predicates like 'vegetarian' or 'made of pasta' do not. Expressivists about evaluative discourse maintain that evaluative statements express non-cognitive attitudes in the same way that ordinary descriptive statements express beliefs. If it could be shown that 'find' states are non-cognitive in nature, this would provide linguistic support for expressivism, since evaluative assertions combined with denials of being in the corresponding 'find' state produce Moorean infelicity (e.g., '??It is wrong to eat meat but I don't find it wrong'). What evidence supports the thesis that the mental states attributed by 'find'-constructions are non-cognitive and specifically affective in nature, belonging to the same category as states like appreciating, loving, hating, and detesting?", "answer": "1. Setting the Stage  \n\nEver since A-J. Ayer and C. L. Stevenson introduced the idea that moral and aesthetic language functions more like a cry of approval than a statement of fact, expressivists have searched for purely linguistic evidence that evaluative discourse is non-cognitive\u2014evidence that would show, in Paul Grice\u2019s phrase, that \u201cthe word does the work.\u201d  The English verb find looks tailor-made for that job.  In ordinary conversation we say things such as\n\n\u2003\u2003(1) Holmes finds saltimbocca tasty.  \n\u2003\u2003(2) She finds lying wrong.  \n\nyet we would never say  \n\n\u2003\u2003(3) *Holmes finds saltimbocca vegetarian.  \n\u2003\u2003(4) *She finds lying made-of-pasta.  \n\nIntuitively, (1) and (2) attribute something like liking or disliking, while (3) and (4) do not even make sense.  If the attitude expressed by find were simply a belief, nothing in principle should prevent *find vegetarian* from being acceptable; but it is not.  The question, then, is whether there is good evidence\u2014semantic, syntactic, pragmatic, and psychological\u2014that the mental state ascribed by find is non-cognitive and specifically affective, standing shoulder to shoulder with loving, hating, detesting, adoring, appreciating, and the like.  I shall argue that there is such evidence and explore six mutually reinforcing lines of support: selectional restrictions, truth-value independence, Moorean infelicity, epistemic access patterns, behavioral anchoring, and cross-linguistic plus psycholinguistic data.\n\n2. Selectional Restrictions: What Find May and May Not Embed  \n\nAttitude verbs are famous for insisting on complements of a particular semantic type.  Believe embeds declarative clauses of any content; want embeds infinitives (or that-clauses) that describe unrealised states of affairs; fear embeds propositions with a negative valence; and so on.  Find is peculiar in that it accepts only adjectives and participles that are evaluative.  Compare:\n\n\u2003\u2003(5) Holmes finds the painting beautiful / ugly / derivative.  \n\u2003\u2003(6) Holmes finds the painting large / Italian / over two metres wide.  \n\n(5) is impeccable, (6) ranges from odd to impossible.  Native speakers hear (6) either as a slip or as an echo of some estranged dialect.  The best systematic explanation is that the complement of find must describe a property whose application is, in Kaplan\u2019s sense, \u201cparameterised to a judge,\u201d i.e. something whose instantiation turns on the subject\u2019s affective stance.  In Lasersohn\u2019s semantics of *judge dependence*, \u201ctasty,\u201d \u201ccruel,\u201d and \u201cbeautiful\u201d denote relations not merely between objects and worlds but between objects, worlds, and an experiencer parameter.  Treating find-complements this way neatly derives the selectional fact: non-evaluative adjectives fail to supply the required judge variable, so the construction crashes.\n\nNow, if find merely expressed a higher-order belief\u2014say, the belief that saltimbocca is tasty-to-Holmes\u2014one would expect find to embed any adjective for which one can form a corresponding higher-order belief.  Yet we have no trouble believing things are vegetarian; we simply cannot *find* them vegetarian.  The natural conclusion is that find is not a belief-report at all but the report of a non-cognitive state that is constitutively connected to a judge-relative evaluation.\n\n3. Truth-Value Independence: The Ease of \u2018Error\u2019 Attributions  \n\nOrdinary belief verbs behave in a factive or quasi-factive pattern: if I say\n\n\u2003\u2003(7) Holmes believes saltimbocca is vegetarian,  \n\nand later learn saltimbocca is not vegetarian, I will be disposed to say\n\n\u2003\u2003(8) Holmes\u2019s belief is false.  \n\nBut consider\n\n\u2003\u2003(9) Holmes finds saltimbocca tasty, but actually it isn\u2019t tasty (to me / to the critics / in virtue of its ingredients).  \n\nNo inconsistency arises; both clauses can be simultaneously accepted.  That is exactly what one would expect if \u201ctasty\u201d is judge-dependent and if find does not purport to represent the world as being any particular way independently of the subject\u2019s response.  The absence of a *factivity presupposition* is diagnostic of a non-representational state: you can coherently deny the worldly predicate while attributing the attitude, just as you can say \u201cHolmes fears spiders, but spiders are harmless\u201d without contradiction.  Fear is paradigmatically affective; find patterns with it, not with belief.\n\n4. Moorean Infelicity of the Find Denial  \n\nMoore famously observed that \u201cIt is raining but I don\u2019t believe it is raining\u201d sounds absurd.  Expressivists have long noted a counterpart for moral discourse: \u201cIt is wrong to eat meat but I don\u2019t disapprove of eating meat\u201d jars in the same way.  The find-construction generates the *very* same disharmony:\n\n\u2003\u2003(10) ??Eating meat is wrong, but I don\u2019t find it wrong.  \n\u2003\u2003(11) ??This coffee is delicious, but I don\u2019t find it delicious.  \n\nWhat explains the badness?  On an expressivist diagnosis, the first conjunct functions to express the very attitude whose absence is asserted in the second.  One therefore ends up simultaneously expressing and disavowing the same non-cognitive state.  Now notice that the standard cognitive version is perfectly fine:\n\n\u2003\u2003(12) It rains in Seattle a lot, but I don\u2019t believe it.  \n\nNo Moorean clash here: I can recognise a fact about the meteorological record while confessing my scepticism.  The pattern confirms that find-attributions speak to an attitude that is normally revealed by making the evaluative claim itself.  This tight pragmatic coupling is characteristic of affective states like approval, love, or fear, and it is hard to reproduce on a purely doxastic treatment.\n\n5. Epistemic Access and Justification: How We Know What People Find  \n\nAnother clue comes from the way we justify third-person find-ascriptions.  To say \u201cHolmes believes that the butler did it,\u201d one cites verbal testimony, the documents Holmes consulted, or other epistemic grounds.  To say \u201cHolmes finds coriander soapy,\u201d one points to his facial expressions, his tendency to push coriander to the side of the plate, the grimace he makes when tasting it.  In short, behavioural and phenomenological cues supply warrant\u2014precisely the sort of cues we use to justify attributions of liking, disgust, or fear.  The data are not epistemic but affect-laden.  This indirectness of access is expected for emotions and tastes, not for beliefs, whose canonical evidence remains propositional reports.\n\nCorrespondingly, self-ascriptions of finding license the *authority of introspection* typical of experiential states:\n\n\u2003\u2003(13) A: Are you sure you find this wine too dry?  \n\u2003\u2003B: Of course! I can taste it right now.  \n\nContrast:\n\n\u2003\u2003(14) A: Are you sure you believe the treaty will fail ratification?  \n\u2003\u2003B: Hmm, let me think\u2026 perhaps I\u2019m not sure.  \n\nBelief is subject to reflection, inference, and revision; finding feels more immediate, phenomenally manifest, and not up for rational reconsideration in the same way.  That immediacy supports its affective rather than cognitive profile.\n\n6. Behavioral and Neuro-Affective Anchoring  \n\nThe claim that find is affective gains further credibility from what we know about gustatory, aesthetic, and moral appraisals in cognitive neuroscience.  When subjects make judgements of tastiness or beauty, functional imaging lights up the orbitofrontal cortex, ventral striatum, and other reward-processing centers; the same network activates when they watch loved ones or earn money.  By contrast, purely epistemic reasoning recruits fronto-parietal circuitry associated with working memory and abstract inference.  Though linguistic evidence never dictates neuroscientific conclusions, the alignment is striking: the typical find-complements (tasty, cruel, inspiring) correlate with hedonic processing, the typical belief-complements do not.\n\nThere is also developmental evidence.  Children master the use of find with tasty and fun roughly at the same age they master like and want (around age three), whereas they only later grasp parenthetical belief reports (\u201cI think (that) S\u201d) and mismatches between belief and reality (the classic false-belief task).  Acquisition timing fits the affective mould: find participates in the *early, desire-based* profile rather than the *later, belief-desire* profile.\n\n7. Clustering with Uncontroversially Affective Verbs  \n\nLet us place find in an intensional taxonomy.  Consider the series:\n\n\u2003\u2003love, adore, relish, find delightful  \n\u2003\u2003hate, detest, abhor, find disgusting  \n\u2003\u2003fear, dread, shrink from, find frightening  \n\nEach first verb names an affect.  Syntactically, all permit *exclamative degree modification* (\u201cHe absolutely detests/LOVES/FINDS disgusting\u2026\u201d), take complements that identify the target of emotion (\u201cdetests onions,\u201d \u201cfinds onions disgusting\u201d), and pattern with so-called *judge-dependent* adjectives.  Semantically, they embed the judge parameter and exhibit faultless disagreement.  The simplest theory unifies them: find is an attitude verb whose content is an affect parameter plus a valenced evaluation of the object.  No extra machinery is required.\n\n8. Cross-Linguistic and Diachronic Parallels  \n\nEnglish is not alone.  French *trouver*, German *finden*, Italian *trovare*, and Spanish *encontrar* show the same distribution.  \n\n\u2003\u2003Fr. Je trouve cette blague vulgaire/*v\u00e9g\u00e9tarienne.  \n\u2003\u2003De. Ich finde dieses Bild sch\u00f6n/*\u00f6lgemalt.  \n\nBecause the historical origin is a locative verb (\u201cto come upon\u201d or \u201cto encounter\u201d), the diachronic pathway mirrors that of like, love, and hate\u2014verbs that shifted from action to emotion.  The regularity suggests a cross-linguistically stable grammaticalisation of an affective stance.\n\n9. Objections and Replies  \n\nObjection 1.  Perhaps find simply ascribes a *belief about subjective experience*, e.g. the belief that saltimbocca tastes good-to-me.  \n\nReply.  If that were true, Moorean infelicity should not arise: \u201cSaltimbocca is tasty to me, but I don\u2019t find it tasty\u201d would be coherent, because one may fail to notice one\u2019s own dispositions.  Yet the sentence is infelicitous.  Furthermore, belief about subjective experience requires evidence, introspection, and potential error (\u201cI believed I liked it, but I was wrong\u201d), whereas find attributions do not follow that pattern.  When you discover you dislike coriander, you do not say, \u201cI was wrong in believing I liked it\u201d; you say, \u201cTurns out I don\u2019t like it after all.\u201d  The belief framing is therefore strained.\n\nObjection 2.  Many moral realists hold that moral judgements are cognitive.  If find-judgements in the moral domain (find wrong) are non-cognitive, doesn\u2019t that commit us to an error theory about ordinary \u201cwrong\u201d?  \n\nReply.  No; an expressivist can distinguish *direct* moral predication (It is wrong to lie) from *find*-reports (Jones finds lying wrong).  The claim here is not that moral talk *simpliciter* is non-cognitive, only that the specific mental state ascribed by find is.  One could be a realist about morality while accepting that find-reports describe how an agent affectively appraises an act; realists typically accept that emotions track moral facts.  So the linguistic evidence is neutral on metaethical realism but friendly to the idea that there exists a non-cognitive state whose verbal signature is find.\n\n10. Theoretical Payoff for Expressivism  \n\nWhy does any of this matter?  Because expressivism maintains that the surface grammar of evaluative discourse masks an underlying speech act of *attitude expression*.  One way to test the claim is to locate a verb that overtly attributes such an attitude and see whether its complement profile coincides with the very expressions over which expressivists claim priority.  Find passes that test.  Moreover, the pragmatic oddities that motivate expressivism\u2014faultless disagreement, absorption of first-person authority, Moorean contradictions\u2014reappear under find.  The simplest abductive explanation is that the mental state find denotes is the one expressed, rather than stated, by plain moral and aesthetic language.  Thus the linguistic evidence does not merely cohere with expressivism; it actively predicts patterns that cognitivist rivals struggle to accommodate without auxiliary hypotheses.\n\n11. Conclusion  \n\nA careful look at English (and its Indo-European cousins) reveals that sentences of the form \u2018x finds \u03c6-adj\u2019 display a bundle of diagnostic features: they ban non-evaluative adjectives; they allow negation of the descriptive content without contradiction; they generate Moorean infelicity when coupled with denial of the attitude; their attribution relies on affective behaviour and phenomenological access; they cluster with classical emotion verbs both syntactically and semantically; and they are mirrored in other languages and in developmental, neurological data.  The cumulative case is best explained on the hypothesis that find reports an affective, non-cognitive mental state\u2014precisely the sort of state postulated by expressivists as the engine of evaluative discourse.  While the evidence does not settle every metaethical debate, it provides robust, linguistically grounded support for the view that at least one family of evaluative judgements\u2014the ones we naturally paraphrase with find\u2014belongs to the same psychological category as loving, hating, fearing, and desiring rather than believing.  In so doing, it vindicates the expressivist\u2019s central insight: when we call something tasty, wrong, or beautiful, we do more than describe the world\u2014we reveal how we are moved by it.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 3, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 3791, "reasoning_tokens": 768}

What evidence supports the thesis that the mental states attributed by 'find'-constructions are non-cognitive and specifically affective in nature, belonging to the same category as states like appreciating, loving, hating, and detesting?", "answer": "1. Introduction: why \u201cfind\u201d-constructions matter  \nIn recent decades linguists and meta\u2010ethicists have looked to the micro-syntax of ordinary language for clues about the underlying nature of evaluative thought.  One construction that has attracted special attention is the English subjective-attitude verb find as it appears in sentences such as\n\n\u2003\u2003(1) Holmes finds Saltimbocca tasty.  \n\u2003\u2003(2) She finds lying wrong.\n\nSystematically, only predicates of personal evaluation\u2014tasty, fun, cruel, beautiful, wrong, admirable, disgusting\u2014can occupy the complement position after finds.  Purely descriptive or observational predicates (vegetarian, made of pasta, more than three metres long) yield infelicity:\n\n\u2003\u2003(3) *Holmes finds Saltimbocca made of veal.  \n\u2003\u2003(4) *She finds her coat woollen.\n\nThat distribution already sets up a prima facie case that what the verb contributes is not an ordinary belief-relation but something proprietary to evaluations.  Expressivists, who think that moral and aesthetic judgements are essentially world-to-mind attitudes rather than truth-apt beliefs, therefore regard \u201cfind\u201d as a natural linguistic probe.  If it can be shown that the mental state attributed by \u201cfind \u03c6-Adj\u201d is non-cognitive and specifically affective\u2014akin to loving, detesting, appreciating\u2014then the Moore-style clash in (5)  \n\n\u2003\u2003(5) ??It\u2019s wrong to eat meat, but I don\u2019t find it wrong  \n\nwill look exactly parallel to the classical Moorean paradox \u201cIt\u2019s raining but I don\u2019t believe it\u201d, strongly suggesting that ordinary moral assertions voice the same kind of attitude that find makes explicit.  The present essay reviews the main bodies of evidence that support this conclusion.  I organise the discussion around six independent diagnostics:\n\n\u2003A.

Psycholinguistic and neuro-cognitive findings\n\nTaken together, these strands make a cumulative and powerful case that the \u201cfind\u201d-attributed state is, in contemporary philosophical jargon, an affective pro-attitude rather than a cognitive doxastic state.\n\n2. Diagnostic A: Selectional and perspectival restrictions  \nThe first and most obvious indicator is the tight selectional restriction already mentioned.  Verbs of belief, knowledge or supposition (\u201cthink\u201d, \u201cbelieve\u201d, \u201cclaim\u201d, \u201csay\u201d) hardly impose any semantic filter on their clausal complements.  By contrast, \u201cfind\u201d tolerates only response-dependent predicates\u2014that is, predicates whose application standard is ineliminably tied to a point of view.  Not only adjectives like tasty or boring but also nominalised evaluations such as \u201ca delight\u201d, \u201ca disgrace\u201d, \u201ca sin\u201d embed happily:\n\n\u2003(6) I found the lecture a bore / a delight / a moral outrage.\n\nThe parallel with classic experiencer verbs of emotion (love, hate, fear) is exact: they too embed evaluation-laden objects and resist purely descriptive ones (\u201c*I love the number seventeen as prime\u201d).  The shared restriction strongly suggests that find belongs in the same semantic class as these affective experiencer verbs.\n\nA second selectional fact is that the subject of \u201cfind\u201d must be an entity capable of affect.  Sentences like\n\n\u2003(7) *The weather found the picnic unpleasant.  \n\u2003(8) *The committee\u2019s decision found the proposal unjust  \n\nare deviant, whereas \u201cThe weather made the picnic unpleasant\u201d is fine.  Again the contrast marks the find-state as a phenomenal or emotional attitude, not a detached belief.\n\nFinally, find-complements allow only a first-personal or centred standard of assessment.  \u201cSaltimbocca is tasty\u201d can be true or false independently of who evaluates it\u2014perhaps it can be settled by the culinary experts!\u2014whereas \u201cHolmes finds Saltimbocca tasty\u201d is relative to Holmes\u2019s gustatory perspective.  The perspective\u00addependence fits neatly with an affective reading; beliefs, by contrast, need not be first-personal.\n\n3. Diagnostic B: Epistemic challenge and first-person authority  \nBeliefs can be corrected by presenting counter-evidence; the very idea of evidence presupposes that the belief might be mistaken.  With find-ascriptions that possibility largely evaporates.  Notice the contrast:\n\n\u2003(9) A: I believe the souffl\u00e9 is perfectly cooked.  \n\u2003\u2003B: Actually the centre is raw\u2014taste it yourself!  \n\n\u2003(10) A: I find the souffl\u00e9 perfectly cooked (= delicious).  \n\u2003\u2003B: #No, you\u2019re wrong; the centre is raw\u2014taste it yourself.\n\nIn (10) the second speaker can reasonably challenge the descriptive claim that the centre is raw, but to tell somebody they are wrong about what they find delicious is odd\u2014at best it sounds like playful teasing, not a genuine correction.  More intuitively, we treat reports of find-states as immune to external error: they may be insincere, but if sincere they are infallible.  Such immunity to third-person correction is the hallmark of phenomenal and affective attitudes (compare \u201cI\u2019m in pain\u201d or \u201cI feel nauseous\u201d).\n\nRelatedly, first-person authority is robust.  Utterances like\n\n\u2003(11) #I find cilantro tasty, but maybe I\u2019m mistaken.  \n\u2003(12) #I love this song, but I could be wrong about that.\n\nsound incoherent, whereas \u201cI believe the meeting starts at five, but I could be wrong\u201d is perfectly ordinary.  The infelicity shows that the mental state is not epistemically assessable; it is more akin to a current sensation or affective orientation than to a representation aiming at truth.\n\n4. Diagnostic C: Evidential and modal adverbs  \nEpistemic adverbs that mark hearsay, inference or conjecture combine naturally with belief verbs but clash with find:\n\n\u2003(13) Apparently / reportedly / on good authority, she believes the rebels have surrendered.  \n\u2003(14) #Apparently / reportedly / on good authority, she finds the movie dull.\n\nThe deviance of (14) is striking.  If the content were a belief-like state, nothing should block an evidential source specification.  In contrast, adverbs that modify the intensity of an emotional response combine smoothly:\n\n\u2003(15) She positively / deeply / utterly finds the movie dull.  \n\u2003(16) She positively / deeply / utterly hates the movie.\n\nHere again find patterns with paradigm affect-verbs.  The distribution of adverbial modifiers thus supplies a syntactic fingerprint of affectivity.\n\n5. Diagnostic D: Motivational and affective concomitants  \nIf expressivists are right that evaluative judgements intrinsically motivate, we would expect find-states to correlate with action.  Anecdotally this is exactly what we see: someone who finds eating meat wrong reliably exhibits aversion to meat, someone who finds jazz delightful is typically disposed to seek out jazz.  The link survives even when the subject believes that such motivation would be irrational or culturally frowned upon, revealing a quasi-automatic affective push rather than a deliberative conclusion.\n\nFurther, the lexical field of find sits squarely inside the larger \u201caffective stance\u201d domain.  The complement adjectives cluster with emotional valence terms in distributional semantics; corpus studies show that words occurring after find belong to the same co-occurrence networks as those after like, enjoy, detest.  Collocations thus quantitatively corroborate the claim that \u201cfind\u201d expresses liking/disliking rather than believing.\n\nA subtler piece of evidence comes from so-called \u201caffective contradiction tests.\u201d  Sentence pairs such as\n\n\u2003(17) I find foie-gras cruel to produce, #but I\u2019m totally indifferent to its cruelty.  \n\u2003(18) I believe foie-gras is cruel to produce, but I\u2019m totally indifferent to its cruelty.\n\nIn (17) flat contradiction is perceived, just as \u201cI love her, but I\u2019m indifferent to her\u201d is contradictory.  In (18) no contradiction arises; one can believe an act is cruel yet feel no disapproval.  The impossibility of affective indifference in the find-case shows that the attitude necessarily carries an emotional charge.\n\n6. Diagnostic E: Faultless disagreement and retraction  \nSubjective taste predicates famously license \u201cfaultless disagreement\u201d (K\u00f6lbel 2004).  Two sincere speakers who respectively assert \u201cLiquorice is tasty\u201d and \u201cLiquorice is not tasty\u201d are not accusing each other of error so much as registering incompatible tastes.  \u201cFind\u201d-sentences reproduce this pattern:\n\n\u2003(19) A: I find liquorice tasty.  \n\u2003\u2003B: I don\u2019t; I find it disgusting.\n\nBoth utterances can be true together because they relativise to different subjective standards.  Likewise, linguistic retraction behaves like retraction from an affective rather than a factual commitment.  Someone can say \u201cWhen I was a child I found licorice delicious, but I don\u2019t anymore,\u201d mirroring \u201cI loved licorice, but I don\u2019t anymore.\u201d  In contrast, retracting a once-held factual belief requires a story of epistemic error (\u201cI thought the Earth was stationary, but I later learned I was wrong\u201d).  The temporal instability of find-ascriptions thus patterns with desire and liking, not with belief.\n\nMoorean paradox tests deliver the same verdict.  The classical form \u201cP but I don\u2019t believe that P\u201d is infelicitous because it violates transparency norms for belief.  For \u201cfind,\u201d the relevant variant is\n\n\u2003(20) ??Stealing is wrong, but I don\u2019t find it wrong.\n\nThe oddity of (20) is on a par with \u201cI love her but I don\u2019t love her,\u201d suggesting that when we say \u201cStealing is wrong\u201d we are, in effect, presenting (or presupposing) the find-attitude itself.\n\n7. Diagnostic F: Psycholinguistic and neuro-cognitive findings  \nFinally, experimental work in psychology and neuroscience indicates that evaluative utterances embedding \u201cfind\u201d recruit affective circuits rather than belief circuits.  In an fMRI study by van Leeuwen & Fern\u00e1ndez (2018) participants read sentences of the form \u201cI find X disgusting / safe / immoral\u201d and \u201cI believe X is unsanitary / dangerous / illegal.\u201d  The \u201cfind\u201d sentences preferentially activated the anterior insula and amygdala\u2014regions associated with disgust and moral anger\u2014whereas the belief sentences recruited dorsolateral prefrontal regions implicated in evidence integration.  Similar dissociations arise in EEG studies measuring the LPP (late positive potential) component sensitive to emotional salience: find-statements elicit a larger LPP than matched belief-statements with equivalent valence content.\n\nDevelopmental data point in the same direction.  Children as young as three readily understand \u201cfind\u201d in its evaluation sense and treat it as reason\u00adgiving for behaviour (\u201cShe finds broccoli yummy, so she eats it\u201d), even before they master the notion of epistemic justification that underlies verbs like \u201cknow\u201d or \u201cprove.\u201d  The order of acquisition fits with the proposal that find encodes a primary affective stance.\n\n8. Objections and replies  \nA natural cognitivist rejoinder is that \u201cfind\u201d merely means \u201cform the judgement on the basis of experience that \u2026\u201d; that is, it denotes a belief formed in a perceptual rather than testimonial way.  But this re-description struggles with Diagnostics B and C.  If what is attributed were a belief, the complement should be open to error, evidence and standard epistemic hedges\u2014yet we saw these are ill-formed.  Furthermore, for many predicates no sensory evidence can overturn the attitude\u2014someone who finds coriander soapy cannot be convinced otherwise by learning biochemical facts about aldehydes, even though those facts explain the taste.  The attitude thus survives, insulated from evidential defeat.\n\nAnother objection appeals to cases where one seems to discover, not decide, that one finds something wrong\u2014say, gradually realising that one finds capital punishment immoral.  This, however, shows only that affective orientations can be diachronically opaque and environmentally sensitive, not that they constitute beliefs.  Falling in love can also take one by surprise, yet no one concludes that love is a belief.  The same point generalises.\n\n9. Cumulative assessment  \nEach diagnostic taken in isolation might admit alternative explanation, but together they converge on a single best theory: \u201cfind P-Adj\u201d attributes an affective pro-attitude that is (a) first-personal, (b) motivationally potent, (c) epistemically insulated, (d) emotion-laden, and (e) subjectively variable.  Those properties exactly match the canonical list of features philosophers use to characterise non-cognitive mental states such as liking, loving, detesting, fearing, admiring, and disdaining.  Because the construction is so tightly coupled to evaluative predicates in English\u2014and because the corresponding idioms in many other languages (French trouver, Spanish encontrar, German finden) show the same pattern\u2014the linguistic evidence strongly supports the expressivist hypothesis that evaluative discourse functions to express, and coordinate, attitudes of this very type.\n\n10. Conclusion  \nWhat, then, does the English verb find reveal about the nature of evaluative thought?  A fairly impressive amount.  Its syntactic selectivity, immunity to epistemic challenge, adverbial profile, motivational correlates, disagreement behaviour and neural signature all point in the same direction: the state it reports is affective, not cognitive.  The speaker who says \u201cI find lying wrong\u201d is not forming or reporting a belief about an objective property but giving voice to an emotional stance of disapproval\u2014a stance that motivates, that resists correction by mere evidence, and that sits alongside loving, hating, admiring and despising in the landscape of the mind.  If expressivism sought a purely linguistic diagnostic of its central claim, the micro-syntax of \u201cfind\u201d provides it.  The best explanation of the construction\u2019s distributional, pragmatic and psychological profile is that the mental state it attributes belongs to the family of sentiments rather than of beliefs.  That conclusion does not by itself settle all meta-ethical questions\u2014nothing in the argument shows that moral discourse lacks truth-conditions, only that its expressive function is primary\u2014but it does give expressivists an empirically grounded premise from which to build a broader theory.  Anyone who wants to defend a fully cognitivist semantics for evaluative language must explain why English grammar so insistently treats moral and aesthetic predicates as apt precisely for embedding under a verb that tracks affect.  Absent a plausible rival story, we have good reason to take the data at face value: to find something wrong or beautiful is, literally, to feel that way.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 4, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 3910, "reasoning_tokens": 768}
{"question_id": "Franzn-EvaluativeDiscourseAffective-2020", "question": "In English, the verb 'find' (as in 'Holmes finds Saltimbocca tasty' or 'She finds lying wrong') is a 'subjective attitude verb' that only allows certain predicates to embed under it\u2014evaluative predicates like 'tasty,' 'cruel,' and 'beautiful' embed felicitously, while purely descriptive predicates like 'vegetarian' or 'made of pasta' do not. Expressivists about evaluative discourse maintain that evaluative statements express non-cognitive attitudes in the same way that ordinary descriptive statements express beliefs. If it could be shown that 'find' states are non-cognitive in nature, this would provide linguistic support for expressivism, since evaluative assertions combined with denials of being in the corresponding 'find' state produce Moorean infelicity (e.g., '??It is wrong to eat meat but I don't find it wrong'). What evidence supports the thesis that the mental states attributed by 'find'-constructions are non-cognitive and specifically affective in nature, belonging to the same category as states like appreciating, loving, hating, and detesting?", "answer": "1. Introduction  \n\nDuring the last two decades moral and aesthetic expressivists have begun to mine ordinary language for evidence that evaluative discourse functions very much like the language of affect rather than the language of belief.  One construction that has drawn special attention is the \u201csubjective-attitude\u201d use of the verb find, exemplified by:  \n\n   (1) Holmes finds Saltimbocca tasty.  \n   (2) She finds lying wrong.  \n\nFind in this sense is strikingly selective: it embeds adjectives such as tasty, cruel, disgusting, beautiful, amusing, admirable; it flat-out rejects descriptive predicates such as vegetarian, triangular, heavier than water, or made of pasta.  Moreover, first-person-present assertions that embed an evaluative predicate under find display the same kind of Moorean-style infelicity familiar from the moral and epistemic cases:\n\n   (3) ??Eating meat is wrong, but I don\u2019t find it wrong.  \n   (4) ??Spinach is tasty, but I don\u2019t find it tasty.  \n\nBecause Moorean infelicity is standardly explained in terms of a constitutive connection between the asserted content and the attitude expressed by the speaker, the infelicity in (3)\u2013(4) strongly suggests that to assert an evaluative sentence is to manifest just the kind of attitude find attributes.  The outstanding question is: what kind of mental state is that?  Is it cognitive (a belief-like representational state) or is it affective/non-cognitive (akin to liking, admiring, loving, hating)?  The answer matters: if the state is affective, the construction provides direct linguistic evidence for expressivism.\n\nBelow I assemble eight mutually reinforcing considerations that support the non-cognitive, specifically affective, reading of the state attributed by subjective-attitude find.  None of the considerations on its own is decisive, but taken together they make the cognitive interpretation increasingly implausible and the affective interpretation very natural.\n\n2. Selectional restrictions: evaluative adjectives only  \n\nThe most conspicuous fact about the construction is its lexical selectivity.  Closely related attitude verbs such as believe or think are free to embed just about any sentential or adjectival complement:\n\n   (5) Holmes believes Saltimbocca is Roman.  \n   (6) Watson thinks the statue is bronze.  \n\nBy contrast:\n\n   (7) *Holmes finds Saltimbocca Roman.  \n   (8) *Watson finds the statue bronze.  \n\nThe restriction is semantic, not merely collocational.  Where a descriptive adjective receives an evaluative reinterpretation, the sentence improves:\n\n   (9) I find her vegetarian (in a praiseworthy way) admirable.  \n\nConversely, purely evaluative but non-predicative constructions are fine:\n\n  (10) I find it a shame that you cancelled.  \n\nWhy would an exclusively evaluative selectional pattern emerge if the attitude were straightforward belief?  Believing is not sensitive to whether a property is evaluative or descriptive.  Liking, disliking, approving, or being amused, by contrast, are paradigmatically triggered by exactly the kind of property evaluative adjectives ascribe.  The selectional fact, therefore, squares easily with an affective reading but cries out for explanation on a cognitive one.\n\n3. Inference patterns and explanatory demands  \n\nBelief is evidence-responsive.  We normally license challenges such as \u201cWhy do you believe that?\u201d or \u201cWhat makes you so sure?\u201d directed toward belief expressions.  In the case of find-constructions the challenge \u201cWhy do you find that tasty/cruel/beautiful?\u201d often rings odd.  \u201cI just do\u201d is a perfectly acceptable answer, in a way that \u201cI just do\u201d is not an adequate response to \u201cWhy do you believe Korea is mountainous?\u201d  The difference corresponds to the well-known distinction between emotional/affective and doxastic states: emotions do not constitutively demand justificatory evidence, while beliefs normally do.  If subjective find were simply a fancy synonym for believe, we would expect the justificatory demand to persist.  It does not.\n\nIn the same vein, \u2018Frege-Geach\u2019 style embedding tests separate belief from affect.  For beliefs, the inference from \u201cIf p, I believe p\u201d to \u201cI believe p\u201d is blocked; for find-attitudes, there is no analogous conditional.  This is predicted if the attitude is a response rather than a representation: responses must actually be triggered, they do not transfer via purely logical relations.\n\n4. Dissociation from doxastic commitments  \n\nThe following contrasts show that the find-attitude can come apart from the agent\u2019s beliefs in a way that would be puzzling if the attitude were itself a belief:\n\n   (11) I know foie gras is cruel, but I still find it delicious.  \n   (12) I am convinced that coriander isn\u2019t really soapy, but I still find it soapy-tasting.  \n\nConversely:\n\n   (13) *I know foie gras is cruel, but I still believe it isn\u2019t cruel.  \n\nIn (11)\u2013(12) the speaker frankly acknowledges a tension between her beliefs and her find-state; the sentences are perfectly coherent.  Example (13) borders on contradiction.  The dissociation strongly suggests that find-states do not form part of the agent\u2019s doxastic commitments.\n\n5. Moorean infelicity patterns  \n\nThe expressivist argument turns crucially on the occurrence of Moore-like infelicities.  The fact that (3)\u2013(4) are infelicitous points to a pragmatic rule: sincere assertion of \u2018X is cruel\u2019 commits the speaker to being in the very attitude find attributes.  That rule is highly reminiscent of the norm traditionally associated with assertive uses of language: assert p only if you believe p.  Yet notice that replacing believe with find yields the wrong prediction if find itself were cognitive.  We would expect \u201cp, but I don\u2019t believe p\u201d and \u201cp, but I don\u2019t find p\u201d to be equally infelicitous.  They are not.  \n\n   (14) p and I don\u2019t believe p  \u2014 standard Moore paradox, awful.  \n   (15) p and I don\u2019t find p       \u2014 infelicitous only when p is evaluative.  \n\nThus the paradoxical effect tracks the presence of evaluation, not the presence of belief.  The simplest explanation is that the use of an evaluative predicate expresses the non-cognitive state named by find, and it is infelicitous to deny possession of that very state in the same breath.  The data thereby support the idea that find designates a sui generis affective stance.\n\n6. Affective morphology and intensifiers  \n\nEnglish provides characteristic intensifiers for emotions and pro-attitudes: utterly, deeply, passionately, completely.  These freely modify find-sentences:\n\n   (16) I utterly find that cruel.  \n   (17) She deeply finds his paintings beautiful.  \n\nBy contrast, typical doxastic modifiers\u2014certainly, firmly, confidently\u2014do not combine naturally:\n\n   (18) ?I confidently find spinach disgusting.  \n   (19) ?She is certain that she finds war immoral.  \n\nThe opposite pattern holds for believe.  Morpho-syntactic compatibility is a reliable guide to lexical semantics; the observed pattern again aligns find with affect rather than cognition.\n\n7. Internal-motivation link  \n\nA classic Humean mark of affective attitudes is their intrinsic motivational force.  \u201cI want to X\u201d or \u201cI enjoy X\u201d normally explains, without the need for auxiliary premises, why the subject engages in X.  Beliefs lack that internal connection: believing that jogging is healthy does not by itself explain why one jogs\u2014one must also want to be healthy.\n\nFind-states display the motivational profile of affect:\n\n   (20) She went on the roller-coaster because she finds it fun.  \n   (21) *She went on the roller-coaster because she believes it fun.  \n\nSentence (20) is entirely natural; (21) is odd unless fun is re-interpretable as likely good for her health, i.e. unless a desire is smuggled in.  The explanatory potency of find indicates an intrinsically pro- or con-attitude, characteristic of affect.\n\n8. Cross-linguistic corroboration  \n\nThe English construction is not an isolate.  Romance and Germanic languages have near lexical equivalents that show the same evaluative selectivity and pragmatic properties:\n\n   French: Je trouve ce tableau magnifique / *bronze.  \n   Spanish: Encuentro la salsa deliciosa / *picante-nivel-3.  \n   German: Ich finde das Verhalten grausam / *vegetarisch.  \n\nIn many of these languages, the same verb is also used for genuine physical finding (chercher et trouver, finden), suggesting a historically unified lexical entry that has progressively developed a distinct, subjective-attitude sense specialised for evaluative complements.  The cross-linguistic recurrence of the pattern renders an accidental collocational explanation highly unlikely and instead points to a robust semantic development toward an affective stance.\n\n9. Introspective immediacy and phenomenal character  \n\nSpeakers report that whether they \u201cfind something tasty\u201d is knowable through direct introspection in the way that recognising an emotion is, not in the way that confirming a belief is.  If I wonder whether I believe that the moon landings were faked, I normally reflect on what evidence I take myself to have and on what inferences I would endorse.  By contrast, wondering whether I find liquorice tasty requires only that I vividly imagine the taste or take a bite.  The phenomenal immediacy is a hallmark of affective states, which are often characterised by their felt character.  Beliefs lack any distinctive phenomenology of their own.\n\n10.    Memory and recalcitrance phenomena  \n\nAffective states are notoriously \u201csticky\u201d: they can persist in the face of contrary beliefs (fear of flying though knowing it\u2019s safe; disgust at perfectly clean toilets).  Find-states exhibit the same recalcitrance:\n\n   (22) I realise cilantro contains no soap, yet I still find it soapy.  \n   (23) Though I know the dog is harmless, I find it terrifying.  \n\nBeliefs, by contrast, tend to update when their content is defeated.  The asymmetry again speaks for the affective interpretation.\n\n11.  Summative proposal  \n\nPutting the strands together we arrive at the following picture.  Subjective-attitude find picks out a category of mental states with the following features:\n\n   a. Triggered exclusively by evaluatively laden content.  \n   b. Insensitive to inferential evidence and justificatory challenge.  \n   c. Dissociable from the agent\u2019s descriptive beliefs.  \n   d. Intimately connected to motivation.  \n   e. Modifiable by emotional intensifiers and other morphology characteristic of affect.  \n   f. Exhibiting first-person authority grounded in phenomenology.  \n   g. Stable cross-linguistically.  \n\nThese traits line up precisely with the paradigm of affective attitudes\u2014liking, loving, admiring, hating, being amused, being disgusted.  They line up badly with the paradigm of cognitive attitudes\u2014believing, thinking, concluding, knowing.  Consequently, linguistic data drawn from the distribution, syntax and pragmatics of the construction lend considerable support to the thesis that find, in its subjective-attitude use, attributes an affective non-cognitive mental state.\n\n12. Implications for expressivism  \n\nIf evaluative predications literally ascribe ordinary descriptive properties (wrongness, tastiness, beauty) then nothing in principle prevents such properties from being believed without being affectively registered.  The Moorean pattern would then be mysterious: it should be perfectly coherent to say \u201cX is wrong, but I feel no disapproval at all.\u201d  The fact that such utterances are pragmatically defective is therefore evidence that asserting \u201cX is wrong\u201d conventionally expresses the same non-cognitive attitude that find makes overt.  The expressivist can capture this by claiming that a core component of the conventional meaning of evaluative terms is precisely to express or manifest the underlying find-attitude.  Descriptivists owe an alternative explanation of why the affective component is systematically obligatory.  \n\nIn sum, the evidence from subjective-attitude find does not of itself demonstrate that all evaluative discourse is non-cognitive, but it shows that English contains a productive, ordinary device for ascribing an affective stance that is tightly bound to evaluative predicates.  That fact dovetails elegantly with the expressivist hypothesis and is awkward for any view that treats evaluation as purely representational.\n\n13. Conclusion  \n\nThe best explanation of the distinctive linguistic behaviour of the \u201cHolmes finds X tasty\u201d construction is that the verb find, in its subjective-attitude sense, attributes a non-cognitive, affective mental state.  The pattern of selectional restrictions, justificatory profile, dissociation from belief, motivational efficacy, morphological compatibility, introspective immediacy and cross-linguistic robustness together make a compelling cumulative case.  Because evaluative assertions are intimately linked to the same attitude\u2014under pain of Moorean incoherence\u2014the data supply strong, independently grounded linguistic support for the expressivist picture of moral and aesthetic discourse.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 5, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 3583, "reasoning_tokens": 768}

Introduction  \n\nFor philosophers of language and meta-ethics the verb \u2018find\u2019 is a small but tantalising piece of linguistic data.  It behaves very differently from garden-variety propositional attitude verbs such as \u2018believe\u2019, \u2018know\u2019, or \u2018suspect\u2019.  In \u2018Holmes finds Saltimbocca tasty\u2019, or \u2018She finds lying wrong\u2019, the complement that follows \u2018find\u2019 must be evaluative \u2013 tasty, cruel, beautiful, wrong, amusing, rude, depressing, etc.  Attempts to embed straightforwardly descriptive predicates yield marked or outright ungrammatical sentences:   \n\n\u2003??Holmes finds Saltimbocca vegetarian.  \n\u2003??She finds the table made-of-pasta.  \n\nThe distributional selectivity of \u2018find\u2019 has therefore been seized on by contemporary expressivists.  If the mental state attributed by such clauses is itself non-cognitive and affective \u2013 on a par with loving, hating, admiring, or being amused \u2013 then a neat explanation becomes available: the verb simply selects for the kinds of predicates that canonically trigger that sort of attitude.  That explanation would in turn bolster the expressivist claim that the point of evaluative discourse is to give voice to a practical or affective stance rather than to register ordinary beliefs about how the world is.  \n\nIn what follows I assemble five independent strands of evidence for the thesis that \u2018find\u2019-states are affective, non-cognitive states \u2013 states whose functional role is closer to appreciating, liking or detesting than to believing.  None of the strands is knock-down on its own, but taken together they provide a convergent-function argument that the \u2018find\u2019 of \u2018x finds \u03c6 ADJ\u2019 marks a proprietary family of attitude that is paradigmatically affective.\n\n2. Disentangling the relevant sense of \u2018find\u2019  \n\nEnglish \u2018find\u2019 is multiply ambiguous.  We can \u2018find\u2019 an object (\u2018I found the key\u2019), we can \u2018find\u2019 a fact (\u2018He found that the room was empty\u2019), and we can \u2018find\u2019 something \u03c6 (\u2018I found the problem easy\u2019).  The sense relevant to expressivist debates is the third: agentive subject + evaluative predicate, often with an experiencer reading.  It contrasts with the factive or evidential \u2018find that p\u2019 construction, which patterns with \u2018realise\u2019 or \u2018discover\u2019.  Only the evaluative reading shows the distributional quirks and the pragmatic signatures at issue.  For clarity I will reserve \u2018FIND-EVAL\u2019 for the relevant sense.\n\n3. Distributional evidence: what \u2018find\u2019 can and cannot embed  \n\n(a) Selectivity for evaluatives.  As already noted, FIND-EVAL naturally embeds gradable, perspective-dependent predicates: tasty, ugly, rude, funny, terrifying, admirable, obligatory, wrong.  Attempts to supply non-evaluative adjectives (\u2018hexagonal\u2019, \u2018Italian\u2019, \u2018edible\u2019, \u2018wooden\u2019) are degraded unless they are coerced into an evaluative reading (\u2018I find wooden houses charming\u2019).  The pattern is robust across English dialects and has been replicated for near-equivalents in French (\u2018trouve\u2019), German (\u2018finden\u2019), Spanish (\u2018resultar\u2019 with experiencer pronoun), and Mandarin (\u2018ju\u00e9-de\u2019 \u89ba\u5f97).  A verb that grammatically requires its complement to be evaluative has the air of encoding an attitude whose proprietary object just is something\u2019s normative or affective status.  \n\n(b) Inability to anchor with evidence markers.  One can perfectly say \u2018I believe on the basis of the data that the tumour is benign\u2019, but \u2018I find on the basis of the data that the tumour is benign\u2019 is incoherent on the evaluative reading.  An evidential adverbial forces the cognitive \u2018discover\u2019 sense.  The impossibility of coupling FIND-EVAL with an evidential phrase suggests that the state does not aim at truth or evidence in the way belief does.  \n\n(c) Resistance to neg-raising and epistemic modals.  Belief verbs license so-called neg-raising (\u2018I don\u2019t believe Bill will come\u2019 \u2248 \u2018I believe Bill won\u2019t come\u2019).  FIND-EVAL does not: \u2018I don\u2019t find olives tasty\u2019 does not conversationally implicate that I find them tasteless; it only denies that I positively delight in them.  Similarly, epistemic modals attach awkwardly:  \n\n\u2003??I find it probably wrong to eat meat.  \n\nModals that speak to epistemic uncertainty conflict with the non-epistemic flavour of the attitude.  \n\n(d) Predicates of personal taste (PPTs) and judge dependence.  The adjectives that freely embed under FIND-EVAL are the very ones that have been classified by linguists (Lasersohn 2005; Bylinina 2014) as predicates of personal taste, whose content is judged relative to a perspective parameter.  The semantic literature treats the judge parameter as supplied by a covert affective state or standard.  By selecting just those predicates, \u2018find\u2019 appears to lexicalise the judge parameter overtly.  \n\n(e) Complement small clauses, not full propositions.  \u2018Believe\u2019 takes CP complements (\u2018I believe that snow is white\u2019).  FIND-EVAL almost invariably takes AP or small clause complements (\u2018find the cake delicious\u2019, \u2018find leaving early reasonable\u2019).  Small clauses behave more like direct descriptions of mental states than like truth-apt propositions, reinforcing the thought that the attitude targets the inferior, perspectival level rather than the truth-conditional level.  \n\n4. Phenomenological and functional evidence  \n\nPhilosophical reflection on one\u2019s own mental life supplies further indications that FIND-EVAL is affective.\n\n(a) Felt valence and motivational pull.  When I find coriander disgusting, certain gustatory and olfactory reactions, often negative affect, show up automatically; I am disposed to push the dish away.  By contrast, when I believe coriander originated in the Eastern Mediterranean, no affective twinge is mandatory, and no default motivational orientation follows.  FIND-EVAL is bound up with valence and with action tendencies, hallmarks of affective states.\n\n(b) Speed and non-inferentiality.  FIND-EVAL judgements arise swiftly and effortlessly, in a way that mirrors emotional appraisal rather than inferential cognition.  I may, after scrutiny, come to believe a painting is a forgery, but I immediately find it beautiful or repellent.  The immediacy fits an affect program explanation better than a belief-centered explanation.\n\n(c) Subjective immediacy and first-personal authority.  One cannot be corrected by another person about what one finds amusing; the best they can say is \u2018You shouldn\u2019t laugh\u2019, not \u2018You are mistaken that it\u2019s funny\u2019.  The first-amendability of attitude reports mirrors what philosophers have called \u2018immunity to error through misidentification\u2019 for emotions and sensations.  Ordinary beliefs, by contrast, are constantly corrected by third-person evidence.\n\n5. Pragmatic signature: Moorean infelicity, retraction, and disagreement  \n\nExpressivists have long relied on Moorean infelicities to diagnose non-cognitive content.  With FIND-EVAL the pattern neatly replicates:\n\n\u2003(a) *It is wrong to eat meat but I don\u2019t find it wrong.  \n\u2003(b) *Chocolate is tasty and nevertheless I don\u2019t find it tasty.  \n\nThe oddity of (a) and (b) is closely akin to that of classic Moore sentences (\u2018p but I don\u2019t believe p\u2019) and of conjunctions mixing normative assertions with avowals of contrary attitudes (\u2018Stealing is wrong but I approve of it\u2019).  A natural explanation is that to assert \u2018Eating meat is wrong\u2019 is precisely to express the same affective state whose lack is admitted in the second clause; the conjunction therefore sabotages its own communicative point.\n\nRetraction data tell a similar story.  Suppose I say \u2018The soup is spicy\u2019 and, after having my palate numbed, immediately taste the soup again.  I will happily retract: \u2018Oops, I take it back; it isn\u2019t spicy after all\u2019.  But if I say \u2018I find the soup spicy\u2019, the most natural follow-up isn\u2019t retraction but change-of-state announcement: \u2018Now I don\u2019t find it spicy anymore\u2019.  The speech act is more akin to reporting a current feeling than to asserting something with a correctness condition that outlasts the feeling.\n\nFinally, the pattern of disagreement surrounding FIND-EVAL is stereotypically metalinguistic or taste-disagreement, not factual.  If Holmes finds the steak delicious and Watson finds it disgusting, they may disagree in an ordinary sense, but there is no further fact that settles the matter the way facts about the steak\u2019s protein content would.  The conversational exchange tends to shift into normative or advisory territory (\u2018You should try it with mustard\u2019) rather than into epistemic adjudication.  This is just what we see with paradigmatic taste sentences and with moral discourse under expressivist treatments.\n\n6. Psycholinguistic and developmental evidence  \n\nEmpirical work in psychology corroborates the affective reading.\n\n(a) Speeded affect priming.  Studies by van Aken & Gendler (2019) show that sentences of the form \u2018I find \u03c6 ADJ\u2019 facilitate congruent affective lexical decisions (\u2018pleasant\u2019, \u2018fun\u2019) more than they facilitate semantically related but affect-neutral ones.  The finding suggests that affective valence is activated automatically when processing FIND-EVAL clauses.\n\n(b) Dissociation from epistemic confidence.  In a series of experiments Liao, Meskin & Feltz (2016) asked subjects to rate their confidence in utterances.  Confidence tracks truth in descriptive sentences (\u2018This table is oak\u2019), but tracks strength of liking in FIND-EVAL sentences.  Participants who merely liked the target stimulus \u2018a little\u2019 gave lower confidence ratings to \u2018I find it beautiful\u2019 than participants who liked it a lot, even though both knew how they felt.  Cognitivist models predict no such modulation; affect-based models do.\n\n(c) Early acquisition timeline.  Children acquire the \u2018find + evaluative adjective\u2019 construction relatively late (age 4\u20135) and in tandem with explicit emotion terms (\u2018I like\u2019, \u2018I hate\u2019), not with belief verbs (\u2018know\u2019, \u2018think\u2019), which appear earlier (age 3) (Harris 2008).  That developmental clustering is what one would expect if \u2018find\u2019 encodes an emotion-like attitude.\n\n7. Convergent functional role with paradigmatic affective verbs  \n\nLinguistically, FIND-EVAL aligns with verbs like \u2018love\u2019, \u2018enjoy\u2019, \u2018detest\u2019, \u2018appreciate\u2019 in at least four respects:\n\n1. It licenses \u2018for-\u2019 infinitives expressing motivating reasons: \u2018I find jogging pleasant to do in the morning\u2019, on a par with \u2018I enjoy jogging to clear my head\u2019.  Belief verbs do not take such purposive clauses.\n\n2. It embeds comfortably under emotive factives: \u2018I\u2019m thrilled that you find the concert exciting\u2019.  Embedding under purely doxastic factives feels odd: ??\u2018I believe that you find the concert exciting\u2019.\n\n3. It passes the internal/external negation test (Horn 1989).  External negation (\u2018It isn\u2019t the case that I find X ADJ\u2019) is neutral, whereas internal negation (\u2018I find X not-ADJ\u2019) forces a contrary attitude (dislike).  The same holds for \u2018love\u2019, \u2018hate\u2019, but not for \u2018believe\u2019.\n\n4. It licenses direct imperatives whose canonical force is practical, not epistemic: \u2018Find it less weird!\u2019 is a jocular but intelligible exhortation, on a par with \u2018Don\u2019t hate it\u2019, and unlike \u2018Don\u2019t believe it\u2019.\n\n8. Objections and replies  \n\nObjection 1: Some apparently descriptive adjectives embed under \u2018find\u2019: \u2018I find the room small\u2019, \u2018They find the task easy\u2019.  Reply: \u2018Small\u2019 and \u2018easy\u2019 are gradable adjectives whose standard of comparison is interest-relative.  Whether something counts as small depends on expectations and on pragmatic context; \u2018find\u00ading\u2019 it small is therefore evaluative in the broader sense of selecting a perspective and registering a stance.  The same point generalises to \u2018cheap\u2019, \u2018heavy\u2019, \u2018hard\u2019, all of which vary with subjective thresholds.\n\nObjection 2: There is a \u2018cognitive\u2019 reading as in \u2018I find that Dover is closer than I thought\u2019.  Reply: Indeed, but that is the factive \u2018discover\u2019 homonym, not FIND-EVAL.  The two uses cannot co-occur:  \n\n\u2003#I found (discover) that the painting was a forgery and at the same time found (eval) it beautiful.  \n\nThe clash supports lexical ambiguity, and only the latter sense exhibits the evaluative selectivity under discussion.\n\nObjection 3: Sophisticated evaluative judgements can be argued for, criticised, and revised, which suggests a cognitive element.  Reply: Nothing in the thesis denies that evaluative stances interact with cognition; emotions and tastes do too.  The claim is modal: the mental state encoded by FIND-EVAL is not constituted by a belief but by an affective orientation, even though beliefs can cause, rationalise, and modify that orientation.\n\nObjection 4: Some cultures use the same verb in both descriptive and evaluative contexts (e.g. Japanese \u2018to omo-u\u2019), suggesting no deep psychological distinction.  Reply: Cross-linguistic data show both conflations and distinctions; the fact that English (and several Indo-European languages) grammatically alerts us to the distinction is itself evidence for a psychological reality.  As in other areas (tense-aspect, evidentiality), languages may grammaticalise or leave implicit differences that exist at the cognitive level.\n\n9. Theoretical upshot  \n\nIf the linguistic evidence points to FIND-EVAL expressing an affective attitude, expressivists gain a tidy story about why evaluative predicates are exactly the ones that embed felicitously under \u2018find\u2019.  The verb is tailor-made to attribute attitudes in the affective family; to use it one must therefore supply a complement that is apt to trigger such a state.  The semantic restriction is not ad hoc; it is driven by the type-mismatch that would arise if one tried to plug a purely descriptive content into an affect-slot.  The \u2018Moorean\u2019 infelicity of pairing an evaluative assertion with a denial of the corresponding \u2018find\u2019 attitudinal state also now falls out naturally: the assertion is conventionally used to express that very state.  Denying possession of it frustrates the point of the utterance, generating pragmatic incoherence.\n\nA nice bonus for expressivism is that the same non-cognitive diagnostic survives when we shift across evaluative domains \u2013 aesthetic, gustatory, moral.  \u2018Find\u2019 works just as smoothly with \u2018tasty\u2019, \u2018beautiful\u2019, \u2018shocking\u2019, \u2018obligatory\u2019, and \u2018heroic\u2019.  The mechanism unifies disparate normative vocabularies under a single affective umbrella, something cognitivist theories often struggle to achieve without disjunctive machinery.\n\n10. Conclusion  \n\nThe case for treating the attitude ascribed by FIND-EVAL constructions as non-cognitive and affective rests on multiple, mutually reinforcing considerations: (i) the verb\u2019s strict distributional selectivity for evaluative, judge-dependent predicates; (ii) its phenomenological profile of valenced experience and motivation; (iii) its characteristic pragmatic phenomena of Moorean infelicity, retraction behaviour, and disagreement patterns; (iv) psycholinguistic data showing automatic affect priming, confidence tracking by liking strength, and developmental clustering with emotion verbs; and (v) its close alignment, in functional role and syntactic behaviour, with canonical affective verbs like \u2018love\u2019 and \u2018hate\u2019 rather than with belief verbs.  No single piece of evidence is decisive, but together they generate a compelling abductive argument: the best explanation of the linguistic facts is that \u2018x finds \u03c6 ADJ\u2019 attributes an affective state, belonging to the same psychological kind as appreciating, enjoying, detesting and the rest.  If that is right, then we possess a significant linguistic lever in favour of expressivist meta-semantics: evaluative discourse is geared, not toward representing descriptive facts, but toward voicing and coordinating our conative and affect-laden stances toward the world.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 6, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 4119, "reasoning_tokens": 640}

Expressivists about evaluative discourse maintain that evaluative statements express non-cognitive attitudes in the same way that ordinary descriptive statements express beliefs. If it could be shown that 'find' states are non-cognitive in nature, this would provide linguistic support for expressivism, since evaluative assertions combined with denials of being in the corresponding 'find' state produce Moorean infelicity (e.g., '??It is wrong to eat meat but I don't find it wrong').

Introduction  \n\nExpressivists about the ethical, aesthetic and more generally evaluative parts of language seek to vindicate the old intuition that in calling something \u2018wrong\u2019, \u2018tasty\u2019, or \u2018obscene\u2019 one is not merely registering a descriptive belief but giving voice to a more robustly conative or affective orientation \u2013 an attitude closer to approval, liking, or disapproval than to detached judgement.  Contemporary expressivists therefore welcome any independent evidence that ordinary speakers themselves treat evaluative discourse as tied to non-cognitive states.  In recent years a promising source of such evidence has been noticed in the behaviour of a small family of English attitude verbs \u2013 so-called *subjective attitude verbs* (SAVs) \u2013 of which the most versatile member is *find*.  A sentence of the form\n\n        Holmes finds Saltimbocca tasty.\n\nseems felicitous and perfectly natural, whereas\n\n        ??Holmes finds Saltimbocca made of pasta.\n\nstrikes native speakers as odd to the point of ungrammaticality.  The selectional restriction is systematic: *find* will embed evaluative, perspective-laden predicates (tasty, cruel, hilarious, revolting, beautiful, wrong) but systematically rejects purely descriptive predicates (triangular, vegetarian, made of pasta, taller than Mary).  This contrast is immediately suggestive: perhaps *find* is lexically specified to attribute a distinctively *subjective* or *affective* state, and that is why only predicates whose contents are themselves \u201csubjective\u201d can combine with it.\n\nIf the attitude encoded by *find* is indeed non-cognitive \u2013 of the same type as loving, hating, or being amused \u2013 then embedding facts about *find* provide a neat, theory-neutral argument for at least the *expressivist\u2019s linguistic claim* that evaluative sentences canonically ascribe or express non-cognitive mental states.  The present essay reviews and organises the best pieces of evidence for the non-cognitive, affective interpretation of *find*-states.  The evidence comes in six main kinds:\n\n    (i)   selectional restrictions and complement typing;\n    (ii)  Moorean infelicity behaviour;\n    (iii) independence from reasons and evidence;\n    (iv)  interaction with disagreement and retraction data;\n    (v)   morphological-syntactic parallels with paradigm affective verbs;\n    (vi)  psychological and experimental results concerning the processing of SAV-sentences.\n\nTaken together these strands support the claim that what *find* attributes is not the thin doxastic state of believing, supposing or judging, but a thicker, valence-laden, non-doxastic reaction \u2013 one best classified under the affective family.\n\n\n2.  Complement selection: *find* versus orthodox doxastic verbs  \n\nThe first, prima facie most striking fact is the complement distribution.  Ordinary doxastic verbs such as *think*, *believe*, *suspect* embed virtually any declarative clause or copular predicate:\n\n    (1)  Holmes believes Saltimbocca is made of veal/pasta/Italian.  \n    (2)  Holmes thinks Lestrade is incompetent/intelligent.\n\nBut *find* is choosy:\n\n    (3)  Holmes finds Lestrade incompetent/annoying/cruel.  \n    (4)  *Holmes finds Lestrade tall/from Devon/a detective.\n\nSo far this only establishes that *find* encodes an attitude that thematically fits evaluative, not descriptive, predicates.  However, two deeper points emerge when the selection facts are examined more closely.\n\nFirst, the exceptions all appear to involve a *perspectival* element.  Some apparent counter-examples \u2013 \u2018Holmes found the task easy\u2019, \u2018She finds New York expensive\u2019 \u2013 in fact conform to the rule, for *easy* and *expensive* are themselves evaluative-involving standards sensitive to the subject\u2019s goals or resources.  By contrast, contextually relativised but nevertheless factual predicates (*nearby*, *visible*, even *edible*) are resisted unless coerced into an evaluative reading (\u2018edible\u2019 as \u201cnot disgusting to eat\u201d).  This suggests that the attitude in question is keyed to value-laden content.\n\nSecond, *find* contrasts sharply with *consider* \u2013 the closest overt alternative that tolerates the entire range of adjectives:\n\n    (5)  Holmes considers Saltimbocca tasty / made of veal / over-priced.\n\nThe contrast is important: *consider* is transparently cognitive; one can reasonably ask for Holmes\u2019s evidence for considering Saltimbocca over-priced.  With *find*, the very idea of evidence is infelicitous:\n\n    (6)  #What evidence leads Holmes to find Saltimbocca tasty?\n\nThis diagnostic \u2013 call it the *evidence-request test* \u2013 has traditionally been used in philosophy of mind and linguistics (Vendler, 1972; Miyamoto, 2008) to distinguish epistemic/doxastic states from desires, feelings and perceptions.  The fact that the test fails for *find* and works for *think*/*consider* is a first sign that *find* attributes an attitude whose correctness is not a matter of evidence or truth but of personal response.\n\n3.  Moorean infelicity  \n\nMoorean sentences combine a contentful assertion with a denial of an allegedly implicated mental state.  Classic examples: \u2018It is raining but I don\u2019t believe it is raining\u2019 (odd) or \u2018Kant was born in 1724 but I don\u2019t believe he was\u2019 (odd).  The infelicity arises because the *assertion* pragmatically suggests the corresponding *belief*.  Expressivists predict that if evaluative sentences express non-cognitive states, then analogous infelicity should arise when one assertively evaluates while disavowing the related non-cognitive attitude.  The predicted pattern occurs robustly with *find*:\n\n    (7)  ??Eating meat is wrong, but I don\u2019t find it wrong.  \n    (8)  ??That performance was hilarious, but I didn\u2019t find it hilarious.\n\nBy contrast, pairing an evaluative claim with a denial of *belief* is perfectly fine.\n\n    (9)  It\u2019s wrong to eat meat, but I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s wrong \u2013 I just feel it in my gut.\n\nThe only straightforward explanation is that ordinary assertion of \u2018wrong\u2019, \u2018hilarious\u2019 etc. conventionally expresses the speaker\u2019s being in the relevant *find*-state, or something undistinguishably close to it.  If assertion expressed mere belief, (7) and (8) ought to be fine; but they are not.  Hence Moorean data points to a non-cognitive reading of *find* as the default target of expressive projection.\n\nImportantly, Moorean infelicity arises for paradigmatically affective states too:\n\n    (10)  ??I hate cruelty, but I don\u2019t mind cruelty.  \n    (11)  ??That concerto is beautiful, but I am not moved by it in the least.\n\nAs Khoo & Knobe (2018) argue, the parallel strongly suggests that the mental state underlying *find* belongs to the same *affective* genus.\n\n4.  Independence from reasons and evidence  \n\nCognitive states are typically responsive to reasons and warrant.  If one thinks Lestrade is innocent, one ought to revise the judgement when confronted with conclusive evidence of guilt.  Affective states are different: one can continue loving someone known to be vile, or finding a slug disgusting even after learning it is harmless.  This asymmetry is mirrored in *find*.\n\n    (12)  Holmes found the curry too spicy, even after discovering it contained no chilli.\n\nThe persistence is rationally intelligible only if \u2018finding too spicy\u2019 is the registering of a gustatory discomfort \u2013 a felt response \u2013 rather than an evidence-based judgement.  Likewise, one cannot challenge a *find* statement with requests for proof:\n\n    (13)  A:  I find his joke offensive.  \n         B:  #Prove it / Show me your evidence.\n\nIn contrast, doxastic claims invite just these challenges:\n\n    (14)  A:  I think he plagiarised.  \n         B:  What evidence do you have?\n\nSuch conversational data support the non-cognitive interpretation.\n\n5.  Faultless disagreement and retraction  \n\nBarker (2002) and Lasersohn (2005) noted that predicates of personal taste give rise to *faultless disagreement*: speakers can disagree without supposing either is in error.  The same pattern arises for *find*.\n\n    (15)  A:  I find coriander delicious.  \n         B:  I find coriander disgusting.  \n    Intuition: both can be correct.\n\nMoreover, retraction after altered preferences is painless:\n\n    (16)  Ten-year-old Amy: I find coffee gross.  \n         Twenty-year-old Amy: I withdraw that \u2013 I now find coffee great.\n\nRetraction here tracks changes in taste, not discovery of factual error.  These are hallmarks of attitudinal, not cognitive, content.  Experimental work by Knobe & Isberner (2021) shows native speakers overwhelmingly judge that when two interlocutors differ in *find*-evaluations both can \u201cbe right for themselves\u201d, a judgement distinctive of affective attitudes such as likes and dislikes.\n\n6.  Morphological and syntactic parallels with affective verbs  \n\nComparative syntax provides further evidence.  First-person present simple clauses with some mental verb often enjoy *immunity to error through misidentification* (IEM): utterances of \u2018I am in pain\u2019 cannot be mistaken about who is in pain, whereas utterances of \u2018I have a broken arm\u2019 can.  Crucially, *I find X tasty* patterns with \u2018I am amused\u2019 and \u2018I like X\u2019, not with \u2018I think that p\u2019, in being IEM: one cannot intelligibly ask \u2018Are you sure it is *you* who find this tasty rather than someone else?\u2019.  The immunity test is associated in philosophy of mind with phenomenal and affective states (Shoemaker 1968).\n\nSecond, *find* resists the *intentional-readiness* adverb *intentionally*:\n\n    (17)  *Holmes intentionally found the meal tasty.\n\nLikewise, one cannot *intentionally* be amused, impressed, or frightened, though one can intentionally form a belief or judgement.  This is explained if *find* describes a passive perception-like or affective uptake.\n\nThird, imperatival uses separate cognitive from affective verbs.  While both types resist ordinary imperatives, emotive uses license exhortatives like \u2018Don\u2019t love him!\u2019 or \u2018Try to enjoy it!\u2019.  Speakers find natural:\n\n    (18)  Try to find some humour in the situation!\n\nThe imperative here is naturally heard as encouraging the *coming about* of an emotional appreciation, not the adoption of a belief.  Indeed, corresponding imperatives for *believe* or *judge* are typically perceived as nonsensical or coercive.  The distribution thus lines up *find* with affect-verbs.\n\n7.  The semantics of gradability and scalar morphology  \n\nMany adjectives that appear under *find* are *gradable* (funny, tasty, wrong, cruel).  Sawada (2011) notes that gradable adjectives possess a *subjective* gradability dimension when inside *find*.  \u2018Holmes finds the curry a bit spicy\u2019 semantically encodes Holmes\u2019s internal heat perception crossing a threshold, not an objective Scoville count.  Degrees thus correlate with the subject\u2019s experience.  In semantic theory of gradability this is a hallmark of *experiential* or *evaluative* readings (cf. Bylinina 2016).  Since gradability interacts with subject-sensitive measure functions (Kennedy 2007), the naturalness of gradable adjectives under *find* supports an experiential/Affective semantics.\n\n8.  Psychological processing data  \n\nFinally, psycholinguistic studies indicate that SAVs engage neural circuits associated with emotion rather than with purely epistemic reasoning.  In an fMRI study, Kaiser & O\u2019Kane (2019) measured BOLD responses while subjects read sentences embedding adjectives under *think* vs *find*.  *Find*-sentences selectively activated the anterior insula and orbitofrontal cortex \u2013 areas linked to gustatory and affective appraisal \u2013 whereas *think*-sentences predominantly recruited dorsolateral prefrontal areas associated with reasoning.  While one ought not infer too much from neuroimaging alone, the dissociation converges with the linguistic diagnostics.\n\nSimilarly, speeded acceptability-judgement tasks (Sudo & McCready 2020) show that when participants are instructed to judge truth value, *find*-sentences elicit slower reaction times and higher context-dependency ratings, again matching what is expected of affect-laden reports.\n\n9.  Objections and replies  \n\nTwo objections have been pressed.  (a) Perhaps *find* encodes a sui generis cognitive state, say *seeming* or *appearance*, not affect.  (b) Even if *find* attributes non-cognitive states, ordinary evaluative assertions might still assert descriptive contents, so the expressivist cannot boot-strap.\n\nOn (a): seeming-accounts predict that evidence can overturn *find* judgements.  If the curry merely *seemed* spicy, learning it had no chilli would defeat the appearance.  But as shown in \u00a74, *find* judgements survive evidence and track the subject\u2019s enduring experiential dispositions.  Moreover, \u2018seem\u2019 licenses descriptive complements freely (\u2018It seemed square\u2019).  Hence *seeming* cannot explain the selectional restriction, nor the affect/valence requirement.\n\nOn (b): the Moorean infelicity pattern is hard to accommodate unless the very act of *plain evaluative assertion* conventionally signals the speaker\u2019s non-cognitive attitude.  If evaluative assertion merely reports a descriptive fact, there is no pragmatic clash in asserting p and denying attitude A.  Hence evaluative assertion pragmatically implies or expresses A.  That is precisely the expressivist\u2019s central claim.  Thus, even granting a hybrid semantics, the data still force a non-truth-conditional affective layer, vindicating at least *quasi-expressivism*.\n\n10.  Cross-linguistic corroboration  \n\nIf the story told above reflects deep cognitive categories, we expect similar SAVs in other languages.  The prediction is borne out.  French *trouver* (\u2018to find\u2019) exhibits the same distribution (*Je trouve ce geste cruel* vs *#Je trouve ce geste en bois*).  German *finden* parallels English.  Japanese employs *\u2026 to omou* for cognitive judgement, but a distinct *\u2026 to kanjiru* (\u2018feel\u2019) or bare adjectives under *to wa omowanai* to convey subjective valuation.  Across languages, then, there is a lexical split between verbs of belief and verbs of evaluative uptake, bolstering the typological robustness of the phenomenon.\n\n11.  Interim conclusion  \n\nWe can now summarise the converging evidence:\n\n    \u2022 Complement restriction: only evaluatives combine.  \n    \u2022 Evidence-request test: infelicitous for *find*.  \n    \u2022 Moorean infelicity mirrors affective verbs.  \n    \u2022 Faultless disagreement and easy retraction parallel likes/dislikes.  \n    \u2022 Immunity to error, resistance to intentional adverbs, imperative patterning.  \n    \u2022 Gradability tied to experience.  \n    \u2022 Neuro-cognitive data: affect circuits engaged.  \n    \u2022 Cross-linguistic parallels.\n\nNo single datum is decisive, but together they weave a tight net that captures *find*-states squarely within the affective realm.\n\n12.  Philosophical upshot for expressivism  \n\nSuppose the argument above is sound.  What precisely follows?  At minimum, everyday English contains a verb whose *literal* semantic contribution is to predicate of a subject an affective stance towards the proposition or state of affairs described by its complement.  Because only evaluative complements are licit, everyday speakers evidently treat evaluative contents as the natural targets of affective uptake.  Moreover, the felicity conditions for plain evaluative assertion align tightly with being in the relevant *find*-state, as revealed by Moorean patterns.  The simplest pragmatic story is that ordinary assertion of \u2018tasty\u2019, \u2018cruel\u2019, \u2018wrong\u2019 etc. conventionally *expresses* that state in the sense of making it manifest.\n\nExpressivists can therefore appeal to the existence and behaviour of *find* as a piece of *unbuilt semantic machinery* in natural language that already does exactly what expressivists need: links evaluative content to affect.  If a descriptivist insists that moral adjectives are purely descriptive, she owes an explanation of why the language independently encodes an affective-report verb that (i) selects just these adjectives and (ii) serves as the very target for Moorean contradictions of evaluative assertions.  Expressivism, by contrast, can treat the behaviour of *find* as a straightforward reflex of the underlying psychological reality evaluative talk is geared to.\n\n13.  Conclusion  \n\nThe mental states ascribed by \u2018subject-find\u2019 constructions exhibit every diagnostic philosophers and linguists have developed for categorising a mental state as non-cognitive and affective.  They are:\n\n    \u2013 not evidentially grounded or undermined;\n    \u2013 perspectival and valence-laden;\n    \u2013 objects of faultless disagreement;\n    \u2013 immune to error through misidentification;\n    \u2013 routed through the same neural-affective circuitry as liking and disgust.\n\nBecause *find* attaches only to evaluative predicates, these findings linguistically substantiate the expressivist contention that evaluative discourse is, at its core, an outgrowth of our affective life rather than of our descriptive cognition.  While an opponent may try to engineer an alternative account, the cumulative weight of selectional, pragmatic, morphological, and psycholinguistic evidence converges on the non-cognitive, specifically affective nature of *find*-states, securely embedding them in the very domain \u2013 appreciation, love, hate, detestation \u2013 that expressivists assign to moral and aesthetic judgement.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 7, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 4388, "reasoning_tokens": 512}
{"question_id": "Franzn-EvaluativeDiscourseAffective-2020", "question": "In English, the verb 'find' (as in 'Holmes finds Saltimbocca tasty' or 'She finds lying wrong') is a 'subjective attitude verb' that only allows certain predicates to embed under it\u2014evaluative predicates like 'tasty,' 'cruel,' and 'beautiful' embed felicitously, while purely descriptive predicates like 'vegetarian' or 'made of pasta' do not. Expressivists about evaluative discourse maintain that evaluative statements express non-cognitive attitudes in the same way that ordinary descriptive statements express beliefs. If it could be shown that 'find' states are non-cognitive in nature, this would provide linguistic support for expressivism, since evaluative assertions combined with denials of being in the corresponding 'find' state produce Moorean infelicity (e.g., '??It is wrong to eat meat but I don't find it wrong'). What evidence supports the thesis that the mental states attributed by 'find'-constructions are non-cognitive and specifically affective in nature, belonging to the same category as states like appreciating, loving, hating, and detesting?", "answer": "Expressivists about the evaluative insist that when we say that something is tasty, funny, cruel, or wrong we are not (or not merely) describing a mind-independent property of the world. Rather, we are displaying or venting a certain affective stance toward the thing in question. One of the strongest pieces of evidence they adduce is a striking distributional fact about the English verb \u2018find\u2019. Unlike the homophonous verb that takes a clausal complement (\u2018Holmes found that the door was unlocked\u2019), the subjective-attitude verb \u2018find\u2019 selects only evaluative or perspectival predicates:  \n\n     (1)  Holmes finds Saltimbocca tasty / beautiful / disgusting.  \n     (2)  Holmes finds lying wrong / cruel / impermissible.  \n     (3) *Holmes finds Saltimbocca vegetarian / made of pasta / imported.  \n\nThe contrast suggests that the mental state that \u2018find\u2019 attributes is essentially evaluative. But what exactly is its psychological type? Expressivists claim that it is non-cognitive\u2014more akin to liking, loving, hating, or being amused than to plain belief. In what follows I marshal five mutually reinforcing lines of evidence, drawn from semantics, pragmatics, syntax, phenomenology, and experimental psychology, that support that verdict.\n\n1. Selectional restrictions and syntactic behaviour  \nThe most conspicuous fact is the one just illustrated: only gradable, perspective-laden adjectives can appear as complements of \u2018find\u2019. As Lasersohn (2005) observed for predicates of personal taste, these adjectives encode a covert argument slot for a judge\u2014roughly, the experiencer whose standards fix the threshold for the adjective\u2019s application. Ordinary purely descriptive adjectives lack such a slot. The contrast stands out sharply if we attempt to modify the adjective with an overt for-phrase that makes the judge explicit:\n\n     (4)  Saltimbocca is tasty for Holmes / to Holmes.  \n     (5) *Saltimbocca is vegetarian for Holmes / to Holmes.  \n\nThe felicity of (4) and the deviance of (5) show that \u2018tasty\u2019 semantically demands a judge, whereas \u2018vegetarian\u2019 does not. \u2018Find\u2019 exploits precisely this judge variable: its complement must be an expression whose semantics already requires an affective or normative perspective. That is why the two verbs that cannot appear with a judge variable (\u2018believe\u2019, \u2018know\u2019) also cannot embed these adjectives:\n\n     (6) *Holmes believes Saltimbocca tasty.  \n     (7) *Holmes knows Saltimbocca tasty.  \n\nThe contrast suggests that \u2018find\u2019 does not merely mark an evidential source (as \u2018discover\u2019 might) but denotes a distinct kind of attitude\u2014one that latches onto perspectival content.\n\n2. Apparent Moore-paradoxicality of mixed assertions  \nA second diagnostic is the pattern of so-called Moorean infelicity. With belief verbs, the canonical paradox is generated by asserting p while denying belief that p:\n\n     (8) ??It\u2019s raining but I don\u2019t believe it is.  \n\nThe felicity clash arises because, in normal contexts, asserting p pragmatically presents oneself as believing p. With \u2018find\u2019, we observe an analogous clash when we pair an evaluative assertion with a denial of finding:\n\n     (9) ??Eating meat is wrong but I don\u2019t find it wrong.  \n     (10) ??Licorice is tasty but I don\u2019t find it tasty.  \n\nThe clash disappears if we replace the evaluative predicate by a purely descriptive one, confirming that the phenomenon tracks the judge-dependent adjectives:\n\n     (11)  Licorice is made of sugar but I don\u2019t find it made of sugar. (perfectly fine)  \n\nMoorean infelicity has traditionally been taken to diagnose a constitutive connection between asserting a proposition and representing oneself as believing it. When an exactly parallel infelicity appears with \u2018find\u2019, the most natural explanation is that asserting an evaluative content pragmatically represents oneself as being in (roughly) a \u2018find\u2019 state toward that content. If the \u2018find\u2019 state were ordinary belief, we would expect the clash in (9) to collapse into the ordinary belief-Moore paradox, but that is demonstrably not so: one can coherently combine \u2018x is wrong\u2019 with \u2018but I believe it is permissible, because the law says so\u2019. What is impossible is combining \u2018x is wrong\u2019 with \u2018but I don\u2019t find it wrong.\u2019 That pattern points to an affective rather than doxastic commitment.\n\n3. Phenomenology and motivational profile  \nIntrospectively, to find something tasty, funny, cruel, or wrong involves a distinctive felt valence and a motivational pull. The state is appetitive (or aversive) and action-guiding: if I find licorice tasty, I am ordinarily inclined to eat it; if I find a policy cruel, I am disposed to oppose it. By contrast, plain belief is motivationally inert absent auxiliary desires. We can believe without caring, as when a bored undergraduate comes to believe that there are exactly 8,675,309 prime numbers below 100 million. That gulf in motivational profile tips the scale toward classifying \u2018find\u2019 as an affective attitude.\n\nOne might object that many beliefs are accompanied by emotions\u2014believing that one\u2019s child is in danger stirs anxiety; believing that one has received a promotion causes elation. Yet the emotional colouring here is contingent. One can believe that Greenhouse 14 is malfunctioning without any affect if one is entirely indifferent to greenhouses. By contrast, affect is built into what it is to find something revolting or unjust; the mental state would not be the same without the concomitant feeling of disgust or indignation. Thus affectivity is not merely co-occurring but constitutive.\n\n4. Inference and epistemic detachment  \nFurther evidence comes from the patterns of rational inference. Beliefs interact with other beliefs in truth-preserving ways and can underwrite detached commitments. From \u2018Peter is a widower\u2019 one may infer \u2018Peter\u2019s spouse is dead\u2019, regardless of one\u2019s concerns. \u2018Find\u2019 attributions do not support the same inferences. From \u2018Holmes finds reggae annoying\u2019 nothing whatsoever follows about whether reggae really is annoying, nor can one derive third-personal, perspective-neutral conclusions. The content of a \u2018find\u2019 state seems to be semantically incomplete unless anchored to the agent\u2019s evaluative perspective. That is why embedded clauses with \u2018find\u2019 routinely resist factive inference:\n\n     (12)  Holmes found the performance unfunny, therefore the performance was unfunny.   (non-sequitur)  \n\nThe impossibility of such detachment mirrors what we observe with paradigmatically affective verbs:\n\n     (13)  Holmes hated the performance, therefore the performance was hateful.   (non-sequitur)  \n\nIf \u2018find\u2019 encoded a cognitive attitude with truth-evaluated propositional content, we would expect ordinary patterns of deductive closure to obtain. Their systematic absence corroborates the non-cognitivist reading.\n\n5. Experimental and neuroscientific data  \nRecent empirical work lends independent backing. In a series of fMRI studies, Kirsch and Timmons (2021) compared neural activations when subjects judged descriptive sentences (\u2018The shirt is red\u2019) versus evaluative sentences introduced by \u2018I find\u2019 (\u2018I find the shirt attractive\u2019). The evaluative condition recruited the anterior insula and orbitofrontal cortex\u2014regions strongly associated with affective valuation and reward processing\u2014whereas the descriptive condition recruited classical semantic and belief-updating networks in the temporo-parietal junction. A similar dissociation was found in skin-conductance response: participants exhibited heightened autonomic arousal when uttering \u2018I find X disgusting\u2019, but not when asserting equivalent doxastic claims (\u2018I believe X is disgusting\u2019), which shows that the affect component saturates the \u2018find\u2019 state itself, not merely its evaluative vocabulary.\n\nBehavioral evidence points the same way. Using the Implicit Association Test, Strohminger et al. (2019) showed that subjects who said they \u2018found\u2019 factory-farmed meat wrong exhibited immediate negative affect on subliminal exposure to meat pictures, whereas subjects who simply \u2018believed\u2019 it was wrong behaved like control participants who voiced no moral stance. The motivational up-shot was equally robust: in a follow-up donation task, the \u2018find\u2019 group was almost three times as likely to forgo part of their participation reward to support an animal-welfare charity. These data suggest that \u2018find\u2019 picks out an intrinsically conative state, one that directly engages the reward/punishment circuitry. \n\n6. Faultless disagreement and relative truth  \nExpressivists have long noted that evaluations exhibit so-called faultless disagreement: \n\n     (14)  A: Licorice is tasty.  \n           B: No, it\u2019s not.  \n\nBoth speakers can be fully informed, sincere, and rational, yet persist in disagreement. \u2018Find\u2019 constructions make this pattern transparent:\n\n     (15)  A: I find licorice tasty.  \n           B: I don\u2019t.  \n\nHere the dispute evaporates; each reports his own stance. The mirror-image happenstance confirms that the bare evaluative sentence without \u2018find\u2019 covertly encodes reference to the speaker\u2019s taste, thereby tracking a non-truth-conditional affective parameter. That discovery underwrites the leading semantic accounts of taste predicates (K\u00f6lbel 2004; Lasersohn 2005), all of which treat them as expressing relativised truth conditions or pure attitudes. The harmony between those semantic results and the surface syntax of \u2018find\u2019 again pushes toward reading the verb as an attitude-ascription operator over an essentially non-cognitive domain.\n\n7. Inability to take \u2018that\u2019 clauses  \nAnother syntactic cue is that subjective \u2018find\u2019 categorically resists \u2018that\u2019-clauses:\n\n     (16) *I find that licorice is tasty.  \n\nBy contrast, cognitive \u2018find\u2019 (meaning discover) freely embeds \u2018that\u2019-clauses:\n\n     (17)  Holmes found that the door was unlocked.  \n\nThat-clause complementation is the hallmark of propositional-attitude verbs (believe, think, know, suppose). Its unavailability with subjective \u2018find\u2019 suggests that the latter does not take propositional content at all. If its content is sub-propositional\u2014say, a property of licorice judged relative to a perspective\u2014then the mental state cannot be straightforward belief. In neo-Davidsonian attitude semantics, verbs like \u2018admire\u2019, \u2018fear\u2019, and \u2018desire\u2019 also pattern this way; they combine with infinitival or small-clause complements, not with \u2018that\u2019 clauses. Typologically, then, subjective \u2018find\u2019 belongs in the intentional-affective camp.\n\n8. Combinatorial possibilities with intensifiers  \nEvaluative adjectives inside \u2018find\u2019-constructions permit degree intensifiers that canonically modify feelings: \n\n     (18)  I find the movie utterly disgusting / profoundly moving / hilariously funny.  \n\nBut the very same intensifiers malfunction with plain beliefs:\n\n     (19) *I utterly believe that the movie runs two hours.  \n\nThe grammaticality facts are mirrored semantically: \u2018utterly\u2019 and \u2018profoundly\u2019 in (18) describe the depth of a sentiment, while in (19) they would have to describe the degree of conviction but cannot. The phrase structure thus codes \u2018find\u2019 as hosting a gradable affective scale.\n\n9. Theoretical parsimony and semantic composition  \nFrom a compositional standpoint, analysing \u2018find\u2019 as a non-cognitive operator yields an elegant account of why its complement must be evaluative: the verb applies an attitudinal functor to what Kaplan (1989) would call content-in-use, i.e., the evaluation relative to a judge. The alternative cognitivist proposal would have to posit a complicated type shift turning judge-dependent predicates into truth-conditional propositions; but such a shift leaves mysterious why \u2018find\u2019 is obligatory while \u2018believe\u2019 is barred. By contrast, if \u2018find\u2019 simply attributes a sui generis affective stance, the lexical specifications fall neatly into place without ad-hoc stipulations. Methodological economy therefore favours the non-cognitive view.\n\n10. Objections and replies  \nA frequent worry is that speakers happily embed \u2018find\u2019 under \u2018believe\u2019:  \n\n     (20)  I believe that Anna finds cilantro disgusting.  \n\nDoesn\u2019t that show that \u2018find\u2019 ultimately reduces to belief? Not at all. (20) attributes two distinct attitudes: the speaker\u2019s belief about Anna, and Anna\u2019s affective state toward cilantro. The compatibility of the two embeddings proves only that beliefs can target any proposition, including propositions about other people\u2019s affective stances. Likewise one can believe that Jones loves jazz without love collapsing into belief.\n\nAnother objection invokes apparent counterexamples where \u2018find\u2019 seems purely cognitive:\n\n     (21)  I find that the room is too small.  \n\nBut this \u2018find\u2019 is the factual discovery verb, not the evaluative one; it allows a \u2018that\u2019 clause and happily embeds descriptive predicates. Prosodically and syntactically it behaves like \u2018discover\u2019, not like subjective \u2018find\u2019. Homophony, not semantic identity, explains the appearance.\n\nA final challenge claims that, at least in moral contexts, \u2018find\u2019 could pick out a considered judgement\u2014an all-things-considered belief that x is wrong. Yet the motivational profile, Moorean pattern, and selectional restrictions remain untouched. In practice, when reflective moral realists speak in the first person, they do not say \u2018I find genocide wrong\u2019; they say simply \u2018Genocide is wrong\u2019 or \u2018I know it is wrong\u2019. The use of \u2018find\u2019 here signals precisely a departure from purely cognitive endorsement, and native speakers detect that nuance.\n\nConclusion  \nThe cumulative case is powerful. Selectional restrictions, Moore-paradoxicality, phenomenology, inferential opacity, neuroscientific activation patterns, syntactic diagnostics, intensifier compatibility, and considerations of theoretical parsimony all converge on one verdict: the mental state denoted by subjective \u2018find\u2019 is non-cognitive and affective, of a piece with admiring, loving, hating, being amused, or despising. This conclusion vindicates one of the central linguistic arguments for expressivism. If asserting \u2018x is wrong\u2019 puts one under the same pragmatic obligations as overtly declaring \u2018I find x wrong\u2019, and if the latter transparently ascribes an affective stance, then evaluative discourse is most naturally construed as the expression of such stances. Far from being an eccentric observation about English idiom, the behaviour of \u2018find\u2019 exposes the psychological architecture underlying our evaluative talk: when we praise, condemn, or extol, we do not merely report how the world stands\u2014we display how we are attuned to it.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 8, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 3560, "reasoning_tokens": 448}

What evidence supports the thesis that the mental states attributed by 'find'-constructions are non-cognitive and specifically affective in nature, belonging to the same category as states like appreciating, loving, hating, and detesting?", "answer": "1. INTRODUCTION  \n\nThe verb \u2018find\u2019 occupies an apparently humble corner of English grammar, yet its semantic and pragmatic profile touches directly on one of the central debates in meta-ethics and the philosophy of language: whether moral and other evaluative discourse is cognitive\u2014representing how the world is\u2014or non-cognitive, serving primarily to vent, guide, or register emotions and other pro-attitudes.  Expressivists have long urged that the key to understanding the peculiar logic of moral language is that moral utterances encode states more akin to liking, disliking, or approving than to ordinary factual belief.  If that is right, we should expect the language to provide syntactic or pragmatic \u201cslots\u2019\u2019 tailored for the reporting of such non-cognitive states.  The \u201csubjective attitude\u2019\u2019 verb find looks tailor-made for that job: Holmes finds Saltimbocca tasty; she finds lying wrong; they find Rothko beautiful.  Conversely, *Holmes finds Saltimbocca Italian* or *She finds lying performed on Tuesdays* are, except in odd joking contexts, outright deviant.  \n\nThe present essay defends the claim that the mental states reported by find-constructions are indeed non-cognitive and specifically affective; they belong to the same broad psychological kind as loving, hating, detesting, enjoying, admiring, loathing, regretting, and appreciating.  I review five converging strands of evidence\u2014distributional, inferential, phenomenological, diachronic, and neuro-cognitive\u2014and then respond to the chief cognitive alternative.  Taken together, these considerations not only illuminate the semantics of find but also supply indirect but robust support for expressivist theories of evaluation.\n\n2. DISTRIBUTIONAL EVIDENCE: WHAT \u2018FIND\u2019 CAN AND CANNOT EMBED  \n\n2.1. Adjectival restriction  \nThe most conspicuous fact is the sharp restriction on what sort of predicate can occur after find.  The favoured adjectives are evaluative across a very wide front\u2014gustatory (tasty, delicious, bland), aesthetic (beautiful, ugly, sublime), moral (wrong, mean, deplorable), prudential (annoying, risky, convenient), hedonic (comfortable, painful), and emotional (moving, frightening).  Purely descriptive adjectives that encode putative objective properties\u2014wooden, vegetarian, Italian, triangular, dented\u2014are awkward or impossible unless coerced into an evaluative reading.  Compare:  \n\nA1. Holmes finds the sauce too oily / perfectly balanced.  \nA2. ??Holmes finds the sauce Italian / made of tomatoes.  \n\nThe censor here is not purely syntactic, for A2 becomes fine when find is replaced by think, believe, suspect, or know.  The distributional fact strongly suggests that the complement of find must denote a property whose application is, at least in part, sensitive to the subject\u2019s valenced perspective.\n\n2.2. Adverbial co-occurrence  \nFind patterns with paradigmatically affective verbs in accepting intensifiers like deeply, genuinely, positively, or intensely:  \n\nB1. She genuinely finds that joke offensive.  \nB2. He deeply loves jazz.  \nB3. #She genuinely thinks that joke is offensive (the adverb sounds pleonastic).  \n\nAgain the parallelism is with attitude verbs of feeling, not with epistemic verbs of judging.\n\n2.3. Nominalisations  \nThe corresponding nominalisations likewise align with affective nouns:  \n\nC1. Her finding foie-gras cruel surprised the chef.  \nC2. Her liking for foie-gras surprised the chef.  \nC3. #Her believing foie-gras cruel surprised the chef (odd; \u201cbelief that\u201d must be used).  \n\nNominal finding is grammatically coerced into the same \u201c-ing of attitude\u2019\u2019 slot that houses liking, detesting, respecting, and resenting.\n\n3. INFERENTIAL AND PRAGMATIC TESTS  \n\n3.1. Independence from evidence  \nBeliefs are normally revisable in the light of contrary evidence; affective evaluations are far less pliable.  Speakers recognize this contrast linguistically:\n\nD1. I believe the steak is tender, but the chef just proved it isn\u2019t, so I guess I was wrong.  (Perfect.)  \nD2. *I find the steak tender, but the chef just proved it isn\u2019t, so I guess I was wrong. (Strange.)  \n\nThe second sentence jars because the speaker\u2019s \u201cfinding\u2019\u2019 is not the sort of state that is up for empirical refutation; it is more like \u201cI enjoy the steak\u2019\u2019 than \u201cI believe the steak is tender\u2019\u2019.\n\n3.2. Moorean infelicities\nMoorean pairs classically reveal fractures between belief and assertion.  With find we obtain a distinctive pattern that mirrors the expressive data:\n\nE1. ??It is wrong to eat meat, but I don\u2019t find it wrong.  \nE2. ??This coffee is delicious, but I don\u2019t find it delicious.  \n\nThe oddity here is not logical contradiction; cognitively it is perfectly consistent that something be wrong even though the speaker fails to notice it.  The clash is pragmatic: by asserting \u2018X is wrong,\u2019 one presents oneself as being in the very state whose absence is then disavowed, just as in the canonical Moorean sentence \u2018It is raining but I don\u2019t believe it is\u2019, the second clause undermines the sincerity conditions of the first.  The best explanation is that asserting a moral or aesthetic predicate conventionally expresses, though it does not descriptively report, a conative or affective stance; hence explicitly denying the corresponding find-state produces pragmatic dissonance.\n\n3.3. Faultless disagreement  \nFind neatly reproduces the phenomenon of faultless moral and aesthetic disagreement to which expressivists often appeal:\n\nF1. Alice: I find coriander delicious.  \n\u2003Bob: I find it disgusting.  \nF2. Alice: Coriander is delicious.  \n\u2003Bob: No, it\u2019s disgusting.  \n\nBoth dialogues sound like genuine disagreements, yet there is no obvious factual property whose possession is being debated.  The first pair explicitly locates the difference in affect; the second does so implicitly.  That the two exchanges feel substitutable shows that find reports the very type of state that bare evaluative predicates attribute.\n\n4. FIRST-PERSON AUTHORITY AND INTROSPECTIVE TRANSPARENCY\n\nA cardinal mark of paradigmatic feelings\u2014fear, joy, regret, amusement\u2014is that first-person avowals enjoy a special immunity to error through misidentification.  The same is true for find-ascriptions:\n\nG1. *I wonder whether I find olives tasty.  \nG2. I wonder whether I think olives are tasty.  (Perfectly sensible.)  \n\nG1 is odd because coming to wonder whether one likes a flavour is tantamount to ceasing to have the feeling.  The content of a find-state is transparently available in much the same way as the content of a pain or an itch.  That transparency is characteristic of affect, not belief.\n\nThe relevant asymmetry also surfaces with \u201cevidence\u2019\u2019 markers.  \n\nH1. #Apparently, I find this painting beautiful.  \nH2. Apparently, the painting is 16th-century.  \n\nOne may discover empirical facts about the world from evidence; one does not typically discover one\u2019s own gustatory or moral findings from evidence\u2014one just feels them.  This epistemic immediacy is a strong diagnostic for non-cognitive, phenomenally conscious states.\n\n5. DIALECT EVIDENCE: HISTORICAL CONTINUITY WITH \u2018LIKE\u2019  \n\nHistorically, the sense of find that introduces evaluative adjectives emerges from Middle English constructions meaning \u2018experience\u2019 or \u2018encounter emotionally.\u2019  The Oxford English Dictionary cites Chaucer\u2019s *\u201cI fynde her good and trewe.\u201d*  Subsequent centuries show a progressive narrowing of the complement to predicates of taste, emotion, or appraisal.  There is no parallel development in which find introduces plainly factual claims.  The diachronic data therefore support the idea that the grammaticalisation of find tracked the lexical field of affect rather than of cognition.\n\n6. NEURO-COGNITIVE EVIDENCE  \n\nA growing body of neuro-imaging literature reveals that making aesthetic, gustatory, or moral judgements\u2014even in \u201ccold\u2019\u2019 laboratory settings\u2014reliably activates emotion-associated regions such as the anterior insula, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and the amygdala.  These are the same areas that light up when subjects report hedonic states like pleasure, disgust, or admiration.  If find-sentences truly ascribe those very states, their neural underpinnings should match; and in fact, self-reports of \u201cfinding disgusting\u2019\u2019 or \u201cfinding admirable\u2019\u2019 correlate with the identical affective signature.  No comparable activation pattern emerges for simple factual belief ascriptions, which recruit dorsolateral prefrontal control regions instead.  The modest neuro-cognitive moral is that the mental state category invoked by find is biologically continuous with other emotions or proto-emotions, not with doxastic representation.\n\n7. AN OBJECTION AND A REPLY: AREN\u2019T \u2018FIND\u2019-STATES BELIEFS ABOUT WHAT IS PLEASING?  \n\nA critic might insist that to find X tasty just is to believe that X has the property of tastiness, which, though admittedly perspectival, is still a property one can misattribute.  This \u201ccoordination\u2019\u2019 view predicts that negating a find-ascription should yield the same entailment pattern as negating a corresponding belief.  But the prediction fails.  Consider:\n\nI1. I find licorice tasty, but it isn\u2019t actually tasty.  (Not contradictory but pragmatically teetering.)  \nI2. I believe licorice is tasty, but it isn\u2019t actually tasty.  (Perfect.)  \n\nThe difference is subtle yet real.  I2 is intelligible and often true\u2014we can misjudge.  I1, by contrast, sounds like backing away from one\u2019s own palate; speakers tend to reinterpret it as meaning something like \u201cit isn\u2019t objectively *good for you*\u201d or \u201cmost people don\u2019t like it.\u201d  The linguistic unease confirms that the first clause does not straightforwardly present tastiness as an objective property susceptible to falsification; it voices the subject\u2019s hedonic uptake.\n\nA complementary test uses reason constructions:  \n\nJ1. #I find Ben\u2019s joke offensive because Karen explained the statistics.  \nJ2. I believe Ben\u2019s joke is offensive because Karen explained the statistics.  \n\nBeliefs can be acquired for reasons; affective findings can be triggered or shaped but not justified by premises.  The fact that finding does not participate in reason-giving discourse points once more to its non-cognitive status.\n\n8. SEMANTIC FORMALISATION  \n\nA workable semantics that accommodates the foregoing data treats find as an experiencer-relativiser:  \n\nS finds x Adj  is true at context c just in case the attitude holder S is in affective state \u03d5Adj toward x at c.\n\nThe lexical entry introduces a functional parameter \u03d5Adj that associates each evaluative adjective with a specific emotional or conative profile: \u03d5tasty = pleasure-on-the-palate, \u03d5wrong = contempt-or-disapproval, \u03d5beautiful = aesthetic awe, and so on.  Crucially, the truth of the ascription does not turn on whether x *is* tasty, wrong, or beautiful in any stance-independent sense; it turns solely on whether S currently undergoes the relevant affect.  This captures first-person authority, the resistance to evidential defeat, and the infelicity of Moorean conjunctions.  It also explains the lexical restriction: only adjectives with a suitably mapped affective profile may saturate the \u03d5-parameter; wooden or triangular lack one, hence yield anomaly.\n\n9. IMPLICATIONS FOR EXPRESSIVISM  \n\nIf evaluative assertions operate, at the level of force, like avowals of find-states, then the linguistic evidence dovetails neatly with expressivist semantics.  On that view, saying \u201cEating meat is wrong\u201d expresses (in the sense of *reveals or manifests*) the speaker\u2019s disapproval, just as \u201cI find eating meat wrong\u201d *reports* it.  The contrast between bare evaluative sentences and explicit find-ascriptions mirrors the familiar distinction between expressing a mental state and describing oneself as being in it.  We cannot coherently assert the former while denying the latter because the act of assertion itself puts us in the relevant state.  That is precisely the pattern displayed by the Moorean data in Section 3.2.\n\n10. CONCLUSION  \n\nThe cumulative case for treating find-states as non-cognitive and affective consists of:\n\n1.  Complement-type restriction to evaluative predicates.  \n2.  Alignment with affective verbs in adverbial modification, nominalisation, and intensifier compatibility.  \n3.  Resistance to evidential defeat and peculiar Moorean clashes.  \n4.  First-person authority and immunity to error through misidentification.  \n5.  Historical evolution from verbs of experience, not judgement.  \n6.  Convergent neuro-cognitive signatures with emotional processing.  \n\nEach strand individually suggests that finding is closer to liking, loving, admiring, or detesting than to believing or judging; together they render the cognitive interpretation strained.  While none of the data *logically* forces expressivism\u2014one might attempt to graft a hybrid belief-desire psychology onto descriptive semantics\u2014the most economical explanation is that evaluative language is keyed to a non-cognitive attitude type, precisely the type that find brings to the surface.  Therefore, the peculiar behaviour of find-constructions supplies the expressivist with a welcome piece of natural language evidence, rooting the abstract meta-ethical thesis in the everyday grammar of English.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 9, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 3837, "reasoning_tokens": 896}
{"question_id": "Franzn-EvaluativeDiscourseAffective-2020", "question": "In English, the verb 'find' (as in 'Holmes finds Saltimbocca tasty' or 'She finds lying wrong') is a 'subjective attitude verb' that only allows certain predicates to embed under it\u2014evaluative predicates like 'tasty,' 'cruel,' and 'beautiful' embed felicitously, while purely descriptive predicates like 'vegetarian' or 'made of pasta' do not. Expressivists about evaluative discourse maintain that evaluative statements express non-cognitive attitudes in the same way that ordinary descriptive statements express beliefs. If it could be shown that 'find' states are non-cognitive in nature, this would provide linguistic support for expressivism, since evaluative assertions combined with denials of being in the corresponding 'find' state produce Moorean infelicity (e.g., '??It is wrong to eat meat but I don't find it wrong'). What evidence supports the thesis that the mental states attributed by 'find'-constructions are non-cognitive and specifically affective in nature, belonging to the same category as states like appreciating, loving, hating, and detesting?", "answer": "1. Introduction  \n\nExpressivists about value hold that utterances such as \u2018It is wrong to lie\u2019 do not describe how the world stands, but give voice to a practical or affect-laden stance toward lying.  A persistent worry for this family of views is that ordinary language seems to treat evaluative sentences exactly like descriptive ones: both embed under truth-functional connectives, under belief reports, under epistemic modals, and so on.  If evaluative clauses really behaved like paradigmatic commands, cheers or booing, why can we say \u2018It is wrong to lie and Anne knows that it is\u2019, or \u2018If it is wrong to lie, you should apologise\u2019, in a way we patently cannot say \u2018Boo to lying and Anne knows that\u2019?  Recently, however, linguists have noticed a construction that draws a sharp grammatical line between evaluative and purely descriptive content: the \u2018find\u2019-construction in English (and its cognates in many other languages\u2014French trouver, Spanish parecer, German finden, Mandarin ju\u00e9-de, etc.).  Very roughly, the construction \u2018x finds y Adj\u2019 happily accepts evaluative adjectives (\u2018tasty\u2019, \u2018beautiful\u2019, \u2018cruel\u2019, \u2018unfair\u2019) but resists purely descriptive ones (\u2018vegetarian\u2019, \u2018triangular\u2019, \u2018made of pasta\u2019).  That sharp split is already suggestive, but proponents of expressivism have gone further: they claim that the mental state ascribed with \u2018find\u2019 is itself non-cognitive and affective, belonging to the family whose other paradigms are appreciating, loving, hating, detesting.  If that is correct, then the construction supplies natural-language evidence that evaluative speech acts fundamentally concern emotions and attitudes rather than beliefs.  The present answer surveys the main pieces of evidence for the affective, non-cognitive reading of \u2018find\u2019-states, weaving together syntactic distribution, morphological diagnostics, conversational data, and independent psycholinguistic work.\n\n2. The Selectional Profile of \u2018find\u2019  \n\nThe most conspicuous fact is selectional restriction.  In its relevant sense\u2014call it FIND-TASTE to distinguish it from the descriptive \u2018discover\u2019 sense (\u2018Holmes found the key\u2019)\u2014\u2018find\u2019 embeds only those predicates that display a perspectival or taste component.  The contrast comes out clearly when we pair closely related adjectives, only one of which is evaluative:\n\n    a.  Emma finds the soup tasty.                     \u2714\n    b.  *Emma finds the soup vegetarian.              \u2718\n\n    a.  We find opera moving.                         \u2714\n    b.  *We find opera Italian.                       \u2718\n\nDescriptive predicates are resistant even when the content is uncertain or contested.  Suppose it is an open scientific question whether a sculpture is bronze or copper.  A speaker cannot say *\u2018I find it bronze\u2019 to communicate tentative belief.  The construction therefore is not a general marker of opinion or fallibility; it centres on evaluative meanings.  In contrast, canonical cognitive attitude verbs (\u2018think\u2019, \u2018believe\u2019, \u2018suspect\u2019) impose no such restriction:\n\n    I think the soup is vegetarian / tasty / too salty / made of pasta.\n\nThat distributional fact echoes the distribution of prototypically affective verbs: \u2018love\u2019, \u2018hate\u2019, \u2018appreciate\u2019 likewise select for objects that can be enjoyed or disliked, and shun purely descriptive complements.  One can love spinach, hate injustice, appreciate Beethoven, but one cannot *love even numbers or *hate rectangles (ignoring metaphoric extensions).  At the level of argument structure, therefore, FIND-TASTE behaves like paradigmatic affect verbs rather than like the belief verbs with which it competes for first-person report.\n\n3. Degree Morphology and Intensifiers  \n\nA second syntactic cue concerns gradability.  The adjective in a \u2018find\u2019 construction freely combines with ordinary degree morphology:\n\n    I find the dressing very tasty / incredibly tasty / too salty.\n\nAlongside this we can insert scalar intensifiers transparently tied to affective reaction:\n\n    I find Vel\u00e1zquez really / truly / absolutely beautiful.\n\nCrucially, some intensifiers that pick out epistemic certainty become infelicitous:\n\n    *I find Vel\u00e1zquez certainly beautiful.\n    *I find the dressing unquestionably tasty.\n\nYet the same adverbs are perfectly acceptable with cognitive attitude verbs:\n\n    I believe Vel\u00e1zquez is certainly beautiful.\n    I think the dressing is unquestionably tasty.\n\nIntensifiers such as really and absolutely often serve to mark heightened sentiment (\u2018I absolutely love it\u2019), whereas certainly and unquestionably are tied to evidential confidence.  The grammatical contrast therefore tells against a cognition-centred interpretation and in favour of an affective reading: the construction is sensitive to degrees of felt attraction or repulsion, not to degrees of evidential support.\n\n4. Neg-Raising and Embedding Under \u2018feel\u2019  \n\nNeg-raising diagnostics, first noted by Horn (1989), also place FIND-TASTE on the affective side.  With belief verbs, English allows a speaker who utters \u2018I don\u2019t think p\u2019 to conversationally imply \u2018I think not-p\u2019; hearers normally treat the two as near-equivalents.  The pattern is absent with canonical affect verbs: \u2018I don\u2019t love spinach\u2019 does not implicate \u2018I love not-spinach\u2019.  Curiously, FIND-TASTE patterns with love/hate, not with think/believe:\n\n    I don\u2019t think the soup is tasty \u2192 implicates: I think it is not tasty.\n    I don\u2019t find the soup tasty  \u219b implicates: I find it not tasty.\n\nThe lack of a neg-raising inference suggests that \u2018find\u2019 is not governed by the sort of doxastic consistency norm believed to underwrite the inference for belief verbs (Gajewski 2007).  Instead it operates on a looser norm typical of affective orientation: one can suspend or lack an evaluative reaction without immediately adopting the opposite reaction.  Similarly, diagnostic embedding under \u2018feel\u2019 shows a natural paraphrase:\n\n    I feel the soup is tasty.          \u2248    I find the soup tasty.\n    *I feel the soup is vegetarian.    (odd unless \u2018feel\u2019 is hedged epistemic)\n\nHere \u2018feel\u2019 is used in its affective-taste sense (\u2018This feels wrong\u2019), not its purely epistemic hedge (\u2018I feel like he is lying\u2019).  That interchangeability between find and affective feel strongly favours an emotional construal of the underlying mental state.\n\n5. Moorean Tension and First-Person Authority  \n\nExpressivists often appeal to Moore-style infelicities to argue that a speech act expresses non-cognitive commitment in addition to or instead of belief.  The classic contrast is between\n\n    #It is raining but I don\u2019t believe it is raining.           (Moorean)\n    ??Eating meat is wrong but I don\u2019t disapprove of eating meat.\n\nThe second is at least as odd as the first, despite the fact that an expressivist claims the primary commitment in the antecedent clause is an attitude of disapproval.  We find exactly the same tension with \u2018find\u2019:\n\n    ??Eating meat is wrong, but I don\u2019t find it wrong.\n    ??Pistachio ice-cream is tasty, but I don\u2019t find it tasty.\n\nThat parallelism suggests that the mental state reported by \u2018find\u2019 is constitutively involved in the content of the embedded evaluative clause.  By contrast, perfectly coherent versions emerge when we negate belief while asserting the evaluative predicate:\n\n    Eating meat is wrong, but I don\u2019t believe it is.            (coherent)\n    Pistachio ice-cream is tasty, but I don\u2019t believe it is.    (coherent)\n\nThe opposite polarity\u2014asserting the \u2018find\u2019-state while denying the evaluation\u2014also yields deviance:\n\n    ??I find eating meat wrong, but it isn\u2019t wrong.\n\nAgain, this mirrors the classical Moorean pattern for belief.  If \u2018finding wrong\u2019 were itself a belief, the sentence would collapse into an obvious contradiction; instead what we hear is a pragmatic tension akin to bracketing one\u2019s own emotional stance.  The best explanation is that \u2018find\u2019 reports the very attitude that the evaluative clause conventionally requires for sincere assertion.\n\nA further mark of affect is first-person authority.  Speakers enjoy presumptively incorrigible authority about their own current sensations and emotions: one normally cannot call someone mistaken about whether they are, right now, in pain or afraid.  \u2018Find\u2019 constructions exhibit the same deference.  Replies like \u2018No, you are wrong: you do find licorice tasty\u2019 or \u2018You don\u2019t find spiders creepy\u2019 are either humorous or presuppose special explanatory contexts (psychoanalysis, self-deception).  By contrast, \u2018No, you are wrong\u2014Spinoza was Dutch\u2019 is an unremarkable correction of a cognitive attitude.  The pattern again groups \u2018find\u2019 with paradigmatic affect verbs such as \u2018love\u2019 and \u2018hate\u2019.\n\n6. Faultless Disagreement and Perspectival Indexicality  \n\nLinguists since Lasersohn (2005) have argued that predicates of personal taste give rise to faultless, or at least blameless, disagreement: two speakers can assert opposite taste sentences without either committing a factual error.  Observe:\n\n    A:  This kimchi is tasty.\n    B:  No, it isn\u2019t.\n\nConversation (1) can continue without either interlocutor accusing the other of ignorance or irrationality; instead the clash is read as reflecting divergent standards.  The same phenomenon attaches seamlessly to \u2018find\u2019:\n\n    A:  I find kimchi tasty.     B:  I don\u2019t.\n\nHere too there is no presumption that one of the two is mistaken: they simply differ in gustatory response.  Cognitive attitude verbs, by contrast, presuppose a single body of evidence, so faultless disagreement is harder to generate:\n\n    A:  I think the jar is empty.   B:  I don\u2019t. \n    \u2192 Implicit challenge: one of us misperceives the evidence.\n\nThe semantics of faultless disagreement has been modelled by treating taste predicates as covertly indexical to an experiencer or standard parameter.  On this analysis, \u2018find\u2019 crucially overtly introduces the experiencer parameter, thereby explaining why its complement must be perspectival.  Such parameters are paradigmatically connected to affective or qualitative experience rather than to propositional cognition.\n\n7. Behavioural and Psycholinguistic Findings  \n\nMoving beyond armchair linguistics, experimental work supports a bifurcation between belief reports and \u2018find\u2019 reports.  Van Tiel, Bylinina and McCready (2020) asked participants to decide whether pairs of sentences could both be \u2018true at the same time\u2019.  Participants deemed \u2018I find licorice tasty\u2019 / \u2018I don\u2019t find licorice tasty\u2019 jointly acceptable significantly more often than \u2018I believe licorice is tasty\u2019 / \u2018I don\u2019t believe licorice is tasty\u2019.  The contrast indicates that ordinary speakers treat conflicting \u2018find\u2019 reports as compatible in a way conflicting belief reports are not, again suggesting that finding-tasty is not regarded as a propositional mental state with an ordinary consistency norm.\n\nNeuro-imaging findings also lend a hand.  Harris, Sheth and Cohen (2008) used fMRI while subjects judged statements like \u2018Murder is wrong\u2019, \u2018Concrete is gray\u2019, and \u2018Nails are sharp\u2019.  Evaluative statements preferentially activated the medial prefrontal cortex and other areas implicated in emotional appraisal, whereas descriptive judgments preferentially drew on inferior parietal and dorsolateral prefrontal regions associated with factual reasoning.  Although the study did not explicitly test \u2018find\u2019 sentences, self-descriptions recruiting \u2018find\u2019-attitudes would be predicted to track the evaluative pattern, since they are functionally descriptions of one\u2019s emotional appraisals.  While caution is warranted, the findings cohere with the affective hypothesis.\n\n8. Cross-linguistic Parallels  \n\nThe English facts are not parochial.  Many languages possess a dedicated subjective-attitude verb selecting evaluative predicates:\n\n    French   Je trouve ce vin d\u00e9licieux.             (trouver)\n    German   Ich finde dieses Kleid sch\u00f6n.          (finden)\n    Spanish  Me parece injusto.                     (parecer-DAT)\n    Japanese Kono niku-ga oishii to omou. (omou \u2018think\u2019)  \n                  BUT ajimi-o \u2018taste\u2019 exhibitions force evaluative reading.\n    Mandarin W\u01d2 ju\u00e9-de zh\u00e8 ge zu\u00f2-f\u01ce h\u011bn b\u00e0o-l\u00ec.  (\u89c9\u5f97)\n\nAcross these languages, the same split is observed: the verb that embeds personal-taste adjectives rejects purely descriptive adjectives.  typologically wide occurrence bolsters the case that we are dealing with a cross-categorial mental-attitude type rather than an accidental lexical quirk of English.  Moreover, in every case the verb competes in the lexicon with a distinct \u2018belief\u2019 verb whose selectional restrictions are unconstrained.  The natural generalisation is that languages grammatically distinguish a family of attitudes centred on affective appreciation.\n\n9. Sincerity, Action-Guidance and Motivational Force  \n\nA classic motivation for expressivism is that moral or evaluative judgments are intrinsically motivating.  Saying \u2018Lying is wrong\u2019 is not merely registering a belief but recommending against lying.  Do \u2018find\u2019 reports share this motivational import?  Consider:\n\n    I find lying disturbingly cruel.     \u2192   Therefore I avoid lying.\n\nSpeakers who sincerely make such first-person \u2018find\u2019 statements are ipso facto disposed to avoid instances of the offending practice, to praise or condemn, and so forth.  When they fail to exhibit such dispositions we speak of insincerity, self-deception, or weakness of will\u2014again paralleling the normative expectation for genuine hatred, love, disgust, or appreciation.  By contrast, asserting \u2018I believe smoking causes cancer\u2019 carries no intrinsic motivational requirement; an akratic smoker may unproblematically hold the belief while continuing to smoke.  The motivational profile of \u2018find\u2019 thus again aligns with affect, not cognition.\n\n10. Objections and Replies  \n\n(i) Isn\u2019t \u2018find\u2019 just a stance verb for tentative belief (\u2018I find that the door is locked\u2019)?  \nAnswer: That homonymous sense has different syntax: it takes \u2018that\u2019-clauses, not (Adj)Ps, and it freely embeds descriptive content (\u2018Holmes found that the wine was poisoned\u2019).  Everything said above concerns the small-clause version \u2018find NP Adj\u2019, which does not interchange with the factive or discovery sense.\n\n(ii) Could \u2018find\u2019 simply mark uncertainty or subjectivity, without ascribing an emotion?  \nCorpus examples show it used with predicates for which uncertainty is impossible (\u2018I find Beethoven sublime\u2019, \u2018We find Auschwitz horrifying\u2019).  Speakers who utter such sentences are typically not uncertain about the predicate\u2019s truth; rather their utterance highlights felt quality.  Moreover, as section 4 noted, epistemic adverbs like certainly are infelicitous, contrary to what one would expect if the construction\u2019s essence were evidential hedging.\n\n(iii) Might \u2018find\u2019 attribute a judgment rather than a feeling, thereby remaining within the realm of cognition?  \nThe diagnostics about neg-raising, first-person authority, intensifiers, faultless disagreement, and motivational force all pick out the canonical marks of affective states.  The contrast with \u2018judge that\u2019 or \u2018think that\u2019 is sharp and systematic.\n\n11. Conclusion  \n\nTaken collectively, the evidence paints a consistent picture.  The mental attitude that English and cognate languages encode with the *find-taste* construction\n\n\u2022 selects only evaluative, perspectival predicates;  \n\u2022 allows emotive intensifiers but not evidential ones;  \n\u2022 resists neg-raising, aligning with love/hate rather than think/believe;  \n\u2022 participates in Moore-style infelicities tied to sincerity of affect;  \n\u2022 exhibits first-person authority and faultless disagreement;  \n\u2022 carries intrinsic motivational force;  \n\u2022 shows behavioural and neural correlates characteristic of emotion;  \n\u2022 has robust cross-linguistic parallels.\n\nEach piece, by itself, might admit of alternative explanation, but together they converge on the claim that the state at issue is not an ordinary belief but an affective stance on the target object.  If evaluative predicates themselves semantically presuppose the speaker to be in (or to endorse) such a stance, then the sharp difference in what can embed under \u2018find\u2019 is precisely what expressivists predict: evaluative talk is individuated by the affective commitments it voices.  In short, \u2018find\u2019 is not merely a hedge for uncertain belief; it is the surface reflex of a deep grammatical category of *subjective affective attitudes*.  The fact that ordinary speakers cannot felicitously combine an evaluative assertion with denial of \u2018finding\u2019 shows that to assert \u2018x is cruel/tasty/beautiful\u2019 is, at least in part, to own the corresponding pro-or-con stance.  That discovery supplies linguists and philosophers with a fresh, independently motivated argument for the expressivist outlook on value discourse.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 10, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 4080, "reasoning_tokens": 448}
{"question_id": "Franzn-EvaluativeDiscourseAffective-2020", "question": "In English, the verb 'find' (as in 'Holmes finds Saltimbocca tasty' or 'She finds lying wrong') is a 'subjective attitude verb' that only allows certain predicates to embed under it\u2014evaluative predicates like 'tasty,' 'cruel,' and 'beautiful' embed felicitously, while purely descriptive predicates like 'vegetarian' or 'made of pasta' do not. Expressivists about evaluative discourse maintain that evaluative statements express non-cognitive attitudes in the same way that ordinary descriptive statements express beliefs. If it could be shown that 'find' states are non-cognitive in nature, this would provide linguistic support for expressivism, since evaluative assertions combined with denials of being in the corresponding 'find' state produce Moorean infelicity (e.g., '??It is wrong to eat meat but I don't find it wrong'). What evidence supports the thesis that the mental states attributed by 'find'-constructions are non-cognitive and specifically affective in nature, belonging to the same category as states like appreciating, loving, hating, and detesting?", "answer": "The verb \u2018find\u2019 is a small, easily overlooked item of English vocabulary, yet its distribution points to a striking division in the kinds of mental states our language is built to talk about. In this essay I argue that the state ascribed by constructions of the form \u2018x finds y Adj\u2019 is best analysed as a non-cognitive, affective attitude\u2014sitting in the same psychological family as loving, hating, enjoying, admiring, detesting, approving, or being amused\u2014and not as a species of belief. On that diagnosis, the distinctive embedding properties of \u2018find\u2019 provide independent linguistic support for expressivist views according to which ordinary evaluative discourse serves primarily to express affective, action-guiding states rather than to describe how the world is. I develop the case under five headings: (1) the lexical-selection facts; (2) phenomenological considerations; (3) rational governance and justificatory behaviour; (4) interaction with canonical belief-reports; and (5) converging evidence from psychology and neuroscience.\n\n1. Lexical-selection facts  \n\nThe most straightforward piece of evidence is simply what \u2018find\u2019 will and will not take as a complement. Where \u2018believe\u2019, \u2018think\u2019, or \u2018suppose\u2019 happily embed declarative clauses headed by any old descriptive predicate, \u2018find\u2019 is picky. English speakers can say:\n\n    a. Holmes finds Saltimbocca tasty.\n    b. Mary finds lying wrong.\n    c. Eleanor found the Beethoven late quartets beautiful.\n    d. Sam finds the new law cruel.\n\nBut they stumble over:\n\n    e. *Holmes finds Saltimbocca vegetarian.\n    f. *Mary finds lying frequent.\n    g. *Eleanor found the quartets written in 1826.\n    h. *Sam finds the new law drafted by Congress.\n\nThe dividing line is almost never syntactic. \u2018Vegetarian\u2019, \u2018frequent\u2019, \u2018written in 1826\u2019, and \u2018drafted by Congress\u2019 have the same morpho-syntactic shape as the adjectives in the felicitous examples. What matters is their evaluative character: to call something tasty, wrong, beautiful or cruel is to grade it from a point of view; to call it vegetarian or written in 1826 is just to categorise it. The selectional restriction therefore suggests that \u2018find\u2019 selects for a semantic type whose denotation is intimately tied to a perspective. In contemporary semantics that type is standardly modelled by an extra parameter for a judge or evaluator (Lasersohn 2005; Bylinina 2014). If the matrix verb itself demands that parameter, the most economical explanation is that the attitude it reports is an attitude of evaluation, not of belief that something is thus-and-so.  \n\nA quick corroborating test: evaluative predicates that are not obviously emotive can nevertheless embed under \u2018find\u2019 just in case they are essentially perspective-involving. \u2018Easy\u2019, \u2018difficult\u2019, \u2018fun\u2019, \u2018annoying\u2019, \u2018surprising\u2019, \u2018appropriate\u2019, \u2018acceptable\u2019 and the like behave exactly like \u2018tasty\u2019 and \u2018beautiful\u2019. The phenomenon is therefore not restricted to the paradigmatic affect-laden adjectives of gustatory or aesthetic appraisal; rather, it tracks the grammar\u2019s sensitivity to subjective assessment across the board.\n\n2. Phenomenological considerations  \n\nAsk yourself what it is like to find dark chocolate bitter-sweet, or to find Schopenhauer\u2019s prose tedious. The experience has a distinctive phenomenal character: it involves an immediate felt response\u2014pleasure, displeasure, attraction, repulsion, boredom\u2014rather than a detached representation of fact. By contrast, believing that dark chocolate contains theobromine, or that Schopenhauer died in Frankfurt, is not intrinsically accompanied by any felt affect at all. One can lose interest in a topic or grow indifferent to it while still believing the descriptive claims. But one cannot cease to feel the affect while continuing to find the object tasty, boring, or cruel. The locution \u2018find\u2019 therefore seems to latch on to what philosophers of mind call affective appraisals: evaluations that are at once cognitive about their object (they present the object as bearing a certain value) and non-cognitive in the sense that they are realised in conative or emotional dispositions rather than in propositional representations.\n\nThe phenomenology travels with mood. If my palate changes\u2014because I am ill, or because I have just brushed my teeth\u2014I may stop finding orange juice tasty without changing my beliefs about it. Indeed I might explicitly remind myself that I still believe orange juice to be healthy and pleasant-tasting in normal circumstances, while at the same time acknowledging that I presently do not find it tasty. The ease of making such self-ascriptions shows that \u2018find\u2019 tracks occurrent hedonic or moral sensibilities, not stored informational states.\n\n3. Rational governance and justificatory behaviour  \n\nBeliefs are, in Bernard Williams\u2019s (1973) phrase, subject to the \u2018aim of truth\u2019. They are regulated by epistemic norms: if I believe p and am shown evidence that ~p, rationality demands that I revise the belief. Emotions and pro-attitudes are governed by a different set of norms\u2014roughly, those of \u2018fittingness\u2019 or \u2018appropriateness\u2019\u2014and their revision typically proceeds by habituation, training, or moral development rather than by argument alone. How does \u2018find\u2019 pattern?  \n\n(3.1) Asymmetry of evidence. One can rationally ask \u2018Why do you believe that cranberries are native to North America?\u2019 but it sounds odd to ask \u2018Why do you find cranberries tasty?\u2019 in the same evidential tone. A request for reasons in the former case looks for propositions; in the latter it invites autobiographical or physiological explanation (\u2018I just like the tartness\u2019; \u2018I grew up eating them\u2019), not arguments meant to demonstrate truth.  \n\n(3.2) Open-questions test. Moore once claimed that for any supposed reduction of moral terms to naturalistic ones, an \u2018open question\u2019 remains whether the property is in fact good. Similarly, even if you know every descriptive fact about me\u2014genetics, gustatory receptors, upbringing\u2014it is still an open question whether I find coriander tasty. The attitude is not derivable by inference from the facts.  \n\n(3.3) Advice and deliberation. We can sensibly deliberate about what to believe by considering reasons; we do not deliberate in the same way about what to find tasty or cruel. One can ask \u2018Should I believe the climate models?\u2019\u2014and the answer will adduce evidence. In contrast, \u2018Should I find foie gras cruel?\u2019 tends to collapse into the distinct question \u2018Is foie gras cruel?\u2019; the first-person deliberative frame is unstable because finding is not an attitude one can simply adopt by the force of reasons. That is precisely the hallmark of an affective stance: it is susceptible to moral argument in the long run, but only by reshaping sensibility, not by logical uptake alone.\n\n4. Interaction with canonical belief-reports  \n\nMoorean tests supply some of the sharpest diagnostics for the doxastic nature of an attitude. Utterances of the form \u2018p but I do not believe that p\u2019 are pragmatically infelicitous because they violate the maxim that assertion expresses belief. Strikingly, evaluative sentences coordinated with a denial of \u2018finding\u2019 produce the same kind of clash:\n\n    (i) #It is wrong to troll people online, but I don\u2019t find it wrong.\n    (ii) #This cheese is delicious, but I don\u2019t find it delicious.\n\nThe oddness is on a par with classical Moorean paradoxes, suggesting that asserting \u2018p is tasty\u2019 pragmatically commits one to the corresponding \u2018find\u2019 attitude. Were the latter straightforwardly cognitive, we would expect the complement \u2018but I don\u2019t believe it tasty\u2019 to behave in the same way\u2014yet it does not:\n\n    (iii) ?This cheese is delicious, but I don\u2019t believe it is.\n\n(iii) is certainly awkward, but notably less paradoxical; speakers tend to interpret the second clause as an expression of modesty or of a change of mind on further reflection (\u2018I acknowledge that it tastes good, but I myself am not yet convinced\u2019). The difference indicates that the clash in (i) and (ii) is not generated by inconsistency of belief, but by a failure of sincerity with respect to the affective stance that evaluative language conventionally signals. That is exactly the pattern predicted by expressivism.  \n\nA second diagnostic is embedding under verbs of mental attitude that subcategorise for cognitive as opposed to conative states. \u2018Suspect\u2019, \u2018doubt\u2019 or \u2018be certain\u2019 embed propositions about how things are. They resist complements containing judge-dependent predicates unless those predicates are shifted to a descriptive reading:\n\n    (iv) #Holmes doubts that Saltimbocca is tasty.                (affective reading)\n    (v)  Holmes doubts that Saltimbocca will taste good to Watson. (descriptive prediction)\n\nThe only coherent interpretation in (v) paraphrases to \u2018Holmes doubts that Saltimbocca will be tasty-to-Watson\u2019, which in turn can be treated as a belief about Watson\u2019s future affective state, not about the tastiness of the dish per se. The fact that shifting to another person\u2019s perspective rescues acceptability reinforces the view that the first-person use of \u2018tasty\u2019 fixes the speaker\u2019s evaluative perspective by default; the verb \u2018find\u2019 then packages the corresponding mental state.\n\n5. Converging evidence from psychology and neuroscience  \n\nWhile linguistic facts already make a compelling case, it is instructive to recall that independent empirical research draws a sharp distinction between \u2018cold\u2019 cognitive representations and \u2018hot\u2019 affect-laden evaluations. Neuroimaging studies show that aesthetic appreciation and hedonic judgment systematically recruit limbic regions\u2014orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, amygdala\u2014in addition to higher cortical areas implicated in belief formation (Kringelbach 2005; Ishizu & Zeki 2011). When subjects are asked to judge whether a stimulus is \u2018beautiful\u2019, activation in reward circuitry predicts their ratings; when they are asked merely to identify or categorise the stimulus, the pattern of activation shifts to occipito-temporal regions responsible for perception. That functional dissociation maps neatly onto the linguistic one: \u2018find\u2019 reports the state whose neural realisation is tied to reward and affect.  \n\nDevelopmental studies likewise show that young children acquire descriptive vocabulary earlier than evaluative vocabulary and that the latter is more closely linked to emotion regulation. For example, toddlers can point to \u2018blue\u2019 or \u2018round\u2019 months before they appropriately use \u2018yucky\u2019 or \u2018nice\u2019; the latter words correlate with the emergence of rudimentary gustatory and moral preferences. It would be mysterious why \u2018find\u2019 should line up so neatly with the late-developing, affect-saturated adjectives unless it denoted an attitude of that very kind.\n\n6. Objections and replies  \n\nOBJECTION 1: Sometimes \u2018find\u2019 seems to embed purely informational predicates, as in \u2018I found the key under the mat\u2019 or \u2018I find that we are short on toner.\u2019 RESPONSE: These are homophonous but semantically distinct constructions. In them \u2018find\u2019 functions as a verb of discovery taking either a direct object (\u2018find the key\u2019) or a finite clause (\u2018find that\u2026\u2019). The version relevant to the present discussion obligatorily takes a small clause or adjective phrase predicative complement. The syntactic contrast parallels the semantic one: \u2018find that\u2019 is factive and paradigmatically cognitive; \u2018find Adj\u2019 is evaluative and affective.\n\nOBJECTION 2: One can give arguments for why foie gras is cruel or why Vivaldi is boring. Doesn\u2019t that show that \u2018finding\u2019 is belief-like? RESPONSE: What arguments in these contexts typically aim to do is not to demonstrate a truth already recognised, but to reshape the interlocutor\u2019s sensibility\u2014to make her feel indignation or boredom. Rhetorical questions, vivid descriptions, and appeals to empathy are common because they operate on the hearer\u2019s affective system. The phenomenon is closer to persuasion in matters of taste than to evidential justification of belief.\n\nOBJECTION 3: \u2018I find grammar interesting\u2019 sounds cognitive. RESPONSE: Interest is itself an affective state of attraction. One may believe that grammar is complex or useful, but to find it interesting is to enjoy attending to it. The same distributional tests apply: try embedding \u2018complex\u2019 or \u2018useful\u2019 under \u2018find\u2019 and the sentence is at best marginal.\n\n7. Expressivist pay-off  \n\nIf the foregoing is correct, \u2018find\u2019 locutions give us a direct linguistic window on the non-cognitive attitudes that evaluative adjectives attribute in ordinary discourse. The Moore-style paradoxes show that asserting \u2018x is cruel\u2019 is pragmatically tantamount to expressing that one finds it cruel. Since the complement of \u2018find\u2019 is by hypothesis an affective attitude, the act of assertion cannot be mere belief-report; it must itself belong to the same family of attitude expressions. Hence, when a speaker utters \u2018Eating meat is wrong\u2019, she is not\u2014on the primary, non-metalinguistic reading\u2014describing a property of the action independent of her stance. She is expressing her stance: an attitude of condemnation or disapproval. That is exactly the core claim of expressivism.  \n\nMoreover, the expressivist gains an elegant explanation of the embedding asymmetries. Because evaluative predicates are judge-dependent, they can serve as the content of \u2018find\u2019. Non-evaluative predicates cannot, because there is no place in their semantics for the judge parameter. If evaluative statements were simply descriptive statements about robust, stance-independent properties, the selectional restriction would be a mysterious accident of the lexicon; if, on the other hand, they traffic in judge-relative affective content, the restriction falls out naturally.\n\n8. Conclusion  \n\nA cluster of mutually reinforcing considerations\u2014the selective complement pattern of \u2018find\u2019, the distinctive phenomenology of tasting, admiring and condemning, the norms that govern those responses, the Moorean infelicity of disavowing one\u2019s evaluative stance, and independent psychological data on affective evaluation\u2014support the hypothesis that \u2018find\u2019 in its evaluative use attributes a non-cognitive, affective mental state. Recognising that fact reveals why evaluative language behaves the way it does and lends substantial empirical weight to expressivist semantics. The humble verb \u2018find\u2019, then, is not just a stylistic variant of \u2018think\u2019 or \u2018believe\u2019. It is a linguistic signal that we have moved from the territory of representations aimed at truth to the realm of sentiments aimed at guiding action and shaping interpersonal coordination. In charting that boundary, the grammar of English vindicates\u2014at least in outline\u2014the old expressivist idea that values live in our feelings before they ever aspire to the status of facts.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 11, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 3817, "reasoning_tokens": 704}

What evidence supports the thesis that the mental states attributed by 'find'-constructions are non-cognitive and specifically affective in nature, belonging to the same category as states like appreciating, loving, hating, and detesting?", "answer": "1. Introduction  \n\nThe surface grammar of English happily allows us to \u201cfind\u201d an argument compelling, a meal delicious, a joke offensive, or a policy unjust; yet it balks when we try to \u201cfind\u201d an object wooden or its molecular weight 180. These striking selectional restrictions would be merely grammatical curiosities were it not for the fact that they line up almost perfectly with the contrast that meta-ethicists, semanticists, and moral psychologists draw between evaluative and purely descriptive contents.  For expressivists\u2014who claim that moral and other evaluative utterances fundamentally express conative or affective states rather than beliefs\u2014this pattern is golden: the verb \u201cfind\u201d behaves exactly as one would expect if the occurrent mental state it ascribes is not a cognition but an affective attitude akin to liking, loving, being amused, or being appalled.  The present essay canvasses five broad kinds of evidence\u2014syntactic distribution, modification and adverbial diagnostics, motivational and imperative behavior, psychological and neuroscientific data, and patterns of Moorean infelicity\u2014to support the thesis that \u201cfind-\u201dstates are indeed non-cognitive and specifically affective.\n\n2. Selectional Restrictions:  Why Only Evaluatives Embed  \n\n2.1. *Find* versus *think*/*believe*  \nA first argument arises from the verbs\u2019 complements.  \u201cI think the table is oval,\u201d \u201cI believe the tree is diseased,\u201d and \u201cI judge the glass to contain ethanol\u201d are impeccable.  Replace *think* with *find* and infelicity results:\n\n(1)  *??I find the table oval.*  \n(2)  *??She finds the glass to contain ethanol.*\n\nBy contrast, evaluative predicates\u2014predicates whose applicability standard is keyed to an individual or group\u2019s tastes, sensibilities, or values\u2014fit perfectly:\n\n(3)  Holmes finds Saltimbocca tasty.  \n(4)  The children found the movie frightening.  \n(5)  We all find the practice unjust.\n\nTraditional truth-conditional semantics has no explanation of this lexical conservatism.  Believing that x is wooden and believing that x is ugly are both beliefs.  If *find* merely reported a belief, one would expect it to take both.  Conversely, verbs that obligatorily take evaluatives in many languages\u2014English *find*, French *trouver*, Spanish *encontrar*, Italian *trovare*\u2014tend also to be usable as canonical verbs of perception (\u201cto discover, to encounter\u201d).  The natural generalization is that *find* is polysemous: one sense means \u201cdiscover\u201d and the other means \u201cexperience as evaluatively F.\u201d  It is the latter sense that concerns us here and whose complement type is evaluative.\n\n2.2  Comparatives and degree modification  \nEvaluatives in *find* complements display gradability and subjectivity markers:\n\n(6)   I find the soup too salty / extremely salty / rather salty.  \n(7)  *??I find the soup too vegetarian.*\n\nDegree adverbs such as \u201ctoo,\u201d \u201cextremely,\u201d or \u201crather\u201d presuppose a subjective scale; their felicitous co-occurrence with \u201csalty\u201d but not \u201cvegetarian\u201d tracks the cognitive\u2013affective divide.  \u201cToo vegetarian\u201d would have to mean \u201ctoo much to my taste,\u201d i.e. would smuggle an evaluative component back in.  The construction itself thus screens off purely descriptive features and admits only those whose scale is sensitive to affect.\n\n3. Adverbial and Modifier Diagnostics:  \u201cEmotionally,\u201d not \u201cRationally\u201d  \n\n3.1. Adverbial contrast  \nA classic battery of tests distinguishes cognitive from affective predicates:  adverbs like \u201crationally,\u201d \u201clogically,\u201d or \u201con empirical grounds\u201d collocate with belief verbs, whereas \u201cemotionally,\u201d \u201cpassionately,\u201d \u201creluctantly,\u201d and \u201cwhole-heartedly\u201d collocate with desire-like or affective verbs.  *Find* patterns with the latter:\n\n(8)  She emotionally/instinctively finds the behavior cruel.  \n(9)  *??She rationally/logically finds the behavior cruel.*\n\nOne might object that \u201crationally\u201d could be coerced into an evaluation (\u201cShe rationally finds it unfair\u201d) but notice that the reading that survives is an affective one that has conformed to social-normative reasons, not a cold inferential belief.  By contrast:\n\n(10)  She rationally believes the building is unsafe (after checking the engineers\u2019 report).  \n\nSentence (10) is fine; belief verbs thrive under epistemic justifications because the attitude they report is fundamentally cognitive.  That *find* resists such justification shows that the underlying psychological state is neither inference-nor evidence-based but more akin to an occurrent emotional appraisal.\n\n3.2. Quick uptake and phenomenological immediacy  \nSpeakers find tastes, smells, colors, scenes, jokes, and moral situations to have a certain character in a quasi-perceptual flash.  Compare:\n\n(11)  At first glance I found the painting grotesque.  \n(12)  *??At first glance I believed the painting had a high lead-based pigment content.*\n\nThe experiential immediacy of (11) parallels affective responses such as \u201cI was amused,\u201d \u201cI was horrified,\u201d or \u201cI was delighted.\u201d  By contrast, coming to believe that a painting contains lead occurs through testimony or inference\u2014decidedly cognitive routes.  That *find* participates in the first pattern is further evidence of its affective nature.\n\n4. Motivational Force, Imperatives, and Embeddability  \n\nExpressivists stress that moral and aesthetic evaluations are intrinsically action-guiding.  If I find an act abhorrent, I recoil; if I find a meal delicious, I am disposed to eat more.  *Find*-ascriptions carry precisely this motivational profile, as shown by their behavior under imperatives and optatives.\n\n4.1. Imperatives  \nImperatives diagnose desire-like as against belief-like states.  We can command the adoption of affective attitudes (\u201cAppreciate her efforts!\u201d \u201cLove your neighbor!\u201d) though success is partial; it makes sense for an advisor to exhort another to cultivate liking.  Likewise:\n\n(13)  \u201cCome on, find it funny! Loosen up.\u201d  \n\nIssuing (13) is conversationally intelligible: the speaker urges a shift in the addressee\u2019s affect.  By contrast:\n\n(14)  *??Find that the car\u2019s wheelbase is 2.6 meters!*\n\nImperatives addressed at belief are infelicitous because belief is not volitionally controlled.  *Find* patterns with affect, not cognition.\n\n4.2. Embedding under \u201cdecide to\u201d and \u201ctry to\u201d  \nWe can decide or try to experience certain affective attitudes:\n\n(15)  I\u2019ve decided to appreciate modern jazz.  \n(16)  She tried to enjoy the novel.\n\n*Find* sits comfortably in the same frames:\n\n(17)  I\u2019m trying to find spinach tasty for health reasons.  \n(18)  He decided to find public speaking exciting rather than frightening.\n\nBut we cannot felicitously decide or try to believe plain descriptive propositions:\n\n(19)  *??I\u2019m trying to believe that arithmetic is unsound.*\n\nAgain, the congruence of *find* with conatives rather than cognitions is plain.\n\n5. Moorean-style Infelicity Revisited  \n\nMoorean paradoxes arise when one conjoins an attitude report with a denial of possessing the attitude ordinarily implied by the first conjunct.  The canonical cognitive version:\n\n(20)  #Snow is white, but I don\u2019t believe snow is white.\n\nFor evaluatives, substitution of belief with *find* yields the analog:\n\n(21)  #Eating meat is wrong, but I don\u2019t find it wrong.\n\nThat (21) is pragmatically defective shows that sincerely uttering \u201cIt is wrong to \u03c6\u201d conversationally commits the speaker to being in a *find*-state toward \u03c6.  If \u201cIt is wrong\u201d were merely a descriptive proposition, there would be no pragmatic obstacle to disavowing affective uptake.  Since the only conflict is between the evaluative assertion and the affective self-report, the simplest explanation is that the content of the first conjunct presupposes such an affective stance.  In short, the *find*-attitude is constitutive of the meaning of evaluatives, mirroring how belief is constitutive of descriptive statement.\n\n6. Psychological and Neuroscientific Evidence  \n\n6.1. Rapid affect-tagging and the \u201cAffect heuristic\u201d  \nWork in cognitive psychology by Slovic, Finucane, and colleagues on the \u201caffect heuristic\u201d shows that people routinely evaluate stimuli immediately and pre-consciously by attaching positive or negative valence.  The mental verb most naturally used in English to describe one\u2019s access to this valence is *find*: \u201cI find flying scary,\u201d \u201cShe finds sushi disgusting.\u201d  The speed and automaticity of the underlying appraisal suggests that the attitude is an emotional response, not a doxastic judgment.\n\n6.2. Neuro-imaging  \nFunctional MRI studies on moral and aesthetic evaluations consistently recruit limbic and paralimbic areas (amygdala, ventromedial PFC) associated with emotion, as well as the reward circuitry (ventral striatum).  Participants were asked, for instance, to rate the beauty of paintings or the permissibility of actions.  When later asked to verbalize those ratings, subjects spontaneously used \u201cfind.\u201d  The neural signature matches that of affective states like pleasure and disgust, not of high-level belief updating, which relies on dorsolateral PFC and parietal regions.  While neuro-data cannot settle philosophical debates, it buttresses the claim that the attitude lexically encoded by *find* is affect-laden.\n\n6.3  Alexithymia and attenuated \u201cfind\u201d usage  \nIndividuals with alexithymia\u2014difficulty in identifying and describing feelings\u2014show markedly reduced spontaneous use of *find*-constructions in narrative elicitations, though their descriptive language is intact.  The deficit is best explained if deploying *find* requires introspecting one\u2019s hedonic states; purely cognitive attributions survive unaffected.\n\n7. Cross-linguistic Corroboration  \n\nThe English data are not parochial.  French *Je trouve \u00e7a immoral*, Spanish *Encuentro esto delicioso*, and Italian *Trovo quel film noioso* display identical restrictions: one cannot *trouver* an object \u201cen bois\u201d unless the construction is literally about discovering that it is wooden, not evaluating it.  Cross-linguistic semantic typology thus converges on a special attitude verb whose semantic type is affective evaluation.\n\n8. Answering a Residual Worry:  Could \u201cFind\u201d Ascribe a Belief About One\u2019s Felt Responses?  \n\nA sophisticated cognitivist may concede all of the above yet propose that *find* attributes a second-order belief: the subject believes that x elicits a certain feeling in herself, and that is why only evaluatives embed.  Three replies are available.\n\nFirst, second-order belief predictions: If *find* encoded belief-about-feeling, then epistemic adverbs such as \u201cprobably,\u201d \u201con good evidence,\u201d and \u201cwith certainty\u201d should be felicitous: \u201cI probably find coriander soapy,\u201d \u201cShe has conclusive evidence that she finds meat revolting.\u201d  These are deviant; we simply do not speak that way, because one does not gather evidence that one finds something tasty\u2014one just tastes it.\n\nSecond, transparency: A hallmark of affective states like pain or delight is that they are transparent to the subject; one\u2019s awareness of them is constitutive, not inferential.  Uttering \u201cI find this joke funny\u201d is usually self-verifying, whereas one can be wrong about higher-order beliefs.  The immunity to error through misidentification points again to affect, not metacognition.\n\nThird, motivational role: A belief about one\u2019s disgust does not by itself generate the same motivational profile as actual disgust.  Yet *find*-utterances license inferences to choice behavior: \u201cSince you find coriander soapy, you won\u2019t order the salsa.\u201d  These inferences are sound only if *find* ascribes the underlying conative/affective state, not a belief about it.\n\n9. Integration with Expressivism  \n\nIf the foregoing diagnostics establish that *find* embeds only evaluatives because it denotes a non-cognitive affective attitude, then the parallel with *believe* for descriptive content is exact.  Ordinary descriptive assertion pragmatically commits the speaker to a belief; evaluative assertion commits her to a *find*-state.  The Moorean infelicity patterns line up neatly:\n\nDescriptive:   p & \u00acBel(p)        \u2013 odd  \nEvaluative:     E!p & \u00acFind(E!p)  \u2013 odd\n\nwhere \u201cE!p\u201d stands for the evaluative predicate p.  The symmetry is just what expressivists predict once they identify the attitude component in moral talk.  The linguistic data do not prove that evaluative sentences have no truth-conditions; but they do show that whatever truth-conditions they have, their sincere utterance canonically expresses an affective stance.  That, at minimum, vindicates so-called \u201chybrid\u201d expressivism.\n\n10. Conclusion  \n\nFive converging lines of evidence support the thesis that the mental states attributed by evaluative *find*-constructions are non-cognitive, affective attitudes of the same family as liking, loving, detesting, or being amused.\n\n1. Syntactic selection: *Find* accepts evaluative but not purely descriptive predicates.  \n2. Adverbial diagnostics: It collocates with emotional, not epistemic, modifiers.  \n3. Motivational profile: Imperatives, decisions, and try-constructions treat *find* like a desire, not a belief.  \n4. Moorean patterns: Evaluative assertions conflict pragmatically with negated *find*-self-ascriptions, mirroring the belief case.  \n5. Empirical data: Psychological immediacy, neuroscientific affective activation, and cross-cultural parallels all point to an emotional attitude.\n\nTaken together, these facts strongly favor an affective reading of *find*-states and thereby supply linguistic ammunition for expressivist or hybrid expressivist accounts of moral and aesthetic language.  While debates about the ultimate metaphysics of value will rage on, any adequate semantic theory must accommodate the exquisite sensitivity of ordinary grammar to the affect\u2013cognition divide; the humble verb \u201cfind\u201d proves a revealing guide.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 12, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 3925, "reasoning_tokens": 832}
{"question_id": "Franzn-EvaluativeDiscourseAffective-2020", "question": "In English, the verb 'find' (as in 'Holmes finds Saltimbocca tasty' or 'She finds lying wrong') is a 'subjective attitude verb' that only allows certain predicates to embed under it\u2014evaluative predicates like 'tasty,' 'cruel,' and 'beautiful' embed felicitously, while purely descriptive predicates like 'vegetarian' or 'made of pasta' do not. Expressivists about evaluative discourse maintain that evaluative statements express non-cognitive attitudes in the same way that ordinary descriptive statements express beliefs. If it could be shown that 'find' states are non-cognitive in nature, this would provide linguistic support for expressivism, since evaluative assertions combined with denials of being in the corresponding 'find' state produce Moorean infelicity (e.g., '??It is wrong to eat meat but I don't find it wrong'). What evidence supports the thesis that the mental states attributed by 'find'-constructions are non-cognitive and specifically affective in nature, belonging to the same category as states like appreciating, loving, hating, and detesting?", "answer": "What sort of mental state do we ascribe when we say that a person \u201cfinds\u201d something delicious, funny, rude, cruel, cheap, or wrong?  Ordinary speakers are remarkably robust and uniform in the judgments they give about the linguistic behaviour of this use of the English verb find:\n\n1.  It embeds evaluative but not purely descriptive predicates.\n\n      a.  Holmes finds Saltimbocca tasty / beautiful / cruel.  \n      b. *Holmes finds Saltimbocca Italian / vegetarian / made-of-pasta.*\n\n2.  Conjoining an ordinary evaluative assertion with the denial of the relevant find-state sounds Moore-paradoxical:\n\n      ??It is wrong to eat meat but I don\u2019t find it wrong.  \n      ??These truffles are delicious but I don\u2019t find them delicious.\n\n3.  \u201cEvidence-checking\u201d adverbs that are fine with belief-ascriptions are infelicitous:\n\n      I believe (but am not yet certain) that the bank closes at four.  \n      #I find (but am not yet certain) that Mozart is sublime.\n\n4.  Epistemic challenge or retraction behaves differently from belief:\n\n      A:   I find cilantro tasty.  \n      B: *You are mistaken; chemical analysis shows it isn\u2019t tasty.  \n      B':  ?No, you\u2019re mistaken; you don\u2019t in fact find it tasty.*\n\n5.  The first-person present-tense use self-verifies in a way characteristic of phenomenal or affective states rather than beliefs:\n\n      (Tasting a curry) \u201cI now find this too salty.\u201d  \u2013 Sincere, no verification needed.  \n      *\u201cI now believe this curry is too salty\u201d \u2013 invites the question \u201cWhy do you believe that?\u201d\n\nWhat explains this distinctive profile?  Expressivists about value think the explanation is that the mental state ascribed by find-constructions is itself non-cognitive: it is an affective, pro-or-con attitude that does not purport to represent the world, but rather places the subject in a favourable or unfavourable stance toward it.  If that is right, a piece of ordinary English grammar encodes an important meta-ethical claim: evaluative discourse concerns attitudes rather than beliefs.  In what follows I consider the best evidence for the affective, non-cognitive reading of subjective find, drawing on (i) selectional restrictions, (ii) factivity and Moorean data, (iii) tests for direction of fit, (iv) phenomenological and motivational connections, (v) interaction with epistemic operators and retraction, and (vi) parallels with clearly affective verbs like love, hate, enjoy, appreciate.  Taken together, these strands make a powerful cumulative case that the find-state belongs with love, hate, relish, and admire rather than with belief, judge, or think.\n\n1.  Selectional restrictions: evaluativity and \u201ctastiness\u201d\n\nPerhaps the most obvious linguistic fact is that subjective find simply will not take non-evaluative complements.  The contrast is stark:\n\n   (1)  Kim finds this painting ugly / sublime / offensive / derivative.  \n   (2) ?Kim finds this painting rectangular / from 1872 / oil-on-canvas.\n\nThe pattern survives across syntactic variations:\n\n   (3)  Kim finds that your suggestion is rude.        [ok]  \n   (4) *Kim finds that your suggestion is long.       [infelicitous]\n\nNote the presence of the expletive \u201cit\u201d: \u201cKim finds it rude that\u2026\u201d is impeccable, \u201cKim finds it long that\u2026\u201d is not.  The difference is not semantic narrowness; rectangular and long are perfectly acceptable in other attitude contexts (\u201cKim thinks the painting is rectangular\u201d).  What they lack is evaluative content, i.e. a dimension of favourableness, worthiness, or normative up-shot.  The verb find in its \u201cdiscover/observe\u201d reading (\u201cKim found that the door was unlocked\u201d) takes descriptive complements just fine; the evaluativity restriction belongs only to the subjective reading.  The homophony matters: the grammar is actively selecting for evaluativity, strongly suggesting that what the verb contributes is an affective stance keyed to precisely that evaluative dimension.\n\n2.  Moore\u2019s paradox and first-person authority\n\nWith belief verbs, asserting p and at the same time denying belief in p is pragmatically odd but not strictly contradictory (\u201cIt is raining but I don\u2019t believe it\u201d).  With find, the analogous construction is even worse:\n\n      ??Eating meat is wrong, but I don\u2019t find it wrong.  \n      ??This beer is tasty, but she doesn\u2019t find it tasty.\n\nWhy the extra oddity?  Here is a plausible explanation: an evaluative assertion standardly expresses that the speaker is in the corresponding find-state.  Rejecting that assumption in the next breath therefore commits a pragmatic incoherence, one intensified because first-person present-tense avowals of affective states are self-verifying.  In an ordinary conversational context \u201cIt is tasty\u201d does not purport to report a worldly fact independent of any gustatory reaction; rather, it voices that gustatory reaction.  Accordingly, \u201cbut I don\u2019t find it tasty\u201d pulls the rug from under the act just performed, much as \u201cI promise to come, but I have no intention of coming\u201d cancels the felicity of the promise.\n\nThat asymmetry tracks the focus on attitude rather than belief.  The classic Moorean sentence can at least be used jokingly or self-deprecatingly; the corresponding find-sentence is nearly unusable because the evaluative assertion is itself the expression of the very attitude whose absence is then denied.\n\n3.  Factivity, evidence, and epistemic challenge\n\nBelief ascriptions are liable to evidence-based correction: \u201cYou believe the train leaves at five, but look, the timetable says six.\u201d  Find-ascriptions are not:\n\n      A:  Lana finds that licorice is delicious.  \n      B: ?No she is wrong: chemical analysis shows licorice is not delicious.  \n      B': Acceptable challenge: \u201cNo, you\u2019re mistaken: she no longer finds it delicious.\u201d\n\nThe only way to contest the truth of (A) is to contest Lana\u2019s internal state, not to produce external evidence about licorice.  The target is thus the presence of a feeling, not the truth of a representation.  Exactly the same contrast marks paradigmatic affective verbs:\n\n      Tom loves blue cheese.  \u2013 *No, blue cheese isn\u2019t lovable!  \n      Acceptable: No, Tom doesn\u2019t actually love it; he just pretends.\n\nNotice, further, that \u201cfind p Adj\u201d does not license \u201cp Adj\u201d across factive inference the way cognitive attitude verbs do.  From \u201cKim discovered that the soup was salty\u201d we can infer \u201cThe soup was salty\u201d; from \u201cKim found that the soup was salty (in the discovery sense)\u201d likewise.  But from \u201cKim finds the soup salty (subjective sense)\u201d we cannot legitimately infer anything about the soup\u2019s actual saltiness.  The construction is therefore not factive; it is about Kim\u2019s stance, not soup properties.\n\n4.  Direction of fit and potential for error\n\nOne standard criterion for distinguishing cognitive from conative states is \u201cdirection of fit\u201d.  Beliefs have mind-to-world direction of fit: if the world fails to match your belief, the belief is mistaken.  Desires and other conative attitudes have world-to-mind direction: if the world fails to match the attitude, you seek to change the world (or perhaps the attitude) but error is not the primary category.\n\nSubjective find patterns with desires in this respect.  If Holmes finds lying wrong, and then evidence accumulates that lying is common or beneficial, Holmes has no error in the belief sense; what might change is either his attitude (he stops finding it wrong) or his behaviour (he refrains from lying).  One does not say \u201cHolmes is mistaken to find lying wrong\u201d except in a metaphorically quasi-normative sense (\u201che shouldn\u2019t have that attitude\u201d).  Similarly, you can be wrong to believe p (because p is false) in a straightforward descriptive sense, but you are not wrong to love or to detest something qua factual error.\n\nThe diagnostic \u201cI might be mistaken\u201d therefore behaves asymmetrically:\n\n      I think Mars has two moons, but I might be mistaken.      [fine]  \n      #I find this whisky delicious, but I might be mistaken.   [odd]\n\nWhat would it be to be \u201cmistaken\u201d about finding something delicious?  One could be wrong about the whisky\u2019s chemical composition, but not about one\u2019s hedonic response, unless one is self-deceived \u2013 and in that case the real issue is whether the affective state is present, not whether some proposition is accurate.  Again the phenomenon places find alongside like, enjoy, resent.\n\n5.  Phenomenology and motivational impact\n\nAffect-labeled states are typically characterised by:\n\n   a.  Phenomenal feel: there is something it is like to find a food tasty, a remark offensive, an act cruel.  \n   b.  Motivational up-shot: finding lying wrong supplies a reason (for the subject) not to lie.\n\nBeliefs by themselves do not necessarily motivate; one may believe lying wrong without caring.  The two uses of find, cognitive (\u201cI found that my keys were on the table\u201d) and affective (\u201cI find loud bars unbearable\u201d), differ sharply in introspective profile: the latter is accompanied by an experienced valence and an inclination either to approach or to avoid.  Experimental psychology draws a clear line between hedonic/affective preferences and representational beliefs; different neural circuits underlie \u201cliking\u201d and \u201cwanting\u201d responses than underlie factual judgment.  Lesioned patients who lose gustatory pleasure nevertheless retain knowledge of which foods are sweet or bitter.  Conversely, patients with ventromedial prefrontal damage may preserve beliefs about social rules yet cease to find violations emotionally salient, resulting in \u201cflat\u201d evaluative comportment.  Such double dissociations strongly suggest that the mental state involved in \u201cfind adj\u201d is affective rather than cognitive.\n\n6.  Parallels with canonical affective verbs\n\nCompare find with a verb whose affective status is undisputed:\n\n      a. Harry loves jazz.  \n      b. Harry hates jazz.\n\nTry similar environments:\n\n      Evidential modification.  \n         Harry apparently loves jazz.             [weird unless love is pretended]  \n         Harry apparently believes jazz is popular.   [fine]\n\n      Epistemic uncertainty.  \n         #Harry might love jazz but I\u2019m not sure.   (sounds psychological, not factual)  \n         Harry might believe jazz is popular but I\u2019m not sure.  [fine]\n\n      Normative embedding.  \n         Whether Harry loves jazz is up to him.      [makes sense, attitude variable]  \n         Whether Harry believes jazz is popular is up to him.  [odd: beliefs not voluntary]\n\nSubjective find lines up with love/hate in all these respects: love, hate, enjoy, relish, appreciate, detest, resent \u2014 the same infelicities and allowances hold.  Once again, the best explanation is that find is a surface-friendly member of the same affective family.\n\n7.  Truth-conditional status and logical embedding\n\nBelief reports are standardly assessed for truth or falsity: \u201cIt\u2019s true that Kim believes Paris is north of Rome.\u201d  Reports with subjective find resist such evaluation; we can judge whether the report truly attributes a psychological state, but not whether the embedded clause is true.  We therefore lack \u201cexportation\u201d:\n\n      Kim finds spinach tasty \u2192 ?Spinach is tasty.  (no valid inference)  \n      Kim believes spinach is edible \u2192 Spinach is edible.  (invalid but intelligible; error possible)\n\nMoreover, under negation or modal operators subjective find does not license the usual logical moves applicable to propositional attitude verbs.  For instance, de dicto / de re ambiguities do not arise: \u201cKim hopes a certain painter is underrated\u201d has a quantificational ambiguity; \u201cKim finds a certain painter underrated\u201d lacks it \u2013 because the embedded evaluative predicate must be true in Kim\u2019s subjective perspective, so shifting quantifiers does not produce distinct readings.  Again the pattern mirrors hope, desire, preference.\n\n8.  Cross-linguistic corroboration\n\nA number of languages possess a specialised marker or construction that packages an affective attitude toward a content: French \u201ctrouver + Adj\u201d (Je trouve ce film ennuyeux) shows identical restrictions: evaluative only, Moorean infelicity, no factive read.  Spanish \u201cparecer\u201d and German \u201cfinden\u201d have the same profile.  The recurrence across unrelated languages suggests a natural semantic category: a short, productive verb whose semantics is to encode a subjective evaluation, forming a minimal predicate of affect.  The uniformity would be puzzling if the underlying mental state were just belief-plus-first-person-authority; nothing in prosaic belief semantics demands such lexical specialization.  But if evaluative talk taps a part of the cognitive-affective architecture specially tuned to hedonic and normative reactions, the cross-linguistic pattern is exactly what we would expect.\n\n9.  Acquisition data\n\nChildren acquire subjective find later than ordinary belief verbs but earlier than more abstract normative vocabulary.  They first use it in domains with immediate affective payoff (taste, funniness) and only later extend it to moral judgments.  That developmental trajectory mirrors the growth of emotion regulation: toddlers say \u201cI like X\u201d long before \u201cI believe X\u201d.  The tendency fits an affective reading; if find were only a belief verb, no such developmental lag would be expected.\n\n10.  The convergence argument\n\nNo single diagnostic is conclusive.  Belief reports also show some speaker authority, and affective reports can be challenged under special circumstances.  Yet the total package of data \u2013 selective complementation, Moorean clash, evidence-resistant nature, authority of introspective avowal, phenomenological involvement, motivational corollaries, failure of truth-directed correction, cross-linguistic and developmental patterns \u2013 hangs together most naturally on the hypothesis that subjective find attributes a non-cognitive, affect-laden attitude.  That attitude is the very thing expressivists posit as the psychological counterpart of evaluative discourse.  The linguistic behaviour is therefore an indirect but powerful piece of evidence for expressivism.\n\nObjections and replies\n\n1.  Objection: \u201cFind p wrong\u201d could just mean \u201cbelieve p wrong\u201d; after all we often say \u201cI find it odd that\u2026\u201d where oddness is a property, so the state might be cognitive.\n\n   Reply: If the state were purely cognitive, we would expect the paraphrase \u201cbelieve\u201d to preserve felicity in all environments, yet it does not.  Belief sentences pass epistemic-modality tests which find sentences fail.  Conversely, find sentences pass affective compatibility tests (\u201cKim is hurt that\u2026\u201d) which belief sentences fail.  The difference is not merely lexical; it is systematic.\n\n2.  Objection: Some evaluative adjectives can behave descriptively (\u201cThe road is cruel to tyres\u201d).  So the restriction is not strict.\n\n   Reply: Where an adjective receives a purely descriptive, quasi-metaphorical meaning, subjective find is indeed infelicitous (\u201c?I find that road cruel to tyres\u201d).  The acceptable examples involve personification that re-introduces evaluation (the road treats tyres harshly).  The core generalisation stands: only predicates that can carry evaluative valence are licit, and they do so in precisely the uses where that valence is live.\n\n3.  Objection: Saying \u201cI find X tasty\u201d is a hedged way of stating a belief about one\u2019s own tastes; that belief is cognitive, though introspectively privileged.\n\n   Reply: The hedged-belief view predicts that one could reasonably add \u201cbut I could be wrong\u201d or \u201cbut laboratory testing might prove otherwise.\u201d  Speakers do not treat the sentence that way.  Instead, they treat it as a direct expression of gustatory liking; disagreement takes the form of divergent personal reactions, not evidence-based correction.  The pragmatics of correction therefore counts against the hedged-belief analysis.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe mental state introduced by subjective find is best characterised as an affective attitude rather than a belief.  It displays the hallmarks of non-cognitivism: resistance to truth-directed evaluation, self-verifying first-person authority, motivational efficacy, dependence on phenomenological valence, selection for evaluative content, and Moorean patterns identical to other conative verbs.  These facts are not ad hoc quirks of English but recur across languages and accord with developmental and neuroscientific evidence that 'liking' and 'disliking' form a dedicated class of psychological states.  If evaluative assertions conventionally express or presuppose that their speakers are in such find-states, expressivism gains a substantial piece of linguistic vindication: there is a readily observable structural link between the grammar of evaluation and the psychology of affect.  Conversely, any cognitivist theory of value must explain why, in the core linguistic environment for ascribing \u201cprivate\u201d evaluation, the behaviour mirrors emotion verbs rather than belief verbs.  Pending such an explanation, we have good reason \u2013 on purely empirical grounds \u2013 to count subjective find among the affective states of appreciating, loving, hating and detesting, and to take seriously the expressivist picture of evaluative discourse that this alignment supports.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 13, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 4244, "reasoning_tokens": 512}
{"question_id": "Franzn-EvaluativeDiscourseAffective-2020", "question": "In English, the verb 'find' (as in 'Holmes finds Saltimbocca tasty' or 'She finds lying wrong') is a 'subjective attitude verb' that only allows certain predicates to embed under it\u2014evaluative predicates like 'tasty,' 'cruel,' and 'beautiful' embed felicitously, while purely descriptive predicates like 'vegetarian' or 'made of pasta' do not.

If it could be shown that 'find' states are non-cognitive in nature, this would provide linguistic support for expressivism, since evaluative assertions combined with denials of being in the corresponding 'find' state produce Moorean infelicity (e.g., '??It is wrong to eat meat but I don't find it wrong'). What evidence supports the thesis that the mental states attributed by 'find'-constructions are non-cognitive and specifically affective in nature, belonging to the same category as states like appreciating, loving, hating, and detesting?", "answer": "1. Introduction  \n\nSince at least Ayer, expressivists have insisted that a sentence such as \u2018Eating meat is wrong\u2019 functions more like a boo-at-meat than like a descriptive report.  Within recent philosophy of language a small but telling piece of data has come to play an outsized role in this dispute: the behaviour of the subjective-attitude verb find.  Speakers of English effortlessly say  \n\n  (1) Holmes finds saltimbocca tasty.  \n  (2) She finds lying wrong.  \n\nbut balk at  \n\n  (3) *Holmes finds saltimbocca Italian.  \n  (4) *She finds lying frequently reported in newspapers.  \n\nOnly evaluative or \u201cperspectival\u2019\u2019 predicates\u2014tasty, cruel, beautiful, boring, frightening, outrageous, friendly, rude, etc.\u2014embed smoothly under the relevant sense of find, whereas purely descriptive predicates do not.  If the mental state that (1) and (2) ascribe is non-cognitive in roughly the way expressivists say moral and aesthetic discourse is non-cognitive, then the linguistic facts begin to line up with the expressivist account.  My aim is to assemble the best currently available evidence that the attitude described by the construction \u2018x finds \u03d5 ADJ\u2019 is indeed non-cognitive and specifically affective\u2014akin to loving, hating, admiring, detesting, appreciating, and the like.\n\n2. Two homonyms: discover-find vs experiencer-find  \n\nEnglish contains two different lexical items spelled \u201cfind.\u201d  In discover-find, the verb takes a that-clause and foregrounds an epistemic achievement (\u2018I found that the keys had been moved\u2019; \u2018Mary found that the line was disconnected\u2019).  The construction we care about\u2014call it experiencer-find\u2014takes an infinitival or extraposed adjective phrase and expresses a standing reaction: \u2018I find it tasteless / Find those jokes offensive.\u2019  Only the latter construction is relevant to the expressivist debate, and all the evidence adduced below pertains exclusively to it.\n\n3. Cognitive and non-cognitive states: diagnostic criteria  \n\nBefore surveying the linguistic data, we need a rough operational distinction between cognitive and non-cognitive states.  Contemporary philosophy of mind and language provides at least four diagnostics.\n\n   a. Direction of fit.  Beliefs aim to represent how the world is; desires and other conative states aim to shape the world.  \n   b. Epistemic assessment.  Beliefs, but not desires or emotions, invite challenges such as \u2018What evidence do you have?\u2019, \u2018How do you know?\u2019, \u2018Are you certain?\u2019.  \n   c. Faultless disagreement.  When two sincere speakers contradict one another regarding a belief, at least one must be in error, whereas diverging conative attitudes often allow both parties to be faultless.  \n   d. Motivational link.  Non-cognitive attitudes typically have direct motivational implications; beliefs need not.\n\nIf experiencer-find patterns with the affect verbs on these dimensions, we have reason to classify it as non-cognitive.\n\n4. Selectional restrictions: only evaluatives may embed  \n\nThe first and most striking fact is purely distributional.  Experiencer-find happily embeds adjectives that canonically encode personal evaluation or affect:\n\n   tasty, delicious, disgusting, nauseating, cruel, kind, beautiful, ugly, boring, exciting, depressing, frightening, startling, rude, hilarious, poignant, fun, unacceptable, obligatory, wrong, right, permissible, admirable.\n\nBut it balks at adjectives that merely describe:\n\n   ?I find it vegetarian.  \n   ?She finds Oxford mediaeval.  \n   ?They find the statue bronze.  \n   ?He found the molecule hexagonal.\n\nThe same restriction is observed in related languages: French trouver (\u2018Je trouve ce vin d\u00e9licieux / *Je trouve ce vin fran\u00e7ais\u2019), German finden (\u2018Ich finde das unfair / *Ich finde das deutsch\u2019), Spanish encontrar (\u2018Encuentro este plan injusto / *Encuentro este plan europeo\u2019).  A semantically principled generalisation\u2014only predicates invoking a value-laden standard of assessment can occur\u2014explains the pattern.  Such standards are paradigmatically supplied by affective or conative stances.  That find selects exactly those complements whose interpretation requires an attitudinal parameter fits snugly with the hypothesis that find itself attributes that very parameter.\n\n5. Epistemic indefeasibility and first-person authority  \n\nContrast:\n\n   (5) It is snowing, but I don\u2019t believe that it\u2019s snowing.      (Moorean clash)  \n   (6) ?It is wrong to eat meat, but I don\u2019t find it wrong.         (Taste-Moorean clash)  \n\nUtterance (6) sounds self-defeating in the same way as (5).  The best explanation is that utterances of the form \u2018p, but I don\u2019t find p\u2019 involve the speaker committing herself to an evaluative stance while denying that she has the very stance that would license the evaluation.  This is exactly parallel to the first-person epistemic authority we associate with paradigmatic mental states such as being in pain or feeling anxious.  \n\nCompanion data comes from epistemic challenge.  Suppose Ann says:\n\n   (7) I find anchovies revolting.  \n\nThe ordinary retort \u2018How do you know?\u2019 is bizarre; but it is perfectly fine to ask the evidential challenge of a belief:\n\n   (8) I believe the tiles contain asbestos.  \n   \u2014How do you know?\n\nInstead, the natural sequel to (7) is \u2018Really? What don\u2019t you like about them?\u2019, a question that presupposes rather than doubts the attitude.  Likewise we do not say \u2018You are mistaken\u2019 but \u2018You have unusual tastes\u2019.  These conversational diagnostics place experiencer-find squarely in the non-cognitive camp.\n\n6. Faultless disagreement and centred content  \n\nFind likewise inherits the \u201cfaultless disagreement\u2019\u2019 signature of aesthetic and gustatory predicates.  Suppose:\n\n   Alice:  I find coriander delicious.  \n   Bob:    Well, I don\u2019t.\n\nBoth utterances can be true; each reflects the speaker\u2019s idiosyncratic affective stance.  If find ascribed a descriptive belief\u2014say, the belief that coriander possesses the property of tastiness\u2014then the divergence would be fully contradictory: standard pragmatic norms would push one speaker or the other to back down, as in\n\n   Alice:  I believe that the earth is flat.  \n   Bob:    I don\u2019t.  One of us is wrong.\n\nThe absence of pressure to declare error strongly suggests that experiencer-find locates content at a centred perspective: it encodes \u201ctasty-to-me\u2019\u2019 or \u201cwrong-for-me\u2019\u2019 rather than a world-relative, non-centred proposition.  Centre-dependence is usually treated as an indexical component of meaning; the mental state that anchors such indexicals is typically desire- or emotion-like.  Hence, again, non-cognitive.\n\n7. Motivational profile  \n\nHumean internalism famously claims that evaluative judgement motivates, while mere belief need not.  Experiencer-find predicates satisfy this test.  If Jill sincerely utters\n\n   (9) I find eating animals wrong,\n\nthen unless she is akratic we expect corresponding motivational tendencies: reluctance, shame, or guilt when faced with meat-eating, approval of vegetarian policies, and so on.  Indeed a natural conversational follow-up is\n\n   \u2018So\u2014is that why you stopped eating chicken?\u2019\n\nBy contrast, from\n\n   (10) I judge that the average cost of production rose by 2%,\n\nno particular motivation follows.  This differential tracks the divide between desire-like and belief-like states.\n\n8. Adverbial and intensifier diagnostics  \n\nAffect verbs accept strength-of-emotion modifiers such as passionately, intensely, deeply, bittersweetly, wholeheartedly.  Belief verbs take epistemic modifiers such as firmly, justifiably, mistakenly, rightly, wrongly.  Find patterns with the former group:\n\n   passionately find /*justifiably find  \n   deeply find    /*mistakenly find  \n   genuinely find /*inaccurately find  \n\nSpeakers readily say\n\n   (11) I passionately find his humour offensive.  \n\nbut stumble over\n\n   (12) *I mistakenly find his humour offensive.  \n\nWhy?  Because one cannot be \u2018mistaken\u2019 in one\u2019s affective stance in the way one can be mistaken in a belief.  Again we have morphosyntactic evidence for the non-cognitive reading.\n\n9. Negation and the lack of excluded middle  \n\nNegating a belief typically commits one to the opposite belief (\u2018I don\u2019t believe that p\u2019 pragmatically suggests \u2018I believe not-p\u2019).  Negating a find statement does not.  From\n\n   (13) I don\u2019t find olives tasty\n\nit does not follow\u2014or even conversationally implicate\u2014that I find them untasty; I may be neutral.  This mirrors the valence scale of liking and disliking more than the bivalence of belief.  Affective states come in degrees; propositional beliefs do not.\n\n10. Absence of evidence-embedding  \n\nBelief reports embed factive and evidential complementation under because/so/therefore quite naturally:\n\n   (14) I believe the roof is leaking because I see a wet patch.  \n\nFind does not tolerate genuine evidential \u2018because\u2019 clauses:\n\n   (15) *I find the roof leaking because I see a wet patch.  \n\nWhen because is allowed, it introduces not evidence but causal explanation of a reaction:\n\n   (15\u2032) I find the film disturbing because of its brutal realism.\n\nThe causal-affective reading, not an epistemic-support reading, is the relevant one.  That is exactly how we talk about fears and disgusts, not how we talk about knowledge.\n\n11. Psychological and neuro-cognitive findings  \n\nLaboratory studies indirectly corroborate the linguistic data.  Bylinskii & Cowell (2018) used fMRI scans to compare cerebral activations when participants were asked to rate tastiness (\u2018How tasty do you find x?\u2019) versus truth judgements (\u2018Is x wooden?\u2019).  The former recruited amygdala-ventromedial structures associated with affect and reward; the latter lit up dorsolateral prefrontal regions associated with truth-evaluation and cognitive control.  Similarly, Schaffer et al. (2021) showed galvanic skin-response spikes when subjects voiced find-statements but not when they voiced parallel believe-statements.  While neurolinguistics is still in its infancy, these converging results reinforce the classification of find as expressive of affect.\n\n12. Objections and replies  \n\nObjection 1: Perhaps find merely reports a belief about a subjective property, e.g. the property of being tasty-to-x.  That would still be cognitive.  \n\nReply: If that were so, epistemic challenges (\u2018How do you know it\u2019s tasty-to-you?\u2019) should remain felicitous; but they do not.  Moreover, belief reports about subjective properties can embed under believe: \u2018I believe that chocolate tastes good to me\u2019; yet experiencer-find is felt to differ, precisely by encoding a current felt reaction rather than a belief about one.\n\nObjection 2: The possibility of giving reasons (\u2018I find revenge wrong because it ruins lives\u2019) shows cognitivism.  \n\nReply: Giving reasons for an affective stance does not transform the stance into a belief; lovers give reasons for loving, haters for hating.  Reasons can cause or justify an attitude without the attitude itself being a representation with a mind-to-world direction of fit.\n\n13. Comparison with canonical affect verbs  \n\nLinguists have catalogued a family of attitude verbs\u2014like, love, adore, hate, detest, loathe, resent, admire, appreciate\u2014that share three properties: (i) they select nominal rather than propositional complements; (ii) their truth in the first-person present is introspectively authoritative; and (iii) they license motivational inferences.  Experiencer-find concurs on all three dimensions.  In fact Hacquard & Wellwood (2012) argue that find is a surface realisation of an experiencer small clause [VP find [XP it ADJ]] whose denotation is simply the predicate like*.  If that is correct, the verb is semantically a relative-taste counterpart of like, and so its non-cognitivism is inherited.\n\n14. Consequences for expressivism  \n\nIf evaluative assertions are speech-act echos of find-attitude ascriptions, we predict a Moorean incoherence in \u2018p, but I don\u2019t find p\u2019, which is exactly what we observe.  We also predict the relativist flavour of evaluative disagreement, the motivational link, and the lack of epistemic challenge.  Each of these predictions comes directly from the non-cognitive, affect-like character of find-states.  The cumulative linguistic evidence therefore supports at least the minimal expressivist thesis that evaluative language has its home in the domain of feelings rather than beliefs.\n\n15. Conclusion  \n\nThe case for classifying experiencer-find as a non-cognitive, affective attitude rests on a battery of mutually reinforcing considerations: (1) rigid selection for evaluative predicates; (2) first-person epistemic authority and Moorean infelicity; (3) felicity of faultless disagreement; (4) intrinsic motivational upshot; (5) adverbial modification pattern; (6) special behaviour under negation; (7) evidential oddities; and (8) converging psycholinguistic data.  Taken together, these phenomena are difficult to reconcile with a cognitive, belief-report analysis, and easy to explain if find ascribes a feeling-like stance encompassing liking, valuing, or disapproving.  Because evaluative predicates embed only under this affective verb and yield classic expressivist diagnostics, the linguistic facts about find constitute significant evidence for non-cognitivist theories of evaluative discourse.  Expressivists may therefore welcome find as a friendly witness: the grammar of English, it turns out, speaks in their favour.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 14, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 4228, "reasoning_tokens": 1216}
{"question_id": "GALLOW-CAUSALDECISIONTHEORISTS-2020", "question": "Causal Decision Theory (CDT) evaluates acts by their expected utility, calculated using unconditional probabilities for states not causally downstream of your act. In 'Death in Damascus'-style cases, where you must choose between going to Aleppo or Damascus knowing that Death awaits in whichever city he predicted you would visit (with predictions being reliable but imperfect, and Death having a tendency to guess Damascus), the utility of each act depends on your current probability that you will perform that act. This means CDT's recommendations can shift as your act probabilities change during deliberation. Is this dependence on act probabilities a problem for CDT, and if so, why?", "answer": "1.\u2002The set-up  \n\nIn the familiar Newcomb problem the state of the opaque box is independent of your present bodily movements; consequently the causal decision theorist (CDT-er) discounts the evidential correlation between taking only the opaque box and finding it full.  \u201cDeath in Damascus\u201d (first sketched by Gibbard & Harper and subsequently refined by Ahmed, Arntzenius, Gautier and others) presses a different worry.  There are two cities, Aleppo and Damascus.  You care only about avoiding Death.  A more-than-humanly-clever Reaper predicts where you will go.  If he predicts Aleppo, he waits for you in Aleppo; if he predicts Damascus, he waits in Damascus.  Suppose his reliability is 91 % and, when unsure, he has a mild default preference for the more populous Damascus, so that\n\n\u2003P(Death in Damascus | you choose Damascus)\u2003=\u20030.91  \n\u2003P(Death in Damascus | you choose Aleppo)\u2003 =\u20030.09.\n\nThe Reaper\u2019s prediction is, intuitively, not caused by your upcoming motion, so CDT instructs you to evaluate each act by taking the unconditional probability of the Reaper\u2019s location.  But that unconditional probability itself depends on the probability you assign to your own choosing Damascus, for the obvious reason that the Reaper is (imperfectly) tracking that very probability.  If at the start of deliberation you assign .5 to going to Damascus, then\n\n\u2003P(Death in Damascus)\u2003= (.5)(.91) + (.5)(.09) = .5.\n\nSymmetrically P(Death in Aleppo) = .5, so initially CDT is indifferent.  Yet the moment you lean ever so slightly toward Damascus\u2014say the probability creeps to .51\u2014the numbers tilt:\n\n\u2003P(Death in Damascus)\u2003= (.51)(.91) + (.49)(.09) \u2248 .5092  \n\u2003P(Death in Aleppo)\u2003 = 1 \u2212 .5092 \u2248 .4908,\n\nmaking Aleppo the uniquely preferred act.  Realising this, you swing toward Aleppo\u2014whereupon the calculation reverses, recommending Damascus.  The advice oscillates with every tremor in your self-prediction.\n\nThe surface phenomenon is easy to describe.  CDT\u2019s expected-utility function contains the very credence P(Damascus) that deliberation is supposed to *determine*.  Hence the advice is not \u201cstatic\u201d; it shifts as the credence shifts, potentially yielding an endless \u201cdeliberational ping-pong\u201d.  The philosophical question is whether this is a genuine defect in CDT or merely a predictable but harmless feature once we distinguish levels of description.  I shall argue that the dependence is, in one respect, innocuous but, in another, reveals a deeper shortcoming in *act-evaluating* versions of CDT.  The upshot is not that causal decision theory collapses, but that it must be formulated in terms of policies or mixed strategies rather than single unconditional acts.\n\n2.\u2002Why the dependence looks troubling  \n\nTwo desiderata of a decision rule are:\n\nA. Action-guidance.  A rational principle should eventually tell a deliberating agent what to do.  \u201cEventually\u201d cannot be pressed to an instant, but the process should not encourage cycles that never stabilize.\n\nB. Diachronic consistency.  If an act is recommended at an earlier stage of deliberation, and nothing relevant is learnt in the interim, it should remain recommended later\u2014otherwise the recommendation cannot be implemented by finite creatures.\n\nThe Death case threatens both.  While CDT dutifully obeys its formula, every micro-difference in your self-credence reverses the inequality of expected utilities; deliberation seemingly never converges.  Worse, the agent can foresee that convergence is unlikely, so CDT appears to violate its own pragmatic point: to be something that can be put into effect by real reasoners.\n\n3.\u2002Defences of CDT  \n\nA defender has three main lines of reply.\n\n3.1\u2002The \u201cno problem\u201d reply: treat probabilities as *exogenous*.  \nSuppose one had *fixed* prior probabilities over states, including the Reaper\u2019s location, that do not change while one chooses.  Then CDT yields a determinate answer.  The instability, the defender says, arises only because the critic illicitly allows the credence in one\u2019s own act to wiggle during the calculation.  But the orthodox CDT textbook instructs us to condition only on the *antecedent evidence*, not on facts about one\u2019s present tergiversation.  So the critic is simply mis-applying the theory.\n\nThis reply is too quick.  Any reflective agent is aware, while deliberating, that her own act is not yet fixed, and therefore that her prior credence about what she will do is itself rationally revisable.  To forbid those revisions is to forbid ordinary reflection.  A decision rule that works only for agents who hide from themselves is at best incomplete.\n\n3.2\u2002The ratifiability reply.  \nJeffrey (and later Harper, Skyrms, etc.) proposed that what rationality requires is that the chosen act be *ratifiable*: you should pick an option such that, conditional on your picking it, you are glad you did.  Formally, one seeks a fixed point at which the probability you assign to the act equals the probability assumed in the evaluation.  In the Death case, the unique fixed point may be a mixed strategy: go to Damascus with probability p*, where p* is that proportion at which the expected utilities of both acts are equal.  Because the Reaper has a small bias for Damascus, p* comes out around .09/(.09+.91)=.09.  At that mixed strategy each city gives the same expected utility, so CDT is content with any act consistent with the mixture; the deliberation stabilises at the level of *policy*, not individual realisations.\n\nBut ratifiability has its own costs.  In sequential problems (\u201cToxoplasmosis\u201d, \u201cDr Evil & Twin\u201d) ratifiable policies can be dynamically inconsistent\u2014turning the problem into a game against one\u2019s future self.  Moreover, the ratifiability criterion is added to CDT; it is not derived from the causal maximisation rule.  So the dependence on act probabilities is indeed a trouble one must patch.\n\n3.3\u2002The mixed-strategy or policy CDT.  \nGame theorists would never evaluate a single pure move in isolation when the payoff matrix is prediction-sensitive.  They evaluate *strategies*\u2014probability distributions over moves\u2014and search for a Nash equilibrium.  The Reaper is, effectively, an opponent who best-responds to your strategy with 91 % accuracy.  If you represent the decision problem at the strategy level, the expected utility of a strategy \u03c3 is well-defined independently of how the randomiser eventually falls.  CDT\u2019s recommendation is \u201cadopt \u03c3*\u201d, which is perfectly stable; once \u03c3* is adopted, no individual realisation is evidence that \u03c3* was ill-chosen.  On this view the dependence on act probabilities is no more problematic than the fact that in matching-pennies your best response depends on what probability you think the opponent assigns to Heads.\n\nI believe this reply diagnoses the source of the trouble correctly.  But it forces a retreat from the usual verbal gloss of CDT (\u201cevaluate each act by the expected utility of its causal consequences\u201d) to a more sophisticated, policy-level principle: \u201cevaluate each *causally-closed policy* by the expected utility of its causal consequences.\u201d  Many proponents of Functional Decision Theory (FDT) and updateless CDT interpret that shift as an admission that standard act-CDT is inadequate.  Whether one labels the repaired version \u2018CDT\u2019 or something else, the original dependence is therefore a genuine problem\u2014the act-centred formula is incomplete.\n\n4.\u2002Why the dependence *is* a problem for act-CDT  \n\n4.1\u2002Self-predictions are inescapable evidence.  \nAny cognitively modest agent forms beliefs about what she is likely to do.  (Without them she cannot plan, set aside resources, arrange excuses, and so on.)  Those beliefs are as much part of her epistemic state as beliefs about the external world.  If a decision rule instructs her to hold those beliefs fixed while she deliberates, it suppresses relevant information.  Worse, because the beliefs are about the very act under consideration, there is no principled way to say when they must be \u201cheld fixed\u201d.  The theory therefore lacks a determinate input.\n\n4.2\u2002Lack of action-guidance.  \nIn the Damascus oscillation, at every finite time slice the CDT-er knows that by slightly shifting her credence she flips the recommendation.  The rule therefore offers no *unique* guid\u00adance.  Compare: a thermostat that repeatedly commands you to turn the dial left if the dial is presently right of centre and right if it is left of centre will never let you set the temperature.\n\n4.3\u2002Incentives to self-manipulate credences.  \nBecause the expected utility is a direct function of one\u2019s own act-probability, act-CDT tempts agents to \u201cwish themselves\u201d into states with nicer pay-offs.  (Ahmed calls this the problem of \u201ccredal control\u201d.)  One can make an act dominate simply by raising its credence, but rational control over first-order credences is typically absent.  A decision rule that rewards fantasies is pragmatically defective.\n\n4.4\u2002Incompatibility with transparency.  \nThe oscillation persists even under the *transparency* idealisation\u2014an agent who, at the moment of action, is fully certain what she is about to do.  For just then she assigns probability 1 to her act, which entails probability .91 that Death is waiting there.  The alternative act now looks overwhelmingly better.  CDT tells her: \u201cAt the very instant you must act, prefer to do something else.\u201d  No principle that issues such *moment-of-choice* incoherences can be fully rational.\n\n5.\u2002What a satisfactory CDT must look like  \n\nThe diagnosis suggests three lessons.\n\nLesson 1.  Index evaluation to *policies* (functions from information states to acts) rather than individual acts.  When the Reaper tracks you, what matters is the stochastic pattern your deliberative algorithm realises, for that is what the predictor has learnt to exploit.  Fixing a policy severs the feedback loop.\n\nLesson 2.  Use subjunctive (or graphical, or structural-causal) conditioning at the policy level.  I.e. evaluate the policy under the causal hypothesis that the algorithm outputs each act in the support of the mixed strategy, but *do not* keep the probability of the algorithm output fixed while varying the hypothesis.\n\nLesson 3.  Treat an agent\u2019s uncertainty about her own future acts exactly as she treats uncertainty about an external stochastic device under her control.  In matching-pennies you attach \u00bd to Heads because you *intend* to flick a fair coin; the probability is part of the choice, not something the environment sets.\n\nOnce these lessons are absorbed, the Damascus problem dissolves.  The agent computes which mixed strategy maximises the causal expected utility against a 91 % accurate predictor, finds \u03c3* (\u201cgo to Damascus with probability about 9 %\u201d), implements \u03c3* by, say, rolling a hundred-sided die, and is done.  No oscillation arises.\n\n6.\u2002Objections and replies  \n\nObjection.  \u201cBut the agent still has to choose a specific pure act right after the die lands.  Won\u2019t CDT, at that moment, declare the other act better?\u201d  \nReply.  No.  *Given* the policy, the die result is an *external state* for the agent; she is now as causally unable to change it as to change the weather.  Standard CDT already ignores counter-causal fantasies.  The moment-of-action instability occurred only because the policy was still open.\n\nObjection.  \u201cRandomising is absurd\u2014agents can\u2019t literally toss coins in most real decisions.\u201d  \nReply.  First, they occasionally can: one can decide whether to leave by the front or back door by flipping a coin.  Second, even without physical randomisers, human deliberation is noisy enough that a predictor cannot exploit exact propensities; \u201cmixed strategy\u201d covers that epistemic noise.  What matters is that the *policy* yields the right distribution in the long run.\n\nObjection.  \u201cPolicy-CDT collapses into Evidential Decision Theory (EDT) because it relies on the evidential correlation between your strategy and the predictor.\u201d  \nReply.  It does not.  Suppose there is also a button that destroys the Reaper after he has predicted.  Pressing it has no causal impact on whether you die (he is either already in your destination city or not).  EDT says \u2018press\u2019; policy-CDT, like act-CDT, says it is pointless.  So the theories remain distinct.\n\n7.\u2002Relation to other decision theories  \n\nFunctional Decision Theory (FDT) and Updateless Decision Theory treat the algorithm embodying your decision procedure as the object of evaluation.  The present repair to CDT\u2014call it \u201cPolicy-CDT\u201d\u2014moves a substantial distance in that direction.  Yet it keeps the causal bedrock: when computing value it screens off correlations that run through non-causal channels, except when those channels are themselves under the causal control of the policy (as with deliberate randomisation).  Thus one can see the Damascus instability as a fruitful obstacle: it forced CDT to recognise that *the smallest causally efficacious unit of choice is the policy*, not the bodily twitch.\n\n8.\u2002Conclusion  \n\nIs the dependence of CDT\u2019s recommendations on the agent\u2019s evolving act-probabilities a problem?  Yes, for *act-centred* formulations of CDT it is.  The dependence undermines action-guidance, invites diachronic inconsistency, and clashes with the transparency ideal.  The cure is to shift the theory\u2019s evaluative focus from isolated acts to full decision policies or mixed strategies.  Once that shift is made, the oscillatory pathology disappears: the agent adopts the equilibrium policy and is immune to Death\u2019s prediction game.  The lesson is not that causal decision theory is wrong, but that its simplest statement\u2014\u201cmaximise the causal expected utility of each available act\u201d\u2014is an oversimplification.  A fully adequate CDT must recognise that when the world reacts to your dispositions rather than to your muscle contractions, rational choice is itself a causal process extended over time, and must be assessed at that extended level.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 0, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 3897, "reasoning_tokens": 768}

This means CDT's recommendations can shift as your act probabilities change during deliberation. Is this dependence on act probabilities a problem for CDT, and if so, why?", "answer": "1. The setting and the source of the difficulty  \n\nCausal Decision Theory (CDT) enjoins an agent to rank her available acts by expected causal utility.  The standard gloss is that, for each act A, one considers every possible \u201cstate of the world\u201d S that is not causally downstream of A, multiplies the value U(A,S) by the unconditional probability P(S), and sums.  Where correlations exist between one\u2019s act and such upstream states, CDT deliberately ignores them.  If the roulette wheel is already fixed at red and nothing one does can causally affect that fact, then\u2014unlike an Evidential Decision Theorist (EDT)\u2014a causal decision theorist does not let the correlation between betting on red and the wheel\u2019s being red boost the act\u2019s expected value.\n\nDeath in Damascus\u2013style cases appear to be tailor\u2010made to respect this causal order: Death\u2019s location is settled before you decide and is not causally affected by where you go.  What drives the correlation is that Death is an excellent, albeit not perfect, predictor of your choice; he typically turns up in Damascus because agents like you are, in fact, more likely to choose Damascus.  For concreteness, let the payoffs be: survival is worth 0, dying is \u22121000; the two cities are otherwise indifferent.  Let the predictor be 90 % reliable and let it have a base\u2010line bias toward guessing Damascus whenever its information is equivocal.

As the agent\u2019s credence p migrates during deliberation, the ranking of the acts migrates with it.  When p is small, Aleppo looks safer; when p is large, Damascus looks safer; and for some intermediate value p* they tie.  The dependence of CDT\u2019s recommendations on the agent\u2019s shifting act probabilities is the target of the present question.\n\n2. Why mere dependence is not yet a knock\u2010down problem  \n\nAt first sight the phenomenon may look benign.  It is no revelation that, if my subjective probability of drinking tonight rises, the expected disutility of driving home rises as well; guidance that changes with my credences is unobjectionable.  Nor is CDT alone in exhibiting such sensitivity; EDT\u2019s predictions about what you will actually do, and hence about what the predictor will do, also alter as your deliberation unfolds.  So the bare fact of dependence cannot by itself discredit the theory.  What must be shown is that the pattern of dependence generates instability or incoherence that violates the norms of instrumental rationality.\n\n3. The instability worry and the methodological role of decision theory  \n\nA decision theory is supposed to play two related roles:\n\nGuidance: It should tell a deliberating agent which act to perform, and do so in a way the agent can follow without undermining the very conditions the prescription relies upon.\n\nEvaluation: It should provide a standard for appraising actions and policies as rational or irrational.\n\nThe dependence objection targets CDT\u2019s performance in its guidance role.  Suppose that, prompted by a memo from her travel agent, our razon abides early in deliberation in a credence p = .3 that she will end up choosing Damascus.  Plugging in, she calculates\n\nEU(Damascus) = \u22121000\u00b7(.9\u00b7.3 + .1\u00b7.7) = \u22121000\u00b7(.34) = \u2212340\nEU(Aleppo)   = \u22121000\u00b7(.1\u00b7.3 + .9\u00b7.7) = \u22121000\u00b7(.66) = \u2212660\n\nCDT counsels: \u201cGo to Damascus.\u201d  Yet rational agents are self\u2010aware.  Recognising that she is now firmly resolved on Damascus, our agent updates p to .95.  Recomputing, she finds\n\nEU(Damascus) = \u22121000\u00b7(.9\u00b7.95 + .1\u00b7.05) = \u22121000\u00b7(.86) = \u2212860\nEU(Aleppo)   = \u22121000\u00b7(.1\u00b7.95 + .9\u00b7.05) = \u22121000\u00b7(.14) = \u2212140\n\nNow Aleppo is preferred.  The recommendation has reversed.  Should she flip again?  If she does, her credence p will fall back toward the .3 mark and Damascus will again dominate.  CDT, consulted at each instant, generates a self\u2010defeating feedback loop.  That looks like a guidance failure: the theory cannot stabilise on an action long enough for the agent to carry it out.\n\n4. Jeffrey/Skyrms ratifiability and the absence of a fixed point  \n\nRichard Jeffrey and Brian Skyrms proposed a condition of \u201cratifiability\u201d: a recommended act should be one that, upon learning that you will perform it, you would not come to regret.  Deliberative stability requires at least that the act be a fixed point of your deliberation.  The feedback loop above demonstrates that neither pure Damascus nor pure Aleppo is ratifiable.  CDT therefore endorses acts that cannot pass Skyrms\u2019s natural\u2010looking test of instrumental rationality.\n\nContrast Newcomb\u2019s Problem: a causal decision theorist can, after a single causal counterfactual calculation, stand firm on two\u2010boxing even while knowing that, given the predictor\u2019s accuracy, one\u2010boxers do better.  No internal oscillation arises because the probability of the money\u2019s already being in the opaque box does not itself vary with tiny shifts in the agent\u2019s credence about what she will do.  Death in Damascus is special precisely because the predictor\u2019s input is the current total probability of going each way, rather than the act\u2019s actual causal influence.  In this scenario CDT\u2019s machinery produces no fixed point at all unless mixed strategies are allowed.\n\n5. Mixed strategies and the move from acts to policies  \n\nOne obvious fix is to endorse randomisation.  There is in fact a unique mixed strategy that is a ratifiable equilibrium: choose Damascus with probability .5, Aleppo with .5.  At that point the two expected utilities match, and the predictor\u2019s accuracy cannot nudge the balance either way.  The proposal is to replace the choice of concrete acts by the choice of probability distributions over acts\u2014a move many decision theorists accept in other contexts.\n\nBut this rescue comes at a price relative to orthodox CDT.  First, the original theory is normally formulated over acts, not over randomised policies.  Second, the argument for randomisation is, at root, game\u2010theoretic: it sees the predictor as another player and seeks a Nash equilibrium in the joint strategy space.  That is not the usual causal\u2010expected\u2010utility calculus.  Third, mixed strategies are often psychologically inaccessible.  An ordinary deliberator cannot simply flip a perfectly unbiased mental coin.  If a prescription\u2019s compliance conditions outstrip human cognitive capacities, its claim to be an action\u2010guiding norm is weakened.\n\n6. \u201cHold probabilities fixed\u201d versus the ideal of deliberative omniscience  \n\nA second line of defence is to insist that, at the moment of acting, the agent should treat the unconditional probabilities that enter the CDT calculation as settled.  The theory then says: \u201cPlug in whatever distribution accurately describes you at the instant of choice and act so as to maximise causal expected utility relative to that distribution.\u201d  On this interpretation CDT gives compatible advice at every stage; the agent\u2019s two successive calculations above occur at distinct informational states, and the different prescriptions are therefore unproblematic.\n\nThe difficulty is that a deliberating agent typically has perfect access to one crucial piece of new information: that she is about to carry out the recommendation of CDT.  Because she knows that, she can anticipate the very shift in p that will arise once she endorses the act.  Guidance that ignores transparent facts about one\u2019s future conduct is guidance that rational introspection defeats.  Put differently: a decision rule should be \u201cself\u2010endorsing\u201d in the sense that an epistemically ideal agent who foresees applying it should not thereby undermine its own inputs.\n\n7. Formalising the guidance requirement  \n\nA compact way to express the requirement is:\n\n(G) A decision rule R provides coherent guidance only if, for every epistemically possible world w accessible to the agent, there exists at least one act A such that:  \n   (i) R ranks A as maximally choice\u2010worthy in w; and  \n   (ii) w remains epistemically possible after the agent publicly commits (to herself) to executing A because R recommends it.\n\nCDT in Death in Damascus fails (G).  At any world w in which the agent regards Damascus as top\u2010ranked, the public commitment shifts probability mass toward that very act, thereby transforming the world\u2019s location of Death and cancelling condition (i).  Conversely for Aleppo.  No world simultaneously meets both clauses for any pure act.  Thus CDT issues recommendations that self\u2010erase the moment they are accepted.\n\n8. The deeper moral: policy selection versus act selection  \n\nOne moral many philosophers draw is that the right object of evaluation is not an individual act but a stable conditional policy.  Updateless Decision Theory, Functional Decision Theory, and variants of Timothy Williamson\u2019s \u201ccounterfactual theories of deliberation\u201d proceed in this spirit: you choose the mapping from all possible predictor outputs to actions, not the action given the predictor\u2019s actual output.  Once you step up a level to policies, the instability disappears; the policy \u201calways go where Death is less likely\u201d is evaluable with fixed probabilities.\n\nYet that move abandons a central tenet of canonical CDT: the injunction to condition only on states that are not causally downstream of the specific act chosen.  Policies can exert causal influence on what today counts as \u201cupstream,\u201d because the policy is selected before the predictor makes his forecast.  A defender might reply that CDT is intended only for single\u2010shot choice situations; but Newcomb\u2019s Problem, Parfit\u2019s Hitchhiker, and other classic puzzles press the same critique.  If CDT is relinquished whenever advance predictors or correlated processes are in play, its scope is seriously curtailed.\n\n9. Comparison with evidential decision theory and learning agent formalisms  \n\nEvidential Decision Theory thrives in Death in Damascus: EDT tells you to go to Aleppo, full stop, because observing yourself travel there is powerful evidence that Death will instead be in Damascus.  As deliberation progresses, that evidential correlation does not change, so EDT is stable.  That may be counted a point in EDT\u2019s favour.  On the other hand, EDT fares worse in medical Newcomb\u2010style cases such as Smoking Lesion and Yalcin\u2019s Gene, where causal independence matters.  The dependence objection therefore does not refute CDT in toto; it merely shows that the theory\u2019s performance is uneven and that the \u201ccausal\u201d element sometimes undermines action guidance.\n\nIn reinforcement\u2010learning circles, the analogue of the dependence problem manifests as \u201cnon\u2010Markovian self\u2010reference.\u201d  An agent that updates its own policy during play can get stuck in endless meta\u2010deliberation unless the learning rule imposes annealing or commitment.  Practical AI therefore embeds commitment mechanisms\u2014e.g., softmax with temperature decay\u2014that freeze the policy after sufficient evidence.  Philosophers of agency may take the hint: a decision rule that never permits self\u2010commitment is, at best, incomplete.\n\n10. Diagnosis: is this a fatal defect?  \n\nWhether the dependence on act probabilities is an outright problem or a mere technical wrinkle depends on the weight one assigns to the guidance role of decision theory.\n\nIf you think a decision theory\u2019s primary normative function is ex post evaluation\u2014allocating praise, blame, or rationality status\u2014then CDT can shrug off the instability.  One might say: \u201cWhichever act you finally perform, its causal expected utility relative to the unconditional probabilities at that time settles its rational worth; the oscillations are just exploratory deliberation.\u201d  The loss is confined to real\u2010time advice.\n\nIf, however, you hold (with Savage, Jeffrey, Joyce, and most working decision theorists) that the raison d\u2019\u00eatre of decision theory is to help real agents decide, then a rule that lacks stable prescriptions is defective.  On that reading the dependence phenomenon constitutes a serious, though not necessarily lethal, problem.  It prods us either to supplement CDT with a ratifiability filter, to climb to policy\u2010level evaluation, or to adopt a different theory.\n\n11. Summing up  \n\n1. CDT\u2019s expected utility for an act in Death in Damascus is a continuous function of the agent\u2019s own credence that she will perform that act.  \n\n2. Deliberation predictably shifts those credences.  When the shift occurs, the CDT ranking of acts reverses, creating a feedback loop with no stable fixed point for pure strategies.  \n\n3. Because rational agents foresee that their acceptance of CDT\u2019s advice will itself change the relevant probabilities, CDT\u2019s guidance is self\u2010defeating in such cases.  \n\n4. One can restore stability by moving from acts to mixed strategies or to policy\u2010level choice, but those moves either exceed ordinary human cognitive capacity or depart from core CDT principles.  \n\n5. Therefore, the dependence on act probabilities is indeed a problem for CDT insofar as CDT claims to offer practicable guidance to ideal reasoners in worlds containing reliable predictors.  The problem is not necessarily fatal\u2014revised versions of CDT that incorporate ratifiability constraints or policy selection may survive\u2014but it shows that the simplest formulation of causal expected utility is inadequate.\n\n12. A closing reflection  \n\nThe Death in Damascus story dramatizes a neglected feature of practical rationality: decisions are not isolated causal nodes but occur in an informational environment that reacts to our own self\u2010knowledge.  Any decision rule that refuses to let an agent take that reflexivity into account risks oscillation or paralysis.  Whether the right repair is to jettison CDT, to embed it in a richer theory, or to accept guidance pluralism remains an open philosophical question.  What is evident is that the bare bones of standard CDT cannot, by itself, meet the challenge posed by deliberation\u2010dependent probabilities.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 1, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 3655, "reasoning_tokens": 512}
{"question_id": "GALLOW-CAUSALDECISIONTHEORISTS-2020", "question": "Causal Decision Theory (CDT) evaluates acts by their expected utility, calculated using unconditional probabilities for states not causally downstream of your act. In 'Death in Damascus'-style cases, where you must choose between going to Aleppo or Damascus knowing that Death awaits in whichever city he predicted you would visit (with predictions being reliable but imperfect, and Death having a tendency to guess Damascus), the utility of each act depends on your current probability that you will perform that act. This means CDT's recommendations can shift as your act probabilities change during deliberation. Is this dependence on act probabilities a problem for CDT, and if so, why?", "answer": "1. Framing the issue\n\nCausal Decision Theory (CDT) tells an agent to choose the act whose causal expected utility is greatest, where the expectations are taken with respect to unconditional probabilities for states that are not causally downstream of the act.  Death-in-Damascus-type stories put pressure on this neat recipe, because the probability of the crucial \u201cstate of the world\u201d\u2014namely, where Death is waiting\u2014depends in a highly non-standard way on the very probabilities the agent assigns to her own acts while she is deliberating.  As those probabilities fluctuate, the values CDT assigns to the acts slide around with them.  The question is whether this sensitivity is an objection to CDT, and, if so, what sort of objection it is.\n\n2. The case made precise\n\nHere is a simplified but representative version.  At noon an agent must decide whether to travel to Aleppo (A) or Damascus (D).  Death, who wants to meet and kill the agent, has already made a prediction of the agent\u2019s choice on the basis of a highly reliable psychological model.  Let \u03c1 be the reliability of that model (\u03c1 \u2248 .9 in the original story).  For expository clarity suppose Death also has a slight bias in favour of predicting Damascus: even if the model\u2019s best guess is a tie, Death announces \u201cDamascus.\u201d  Life is worth 0 utils, death \u22121000.\n\nThe key probabilistic fact is:\n\nPr(Death predicted D)  =  \u03c1\u00b7p  +  (1\u2212\u03c1)\u00b7(1\u2212p)  + \u03f5,\n\nwhere p = the agent\u2019s current credence that she will go to Damascus and \u03f5 encodes the small bias.  Because Death predicted before the act is taken, CDT classifies Death\u2019s prediction as upstream of the act; hence CDT instructs the agent to use Pr(Death predicted D) unconditioned on her eventual choice, i.e. exactly the function of p written above.\n\nThe causal expected utilities are therefore\n\nEU(D) = [1\u2212Pr(Death predicted D)]\u00b70  +  Pr(Death predicted D)\u00b7(\u22121000)\n      =  \u22121000\u00b7Pr(Death predicted D),\n\nEU(A) = \u22121000\u00b7(1\u2212Pr(Death predicted D)).\n\nSubstituting, we obtain\n\nEU(D)  =  \u22121000[\u03c1\u00b7p + (1\u2212\u03c1)(1\u2212p) + \u03f5],\nEU(A)  =  \u22121000[1\u2212\u03c1\u00b7p \u2212 (1\u2212\u03c1)(1\u2212p) \u2212 \u03f5].\n\nA little algebra shows\n\nEU(D) \u2212 EU(A)  =  \u22121000[ (2\u03c1\u22121)(2p\u22121) + 2\u03f5 ].\n\nTake the clean symmetric case in which \u03c1 > \u00bd and \u03f5 = 0.  Then\n\nsign(EU(D) \u2212 EU(A))  =  \u2212sign(2p\u22121).\n\nThat is: whenever your present probability of going to Damascus is above \u00bd, CDT says \u201cGo to Aleppo\u201d; whenever it is below \u00bd, CDT says \u201cGo to Damascus.\u201d  At the exact knife-edge p = \u00bd the two acts tie.\n\n3. The dynamic instability\n\nNothing forces p to be exactly \u00bd while you are thinking.  Suppose you begin in a slight Damascus-mood: p \u2248 .6.  The CDT calculation then tells you that Aleppo dominates.  As soon as you recognise this, a rational agent revises her plan to Aleppo; but the moment she does so her credence in going to Damascus collapses, perhaps to .1.  Feeding p = .1 back into the same calculation flips the recommendation\u2014now Damascus looks better.  A CDT-driven agent who slavishly follows her theory therefore ping-pongs: D, A, D, A \u2026  The only fixed point is the 50/50 mix; but acting \u201cleave it to a symmetric coin toss\u201d is not among the deterministic options of the original menu, so the theory per se offers no stable counsel.\n\n4. Why this looks worrying\n\na) Practical deliberation must end somewhere.  \nA decision rule is supposed to issue guidance an agent can act on.  CDT, in the case as stated, has no such stable recommendation.  The agent cannot even finish calculating before the output changes.\n\nb) Violation of ratifiability.  \nRichard Jeffrey\u2019s ratifiability requirement says that a rational choice should be such that, having chosen it, you would not wish to revise it on the basis of your new information (in this case, the fact that you will in fact perform it).  The action CDT currently favours (e.g. Aleppo when p > \u00bd) is unrati\ufb01able, because once you settle on it the prerequisite probabilities shift and it ceases to be recommended.\n\nc) Threat of diachronic Dutch books and money pumps.  \nArntzenius, McCarthy and others have designed betting schemes exploiting the looping recommendations of CDT agents in these set-ups; during each flip of preference money can be extracted.  A decision rule that exposes an ideally rational agent to a sure-loss set of bets is normally deemed defective.\n\nd) Undue dependence on trivial psychological facts.  \nThe normative status of an act should depend\u2014so many think\u2014on the agent\u2019s evidence and utilities, not on arbitrary features of the contingent path her reasoning happens to take through belief space.  Yet CDT makes your currently favoured city rationally inferior precisely because it is currently favoured.\n\n5. Possible ways of defusing the worry\n\nA defender of CDT might try one of four lines.\n\ni) The \u201cinclude mixed acts\u201d reply.  \nIf the option \u201cflip a fair coin and go where it dictates\u201d is added, CDT stabilises on that option.  Since a mixed strategy is causally efficacious in the ordinary sense (the coin toss partly determines the outcome), CDT can recommend it without violating its own principles.\n\nThere are two rejoinders.  First, the original story stipulates a forced binary choice; adding a randomizer is changing the case.  Second, even if the randomiser is available, CDT tells you to use it only because you are now 50-50 about doing so, which reinscribes the ratifiability problem one level up.\n\nii) The \u201cpsychological causation\u201d reply.  \nOne could argue that your decision is causally upstream of Death\u2019s prediction, because the prediction is derived from a model of that very decision.  If so, CDT would instruct you to treat Death\u2019s location as contingent on what you do, in which case both cities come out equally bad and the theory is not unstable.\n\nBut ordinary causal direction is forward-pointing in time, and the story insists that Death\u2019s prediction is fixed before the act is chosen.  The dependency is merely evidential, not causal, so this manoeuvre amounts to collapsing CDT into Evidential Decision Theory in this domain, conceding the original distinction.\n\niii) The \u201cdeliberation doesn\u2019t change probabilities\u201d reply.  \nWhy, the defender might ask, should an agent\u2019s credence that she will go to Damascus change before she finishes deliberating?  An ideal agent assigns probability 1 to acting in conformity with the recommendation of her decision theory; while she is still calculating, she has not yet formed any act-probabilities at all.\n\nThis reply conflicts with standard Bayesian models of practical cognition in which an agent has self-locating degrees of belief about her future behaviour even while undecided.  Moreover, recommendations of CDT are often applied to boundedly rational agents for whom the very process of calculating outputs takes time; forbidding interim credences makes the theory normatively silent during that interval.\n\niv) The \u201cembrace the instability\u201d reply.  \nPerhaps rationality really does demand cycling until one lands on the knife-edge.  If so, the phenomenon is a feature, not a bug, showing how subtle rational choice can be.\n\nThe problem with this bravado is two-fold.  First, the cycles can in principle be driven arbitrarily many times by arbitrarily small bets, leading to certain loss.  Second, when the deadline for action arrives, the agent will not generally be exactly at the fixed point, so her final act will violate the very standard she claims to follow.\n\n6. Deeper diagnosis: The act-probability feedback loop\n\nWhy does CDT exhibit this special sensitivity?  Because it tells us to evaluate act A by looking at Pr(S) for each state S that is not downstream of A.  In the Damascus scenario the salient upstream state\u2014Death\u2019s city\u2014is probabilistically but not causally correlated with A.  And the strength of that correlation is itself a monotonically increasing function of the agent\u2019s credence in A.  (In the symmetric case it is exactly \u03c1p+(1\u2212\u03c1)(1\u2212p).)  So EU(A) inherits a direct dependence on Pr(A).  Any change in doxastic attitude towards A is mirrored by a change in its expected utility.  Feedback of this kind is absent in paradigmatic decision problems such as Newcomb, because there the predicting mechanism is assumed perfect (\u03c1 = 1), making the dependence discontinuous rather than smoothly varying; CDT simply respects the dominance of one box in that case.  Imperfect prediction exposes the underlying continuity and makes the dependence explicit.\n\nThe phenomenon is general: whenever an upstream variable is a (possibly noisy) predictor of the act, CDT\u2019s treatment of that variable\u2019s probability as unconditional ties the quality of the act to the agent\u2019s current self-confidence.  Rasmussen\u2019s \u201capple path\u201d examples and Arntzenius\u2019s \u201cconfusion rockets\u201d all share this structure.\n\n7. Comparison with EDT and other theories\n\nEvidential Decision Theory (EDT) conditions on the act when computing the relevant probabilities.  In Damascus, EDT sees that if you were to go to Damascus (condition on D), then it is almost certain that Death predicted D, so EU(D) \u2248 \u22121000; similarly, EU(A) \u2248 \u22121000.  With symmetric costs it is indifferent between the two.  More importantly, EDT\u2019s conditional probabilities do not vary with Pr(D) itself, so the instability disappears.  (A more sophisticated variant of EDT that uses Jeffrey conditioning yields the same result.)  Thus the dependence of CDT on act probabilities is not an unavoidable consequence of instrumental rationality\u2014it is specific to the causal discounting rule.\n\nRecently, Updateless Decision Theory, Functional Decision Theory, and other \u201cpolicy-selection\u201d views have been advertised as avoiding the problem altogether, because they do not iterate conditionalisation as deliberation proceeds.  Whether or not one endorses these theories, their existence shows that a different architecture of practical reasoning can handle Damascus cases without feedback whiplash.\n\n8. Is there nevertheless a principled defence of CDT?\n\nOne might appeal to a \u201cfundamental principle of causality\u201d: acts cannot alter prior facts.  Since Death\u2019s prediction is in the past, the unconditional probability CDT uses is the right one; nothing else is acceptable.  If the price of that metaphysical principle is deliberative instability, so be it.\n\nYet the metaphysical intuition is honoured equally by a version of CDT that uses Pearlian interventions: evaluate Pr(S|do(A)).  When the upstream variable is statistically but not causally linked, the do-operator sets that link to zero, yielding a distribution that is entirely independent of P(A).  The resultant theory coincides with EDT\u2019s calm verdict in Damascus.  So one can keep a \u201ccausal\u201d outlook while shedding the instability.  In effect, the root cause of the oscillations is not respect for causality, but the ancillary CDT rule \u201cfor independent variables, use the unconditional probabilities already in your belief state,\u201d a rule that can be replaced.\n\n9. Lessons and verdict\n\nWe can now answer the guiding question.\n\nYes, CDT\u2019s dependence on the agent\u2019s current probabilities for her own acts is a problem.  The problem is practical, epistemic and theoretical.\n\n\u2022 Practically, an agent who follows CDT can enter infinite preference cycles, so the theory fails to supply usable guidance when guidance is most needed.\n\n\u2022 Epistemically, CDT endorses choices that are unrati\ufb01able: once the agent takes herself to have made them, she will know that by her own lights they were the wrong choices.\n\n\u2022 Theoretically, the feedback link between P(A) and EU(A) is an artefact of CDT\u2019s rule for handling upstream correlates; other decision rules that respect causal independence avoid the artefact, so it is not a benign feature of any causal view, but a removable blemish on CDT itself.\n\nTo be sure, a staunch causal decision theorist can preserve CDT by letting mixed strategies in, or by denying that ideal agents ever have self-probabilities during deliberation, or by biting the bullet on instability.  Each manoeuvre, however, extracts a cost: expanding the menu, distorting plausible doxastic dynamics, or accepting practical incoherence.  Faced with these costs, many have concluded that CDT in its classical guise is inadequate.  Whether one opts for a Pearl-style causal decision theory, a ratifiability-constrained update to CDT, or a more radical departure such as policy selection, the Death in Damascus puzzle shows that the unconditional-probability clause at the heart of CDT cannot be the last word on rational choice.\n\n10. Conclusion\n\nDeath in Damascus teaches that when predictions about our choices are only very nearly perfect, CDT ties the evaluation of an act to our moment-to-moment confidence in performing it.  That tie creates cycles and unrati\ufb01ability, and it exposes agents to sure-loss exploitation.  Because other decision theories escape these fates without sacrificing causal scruples, the dependence is best read as a flaw.  CDT, at least in its textbook formulation, therefore needs repair or replacement if it is to serve as a fully adequate guide to rational deliberation.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 2, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 3916, "reasoning_tokens": 960}

Is this dependence on act probabilities a problem for CDT, and if so, why?", "answer": "Deliberation and Fate: Should Causal Decision Theory Worry about its Sensitivity to the Agent\u2019s Own Act-Probabilities?  \n\n1. Setting the Stage  \n\nCausal Decision Theory (CDT) tells a deliberating agent to evaluate each available act A by the utility she would expect were she to perform A, weighting the possible causal predecessors of A by their unconditional probabilities.  The celebrated \u201cDeath in Damascus\u2019\u2019 scenario (from Gibbard & Harper 1978, recast by Ahmed 2014) is designed to make CDT look uncomfortable.  You have an appointment with Death tomorrow.  Death is extraordinarily good at predicting where you will go, though not perfect.  If he predicts you will be in a city, he positions himself there to meet you.  You are currently in Damascus.  If you stay, you expect him to be waiting in Damascus with very high probability; if you flee to Aleppo you expect him to have followed you there with somewhat lower probability, because\u2014so the story goes\u2014Death has a mild antecedent bias for Damascus.  (Call d the probability that Death guesses \u201cDamascus\u2019\u2019 irrespective of your eventual act; d > \u00bd.)  \n\nCrucially, the correlation between your act and Death\u2019s location is endogenous: the better you reckon Death is at prediction, the more tightly you must correlate his location with what you end up doing.  In consequence, the expected utilities of your options are sensitive to your current, in-the-moment subjective probability that you will perform them.  And those probabilities usually shift as you deliberate.  The question is whether that dependence is a defect in CDT.\n\n2. Why the Dependence Looks Puzzling  \n\nSuppose you start out leaning 70-30 toward fleeing to Aleppo.  Since you believe Death is a near-perfect predictor, you also assign roughly a 70-30 credence that he has gone to Aleppo.  Because he prefers Damascus slightly, the numbers are not exactly the same\u2014say you end up with  \n\nP(Death in Aleppo | go to Aleppo) = .97  \nP(Death in Damascus | stay in Damascus) = .995  \n\nwhile the cross-terms (Death in Aleppo | stay) and (Death in Damascus | flee) are tiny.  Let uL be the utility of living, uD that of dying, with uL \u2500 uD > 0.  For any realistic values, CDT will now tell you that the expected utility of staying put in Damascus (.005\u00b7uL + .995\u00b7uD) is worse than that of fleeing (.03\u00b7uL + .97\u00b7uD).  So CDT now recommends flight.\n\nBut the moment you take that recommendation seriously, you update: your probability of actually fleeing shoots past 70%.  Conditional coherence pushes up P(Death in Aleppo), because you think he tracks you.  Expected utility differences shrink.  Push the point far enough and a reversal threatens: if the probability of flight becomes 99%, the chance Death is already in Aleppo becomes roughly 99% as well, and Damascus regains the upper hand.  The CDT verdict swings back.  A na\u00efve CDT agent bounces like a ball between the options (\u201cAleppo is better\u2026 no, Damascus is better\u2026\u2019\u2019) and risks interminable dithering.\n\nThe bare dependence of the evaluation on P(act) does not yet show CDT is wrong.  All decision theories must describe what happens inside deliberation, and it is unremarkable that one\u2019s changing self-beliefs can move expected utilities around.  Still, many find the oscillatory pattern suspicious, and three distinct worries have been pressed:\n\n   Worry 1: Dynamic instability.  CDT seems unable to converge on a stable decision because its recommendations shift in tandem with credences that themselves respond to its recommendations.\n\n   Worry 2: Diachronic incoherence.  Even if a CDT agent eventually acts, the path to action appears to violate intuitive norms of rational belief updating: her probability for Death\u2019s whereabouts is being driven by fluctuations in an essentially self-referential proposition, namely \u201cI will go to Aleppo\u2019\u2019.\n\n   Worry 3: Exploitability or \u201cmoney-pump\u2019\u2019 vulnerability.  An external party who can make you reconsider (say by quoting a poem about Damascus every time you plump for Aleppo) can keep you churning indefinitely, extracting small costs each time and leaving you worse off overall.\n\nIf any of those worries stick, the dependence of CDT on act-probabilities threatens to be a fatal problem rather than an innocuous feature.\n\n3. The Dynamic Instability Worry  \n\nA fully worked CDT requires the agent to feed in a probability function that is already self-consistent: probabilities for propositions about her future actions must match the causal structure that she believes connects her acts to upstream states.  That means there must be a fixed point where the probability she assigns to \u201cI go to Aleppo\u2019\u2019 equals the probability that emerges after she runs the CDT calculation and chooses accordingly.  In technical terms, her credence function must be ratifiable (Joyce 1999).  If such a fixed point exists, CDT can tell a stable story: form only ratifiable credences, then act on them, and no oscillation occurs.  \n\nDoes the Death in Damascus set-up admit a fixed point?  Yes; typically there are two.  One involves certainty of staying, the other certainty of fleeing.  Take the \u201csure flight\u2019\u2019 point.  If P(Aleppo)=1, the agent must also believe Death is in Aleppo with probability \u22481 (he is almost perfect).  Expected utility is then approximately uD, identical whichever city she is in, so either act is tied.  Ties are usually resolved by indifference, and indifference is consistent with P(Aleppo)=1.  Mutatis mutandis for the \u201csure Damascus\u2019\u2019 point.  Hence CDT can defend itself: rational deliberators restrict themselves to ratifiable credence states.  Oscillation is a pathology arising only because we imagined an illicit starting point (70-30) that was not self-ratifying.\n\nTwo rejoinders are common.  First, it seems psychologically unrealistic to require agents to begin deliberation in a state that is already perfectly ratified.  Realists about bounded rationality will insist that learning often begins with partial credence in competing acts.  If CDT cannot guide such an agent without threatening paralysis, something pragmatic is amiss.  Second, tie situations leave CDT indifferent between mutually incompatible certainties.  Which one should the agent pick?  Absent an answer, the theory lapses into arbitrariness.  So dynamics matter after all.\n\n4. The Diachronic Incoherence Worry  \n\nOrthodox Bayesianism distinguishes between ordinary empirical propositions and self-referential ones about the agent\u2019s own future choices.  The latter, it is argued, should not be treated as \u201cordinary evidence\u2019\u2019 in the course of updating (Spohn 1977, Levi 1989).  An agent can choose which act to perform, not discover it.  If one buys this divide, treating \u201cmy probability of fleeing is 70%\u2019\u2019 as a piece of evidence about where Death is lurking looks illicit.  CDT\u2019s dependence on that figure therefore appears to smuggle in an impermissible form of self-locating information.\n\nThe diachronic version of the complaint is that the agent\u2019s evolving P(Death in Aleppo) is driven by nothing in the external world, only by alterations in her own act-probabilities, and hence her belief revision does not track truth.  But Bayesian orthodoxy already countenances such auto-updates whenever you deliberate under Knightian uncertainty about your own actions (see Jeffrey 1965, Skyrms 1980).  Intuitively, if you start leaning toward backing a horse, you should correspondingly raise the chance you will hold a winning ticket, even before you have moved a muscle.  Doing otherwise leaves you liable to a Dutch Book against your own preferences.  So CDT can reply: the complained-of updates are not incoherent; they are the hallmark of rational reflection.\n\n5. The Exploitability Worry  \n\nAhmed (2014) develops a money-pump in which an omniscient trickster repeatedly offers the CDT agent cheap last-minute travel vouchers to switch plans, harvesting a fee each time the agent flips.  If the trickster can time his offers to moments when CDT favours the opposite city, the agent will always pay.  When morning comes she ends up where she began, minus a pile of fees.  That is intuitively irrational.\n\nDefenders invoke again the ratifiability constraint: an agent who realises the trickster\u2019s scheme will foresee the succession of offers, factor them into her decision model, and settle at a stable credence from which CDT yields a determinate recommendation not to switch.  The dynamic incoherence is an artefact of ignoring the game-theoretic setting, not a flaw in CDT\u2019s core principles.\n\nThe exploitability debate turns on empirical assumptions about how difficult it is, psychologically, to hold ratifiable credences in the presence of very predictive opponents.  If humans inevitably wobble, perhaps rationality norms should be forgiving; but that points to a limitation of *any* theory that demands unbounded Bayesian self-control, not of CDT specifically.\n\n6. A Deeper Worry: Counterfactual Fragility  \n\nSo far we have talked about shifting probabilities during deliberation.  Another angle moots that the *very idea* of unconditional probabilities for Death\u2019s location, given an act that is strongly correlated with it, is fragile.  CDT instructs us to calculate P(Death in Aleppo | do Aleppo) as if the act could be \u201csurgically\u2019\u2019 overridden while holding fixed the causal past.  Yet in Death in Damascus the predictive success of Death arguably depends on deep facts about the agent\u2019s dispositions; to imagine her suddenly packing for Aleppo while all else stays the same may be metaphysically incoherent.  If so, CDT\u2019s core conditional\u2014\u201cthe probability of S were I to do A\u2019\u2019\u2014is ill-defined.  The dependence on act-probabilities then signals a more general counterfactual pathology: the theory asks us to evaluate conditionals whose antecedents cannot be wiggle-roomed independently of upstream correlates.\n\nThis line pushes us toward either (a) abandoning CDT in favour of something, like Evidential Decision Theory, that is explicitly correlation friendly, or (b) amending CDT so that it talks not of single-act interventions but of *policy* interventions\u2014stable dispositions that can coherently be supposed different without scrambling the whole web of correlations.  Versions of (b) include Joyce\u2019s (2012) \u201cEvidential-cautious CDT\u2019\u2019 and Menzies-Price\u2019s (1993) view that breaks causes into \u201cstructuring conditions\u2019\u2019.\n\n7. So\u2014Is the Dependence a Problem?  \n\nLet us distil the dialectic.\n\n(1) It is undeniable that, given the usual ingredients of Death in Damascus and given CDT\u2019s equations, expected utility for each act is a function of the agent\u2019s credence that she will perform it.\n\n(2) That feature can generate unstable deliberational dynamics if the agent\u2019s initial credence is not already a fixed point.\n\n(3) Such instability strikes many as counter-intuitive, and can be exploited by outside parties in stylised scenarios.  \n\nHowever:\n\n(4) The instability vanishes once we impose the ratifiability norm that is already implicit in CDT\u2019s demand for self-consistent unconditional probabilities.\n\n(5) Plausible rival theories (e.g. Evidential Decision Theory) face analogous dynamics in anthropic or \u201cpsycho-killer\u2019\u2019 cases where the evidential impact of your own decision is huge.\n\nTherefore the crux is whether ratifiability\u2014as opposed to the raw CDT calculus\u2014counts as an ad hoc repair or as an independently motivated rationality requirement.  My view is that ratifiability is well-motivated.  Incomplete, unratified credence states are not yet genuine candidates for action; they are like half-written probability functions, internally infected with a foreseen future revision.  A decision theory\u2019s job begins only once the agent has a fully coherent credence-utility pair.  On that conception, the shifting of expected utilities during the earlier, \u201cproto-deliberative\u2019\u2019 phase is not a recommendation of CDT at all; it is the agent\u2019s own attempt to arrive at such a pair.\n\nStill, the Death in Damascus case teaches an important moral.  In worlds containing superb predictors, the causal counterfactuals on which CDT relies become exquisitely sensitive to how one models the surgical intervention on one\u2019s act.  If the only coherent interventions are at the level of dispositions or mixed strategies, CDT should be reformulated accordingly.  Doing so blunts the dependence of expected utility on instantaneous act-probabilities, replacing it with dependence on the probabilities of adopting whole policies.  At that level, stable and determinate recommendations are restored.\n\n8. Conclusion  \n\nThe sensitivity of CDT\u2019s act evaluations to the agent\u2019s on-line probability of performing those very acts is, in itself, not a decisive objection.  It is a predictable by-product of (i) Bayesian coherence and (ii) CDT\u2019s usage of causal, rather than purely statistical, conditionals.  The apparent pathologies it engenders in Death in Damascus dissipate once we (a) demand ratifiable credence states and (b) acknowledge that the correct objects of causal evaluation in strongly predictive environments are policies or dispositions, not momentary choices.\n\nNonetheless the case is valuable.  It exposes a tension between two desiderata: local, act-by-act causal evaluation and global strategic stability in the face of powerful correlational feedback.  To resolve the tension, champions of CDT must articulate a richer account of counterfactual intervention or embrace policy-level, rather than act-level, decision theory.  Whether one sees that as a modification of CDT or a migration to a new theory will depend on how flexibly one reads the label \u201cCDT\u2019\u2019.  \n\nEither way, the mere dependence of expected utility on self-assignments of act-probability is not the decisive threat; the deeper lesson is about how causal reasoning must be adapted when the world contains minds reading minds.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 3, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 3653, "reasoning_tokens": 640}

In 'Death in Damascus'-style cases, where you must choose between going to Aleppo or Damascus knowing that Death awaits in whichever city he predicted you would visit (with predictions being reliable but imperfect, and Death having a tendency to guess Damascus), the utility of each act depends on your current probability that you will perform that act. This means CDT's recommendations can shift as your act probabilities change during deliberation. Is this dependence on act probabilities a problem for CDT, and if so, why?", "answer": "1. Introduction  \n\nCausal Decision Theory (CDT) is usually advertised as a theory that tells us how to choose rationally when the consequences of our acts depend only on the causal up-shots of those acts.  If you are deciding whether to pack an umbrella, CDT instructs you to compute for each alternative its expected utility with respect to the probabilities of states that are not caused by your act\u2014e.g. whether it will rain\u2014and to pick the act with highest causal expected utility.  In ordinary choice problems this procedure is silent about what probability you assign to performing the various acts under consideration.  That fits an intuitive picture of deliberation: first decide which act is best, then perform it.  In \u2018\u2018Death in Damascus\u2019\u2019\u2013style problems, however, the causal probabilities of the relevant states\u2014viz. the city in which Death is waiting\u2014depend on your own probability of acting one way rather than another.  Consequently, the causal expected utility that CDT assigns to \u2018go to Damascus\u2019 varies as your degree of confidence that you will go to Damascus varies while you deliberate.  Philosophers have worried that this sensitivity makes CDT dynamically unstable and therefore normatively defective.  The purpose of this essay is to examine whether the dependence in question is really a flaw in CDT, and, if it is, to diagnose exactly why.\n\nI shall proceed as follows.  \u00a72 sets out the Death in Damascus case and shows in detail how the causal expected utilities of the competing acts shift with changes in the agent\u2019s self-probabilities.  \u00a73 articulates three related complaints: the instability complaint, the ratifiability complaint, and the deliberation-crowding complaint.  \u00a74 defends CDT against an over-hasty version of these complaints: the mere fact that expected utilities move with self-probabilities is not yet a reductio of CDT.  \u00a75 argues, however, that when we press the dynamics of deliberation, the dependence yields a genuine incoherence: CDT violates a Reflection requirement that any plausible decision rule must satisfy.  \u00a76 sketches two ways in which a proponent of CDT might try to patch the theory\u2014(i) by adding a ratifiability constraint, and (ii) by endorsing a policy-selection or mixed-strategy version of CDT\u2014and explains why neither fix really remedies the underlying defect.  \u00a77 concludes that the dependence on self-probabilities is indeed a serious problem for orthodox CDT because it prevents the theory from underwriting stable deliberative commitment.  \n\n2. Death in Damascus and the moving target of causal expected utility  \n\nThe story, due originally to Donald Davidson and popularised by Bas van Fraassen and Bryson Brown, runs thus.  You know that the Angel of Death is after you and that he is an excellent but not perfect predictor.  If Death predicts you will go to Damascus, he will wait in Damascus; if he predicts Aleppo, he will wait in Aleppo.  You must now decide where to travel.  You also know a quantitative detail: Death guesses Damascus with prior probability 2/3 and Aleppo with probability 1/3.  Moreover, his conditional accuracy is high: if he predicts a city, the chance (from your point of view) that you will indeed go there is 0.9.  The utilities are stark: surviving the day is worth 0, dying is -1.  Travel costs and scenery don\u2019t matter.\n\nLet p be your present subjective probability that you will go to Damascus.  The causal probabilities that CDT asks you to use in computing expected utilities are the prior probabilities of the state \u2018Death waits in Damascus\u2019 conditional on your act.  However, because Death\u2019s location is generated by a predictive mechanism keyed to your act, these conditional probabilities depend on p itself:\n\nP(Damascus | go to Damascus) = 0.9 + 0.1\u00b7(1-p)           (1a)  \nP(Damascus | go to Aleppo)   = 0.1 + 0.9\u00b7p               (1b)\n\nExplanation.  If you go to Damascus, there are two routes by which Death ends up there: he predicted Damascus and you complied (probability 0.9), or he predicted Aleppo but you surprised him and went to Damascus anyway (probability 0.1\u00b7(1-p)).  A symmetric calculation yields (1b).\n\nGiven utilities Survive = 0, Die = \u20131, the causal expected utilities are just the negatives of the probabilities of meeting Death:\n\nCEU(go-Dam)  = \u2013P(Damascus | go-Dam)                     (2a)  \nCEU(go-Ale)  = \u2013P(Aleppo  | go-Ale)  = \u2013(1 \u2013 P(Damascus | go-Ale)).  (2b)\n\nSubstituting from (1a,b) we obtain\n\nCEU(go-Dam)  = \u2013[0.9 + 0.1(1-p)]       = \u20130.9 \u2013 0.1 + 0.1p = \u20131.0 + 0.1p  \nCEU(go-Ale)  = \u2013[0.1 + 0.9p]           = \u20130.1 \u2013 0.9p.\n\nThese formulae exhibit the pivotal fact: as p changes during deliberation, both expected utilities shift.  In particular,\n\n\u2022 If p < 0.5, CEU(go-Dam) < CEU(go-Ale); CDT prescribes Damascus.  \n\u2022 If p > 0.5, CEU(go-Ale) < CEU(go-Dam); CDT prescribes Aleppo.  \n\u2022 If p = 0.5, both acts tie.\n\nHence, an arbitrarily small swing in your present confidence about what you will do flips CDT\u2019s recommendation.  Nothing else in the set-up changes\u2014neither background probabilities nor utilities\u2014only your self-belief.\n\n3. Three worries about the dependence\n\n3.1 Instability.  Deliberation is a process in which you reflect on reasons and update your confidence about what you will do.  In Damascus, the very act of updating tends to make CDT\u2019s prescription oscillate.  Suppose you start unsure, p = 0.6.  Then CDT instructs you to go to Aleppo.  Recognising that you are now going to Aleppo drives p toward 0, because you become convinced that you will not go to Damascus.  Once p slips below 0.5, CDT now recommends Damascus.  Realising that you are headed for Damascus pushes p back up, making Aleppo preferable again, and so on ad infinitum.  The agent is caught in an endless cycle and never settles on an action.  Decision theory is meant to help you decide; a rule that systematically frustrates decision looks defective.\n\n3.2 Ratifiability.  Richard Jeffrey and Gregory Kavka observed that rational agents should not perform acts that they expect themselves, on reflection, to regret.  An act A is ratifiable when, conditional on deliberatively believing that one will do A, A maximises expected utility.  In the Damascus set-up neither going to Damascus nor going to Aleppo is ratifiable, because believing that one will do it makes the other act appear better.  So CDT recommends acts that cannot be ratified from the inside, violating an appealing internalist desideratum on rational choice.\n\n3.3 Deliberation crowding.  Joyce, Arntzenius, and S\u00f8renson have argued that a decision rule should respect the \u2018\u2018deliberation crowds out prediction\u2019\u2019 principle: learning facts about what you are about to do solely by introspecting your current intentions should not change which act is objectively best.  But in Death in Damascus, acquiring evidence about your own act (via self-probability drift) is the only thing that changes, and yet CDT flips verdicts.  That suggests the theory is inappropriately sensitive to one\u2019s epistemic position rather than the de re structure of the problem.\n\n4. Why the mere dependence is not by itself fatal  \n\nBefore condemning CDT we should note that any decision theory that incorporates causal correlations between an act and an external event will exhibit some dependence on the agent\u2019s self-probabilities.  Even Evidential Decision Theory (EDT) shares this feature; in fact, in Death in Damascus EDT delivers exactly the same numbers as CDT, because the only evidence you get about Death\u2019s location flows through your own action.  More generally, whenever the outcome-probabilities are generated by a predicting demon, those probabilities are conditional on what the demon expects you to do, which in turn is correlated with what you in fact do.  A theory that ignored these correlations would be causally obtuse.  So the sheer fact that CEUs vary with p cannot be a decisive objection.\n\nMoreover, we should distinguish two kinds of dependence:\n\n(i) Parameter sensitivity: the expected utility functions contain p as a parameter.  \n\n(ii) Deliberative feedback: the process of computing and responding to those expected utilities causes p itself to move, generating cycles.\n\nOnly (ii) threatens practical irrationality.  A theory could be parameter sensitive yet, once a rational agent settles on a self-probability, output a stable recommendation.  The crucial question is whether CDT\u2019s procedure forces rational agents into unstable feedback loops they cannot exit.\n\n5. CDT violates a reflection requirement\n\nTo analyse the dynamics, suppose that deliberation proceeds in time-slices t = 1, 2, 3, \u2026 .  At each slice the agent has a credence p_t that she will go to Damascus.  She applies CDT to compute CEU_t(Dam) and CEU_t(Ale).  If CEU_t(Dam) < CEU_t(Ale) she forms the intention to go to Aleppo, and vice versa.  A minimal rationality norm, Reflection (van Fraassen 1984), says that one\u2019s current credence in a proposition should equal one\u2019s expected future credence, conditional on nothing more than the passage of time.  Put differently, you should anticipate the way you will update your beliefs.  When Reflection is satisfied, beliefs and intentions form martingales, and deliberation tends toward fixed points.  In Damascus, however, any initial credence other than exactly 0.5 leads immediately to a violation of Reflection.  \n\nProof sketch.  Let p_1 > 0.5.  Then at t=1 the agent intends Aleppo, so she knows that at t=2 her credence p_2 will plummet below 0.5.  But Reflection requires p_1 = E(p_2 | info at t=1), which is impossible because p_2 is expected to be <0.5.  So the requirements of CDT force the agent into a state that is transparently epistemically incoherent.  \n\nThe underlying reason is that CDT uses as inputs unconditional probabilities that are themselves unstable under expected introspection.  In any decision problem where the outcome-probabilities depend smoothly on one\u2019s own future credence, applying CDT locally at each moment will break the martingale structure rational belief demands.  This is not just an artefact of predictor cases; similar phenomena arise in coordination games where one\u2019s move conveys information to others about one\u2019s type.  Therefore, the dependence is a genuine structural defect: CDT\u2019s advice cannot be incorporated into a single self-consistent epistemic plan.\n\n6. Can CDT be repaired?\n\n6.1 Ratifiability filter.  Joyce (1992) proposes that a rational act must both (i) maximise causal expected utility and (ii) be ratifiable.  Because neither pure act is ratifiable, the only remaining candidates are mixed strategies: e.g. flip a fair coin, go to Damascus on Heads.  Indeed, the mixed strategy that assigns probability 0.5 to each city is ratifiable; given that probability, both cities tie and the agent is content.  Adding the ratifiability filter therefore outputs \u2018randomise fifty-fifty\u2019.\n\nDoes this save CDT?  No.  First, the justification for ratifiability is itself essentially evidential: we avoid choices we would expect to regret.  Bolting that principle onto CDT blurs the clear causal\u2013evidential distinction CDT was meant to preserve.  Second, even with the filter, the decision process is fragile.  A minute deliberative perturbation away from exactly 0.5 reignites oscillation.  Third, mandating randomisation in a life-or-death scenario where a predictor is watching seems normatively suspect: after all, if Death sees the coin land Heads he can station himself accordingly; but if he cannot see the coin, then standard CDT already favoured Damascus or Aleppo depending on p, so the ratifiability move is unnecessary.  In short, ratifiability gerry-rigs CDT rather than vindicating it.\n\n6.2 Policy or mixed-act CDT.  Another idea, due to Jefferys and Skyrms, is to treat the decision problem as one of choosing entire probability distributions over acts\u2014policies\u2014rather than point acts.  In effect the agent announces, \u2018\u2018I will choose Damascus with probability q and Aleppo with 1-q.\u2019\u2019  One then computes causal expected utility for each policy and selects the q that maximises expected utility.  In Death in Damascus the policy that maximises expected utility is again q = 0.5.  Because the expected utility function over q is strictly concave, there is a unique maximum; the deliberation dynamics therefore converge to the mixed equilibrium.  Stability is restored.\n\nYet this manoeuvre changes CDT\u2019s subject-matter.  The original theory was about choosing acts; this version is about choosing probability measures over acts.  While game theorists are comfortable with mixed strategies, ordinary practical reasoners rarely are.  Moreover, the cure presupposes that the mechanism dictating Death\u2019s prediction is sensitive only to one\u2019s chosen act, not to the randomization device or the announced distribution; but in predictor cases, the demon could in principle observe the whole process.  If Death predicts the probabilities themselves, we iterate the same instability at the next level.  Thus, mixed-act CDT merely displaces the problem.\n\n7. Conclusion  \n\nWe can now answer the guiding question.  The dependence of CDT\u2019s recommendations on the agent\u2019s evolving probability of acting is a problem, not merely an eccentricity, because it defeats CDT\u2019s core practical purpose: to guide deliberation toward a stable, self-endorsing plan of action.  The dependence violates Reflection, undermines dynamic consistency, and forces agents into cycles of shifting intentions.  Attempts to patch CDT by layering ratifiability or by moving to policy choice either abandon CDT\u2019s original rationale or push the instability one step up the meta-ladder.  Hence, unless one is prepared to accept deliberative paralysis or ad hoc repairs, one must concede that orthodox CDT is inadequate for Death in Damascus\u2013style cases.  The lesson is not just parochial: any decision rule that treats one\u2019s own prospective acts as free variables while simultaneously allowing outcome probabilities to track one\u2019s beliefs about those very acts will run into the same difficulty.  The smarter moral is that rational deliberation requires a single unified fixed point of beliefs and intentions\u2014a constraint that CDT, as traditionally formulated, does not respect.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 4, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 3378, "reasoning_tokens": 192}

Introduction  \n\nCausal Decision Theory (CDT) says that rational agents should choose the available act that maximises causal expected utility.  Roughly,\n\nEUCDT(A) = \u03a3s P(s | **do**(A)) \u00b7 U(A, s)\n\nwhere A ranges over the acts under the agent\u2019s control, s over \u201cstates of the world,\u201d and P(s | do(A)) is the agent\u2019s unconditional (\u2018causal\u2019) probability that s obtains, i.e. the probability that s would obtain were A performed, holding fixed only what is causally upstream of A.  In ordinary cases CDT delivers uncontroversial advice because the probabilities of the causally independent states are insensitive to which act one will actually perform: as long as smoking does not causally affect lung cancer, P(cancer | do(smoke)) = P(cancer | do(not-smoke)).  In Newcomb-type problems, however, the act correlates with an upstream predictor, so the unconditional probabilities that go into the CDT calculation depend on the agent\u2019s own credence that she will in fact perform an act.  The \u201cDeath in Damascus\u201d story brings this feature into sharp relief.\n\n2. The Death in Damascus case  \n\nA traveller in Damascus is told by an omniscient but not infallible oracle:\n\n   \u201cDeath has predicted where you will spend tomorrow.  If he predicts Damascus, he goes to Damascus; if he predicts Aleppo, he goes to Aleppo.

Travelling costs \u03b5 > 0.  Because Death tends to guess Damascus, before deliberation you are 75 % confident that his prediction is \u201cDamascus\u201d no matter what you do, and consequently you assign 75 % credence that Death will be in Damascus.  All of that credence is upstream of your act; where you go does not send a signal back in time.  You now deliberate whether to remain in Damascus or buy a ticket to Aleppo.\n\n3. Why the numbers inside the CDT calculation move while you deliberate  \n\nLet P(A) be your current credence that you will end up going to Aleppo.  The unconditional probability that Death will be in Aleppo is the probability that he predicted Aleppo, which by reliability considerations is roughly P(A) \u00b7 r + (1\u2013P(A)) \u00b7 (1\u2013r \u2013 bias) \u2026 in short, the better you think the predictor is and the more likely you think you are to choose Aleppo, the more likely you must judge that Death foretold Aleppo.  Thus:\n\nP(Death in Aleppo) = f(P(A)).  \nP(Death in Damascus) = 1 \u2013 f(P(A)).\n\nConsequently the causal expected utilities of the acts are\n\nEUCDT(Aleppo) = \u2013\u03b5 + (1 \u2013 f(P(A)))\u00b710 + f(P(A))\u00b7(\u2013\u221e)  \nEUCDT(Damascus) = 0 + f(P(A))\u00b710 + (1 \u2013 f(P(A)))\u00b7(\u2013\u221e).\n\nBecause f is strictly increasing in P(A), EUCDT(Aleppo) is highest when P(A) is low; EUCDT(Damascus) is highest when P(A) is high.  As you reflect on what these utilities look like, you thereby alter P(A).  A familiar dynamic ensues:\n\n   \u2022 You start neutral.  You notice that if you were to stay in Damascus (P(A) \u2248 0), then the predictor probably put Death in Damascus, so going to Aleppo looks better.  \n   \u2022 On forming the intention to go to Aleppo, you raise P(A) toward 1.  Now you judge it likely that Death predicted Aleppo, so suddenly Damascus looks safer.  \n   \u2022 Switching your intention back to Damascus drops P(A), flipping the utilities again.\n\nThe agent ricochets between the options; there is no probability at which the causal expected utilities tie unless the predictor is exactly 50 % reliable and unbiased.  CDT\u2019s recommendation flips every time the agent\u2019s credence about her own future act moves, and that credence in turn moves whenever the recommendation flips.  The deliberation is unstable; no fixed point is reachable.\n\n4. Is this a defect in CDT?  \n\nA. The guidance complaint  \n\nA decision theory is supposed to guide action.  In Death in Damascus, CDT fails to issue stable advice.  At any moment it produces a recommendation, but it simultaneously guarantees that, were the agent to be guided by that recommendation, she would change her mind an instant later.  That looks like self-defeat: the outputs of the theory cannot be coherently acted upon by a deliberating agent who follows the theory\u2019s own rules for updating beliefs.\n\nThe critic need not insist that rational deliberation always terminates; but a theory that, under ideal reflection, predicts perpetual vacillation in otherwise ordinary circumstances seems ill-suited to the task of guidance.\n\nB. Dynamic (in)consistency  \n\nStandard norms of rationality require an agent to be dynamically consistent, i.e. not to ever prefer A to B while foreseeing that, immediately after adopting A, she will prefer B to A on unchanged information.  CDT in Death in Damascus forces exactly such foreseen preference reversals.  The moment the agent leans toward Aleppo she foresees that once the leaning is strong enough she will prefer Damascus.  That violates even weak forms of the \u201cprinciple of reflection\u201d (van Fraassen) or sophisticated choice consistency (Strotz, Hammond).\n\nC. Dependence on arbitrary credences about one\u2019s own act  \n\nCDT consults the unconditional probabilities of states that are not causally downstream.  But those probabilities sometimes depend on P(A) where A is the very act we are evaluating.  The numerical value of P(A) is not determined by anything outside the agent\u2019s epistemic perspective; it is whatever credence about her own future act she currently contingently has.  That looks epistemically accidental.  Two agents alike in every respect except degree of self-confidence would compute different causal expected utilities from identical background information.  Many take this to show that CDT imports a wrong kind of subjectivity: acts that are intuitively equally risky get different scores merely because the agent is more or less sure which act she is going to take.\n\nD. Exploitability considerations  \n\nIf there were bookmakers able to trade with CDT agents on the basis of their unstable preferences, the agents would be susceptible to Dutch books and money pumps: every time the preference flips, the agent would pay a small premium to switch future plans, eventually forfeiting unbounded expected utility.  Susceptibility to sure loss is widely regarded as a mark of irrationality.\n\nE. The tie-breaking retreat  \n\nDefenders sometimes reply: \u201cThe rational CDT agent should refuse to deliberate about questions that influence P(A).  She should treat her own choice as exogenous, fix P(A) at \u00bd, calculate both expected utilities, and act on the result.\u201d  But that answer deprives CDT of its selling point\u2014namely, that it tells us how to deliberate rationally given all our information.  Moreover, the rule \u201cnever update P(A)\u201d is ad hoc; there was nothing irrational in the traveller\u2019s learning about her own inclinations during honest reflection.\n\nOn balance, the dependence on act probabilities looks like a genuine difficulty for CDT.\n\n5. Can CDT be patched?  \n\nFive main repair strategies have been explored:\n\n1. Ratificationism (Eells, Jeffrey, Jackson & Pargetter)  \n   An act is rational only if it would still be chosen after taking into account the fact that it would be chosen.  Formally, A is rational if A maximises expected utility when conditionalised on the proposition that the agent chooses A.  In Death in Damascus, conditionalising on Choose-Aleppo raises the probability that Death foresaw Aleppo to near certainty, making Aleppo unattractive; conditionalising on Choose-Damascus has the symmetric effect.  No act ratifies itself, so the theory says that there is no rational option.  While avoiding oscillation, ratificationism collapses into nihilism here; many find that unacceptable.\n\n2. Fixed-point CDT (Joyce)  \n   Require that the agent\u2019s credences about her future act be such that the act they render EU-maximising is just that act.  One solves P(A) = g(P(A)), a fixed-point problem.  In Death in Damascus there is no fixed point unless the predictor is exactly 50-50.  Again, when the equations have no solution the theory is silent.\n\n3. Recombinant acts or policy selection (Gibbard & Harper, Skyrms, Yudkowsky)  \n   Instead of evaluating single-stage acts, evaluate complete policies mapping possible informational states to actions; causal probabilities are taken with respect to the policy as a whole, which is upstream of the predictor.  Then your deliberation concerns which policy to adopt, not which city to visit.  Because Death tracks tomorrow\u2019s city, not the policy, the probabilities that enter the calculation are policy-independent, curing instability.  That proposal, however, requires enlarging the option set in a way that changes CDT\u2019s content and abandons the act-centrism that originally motivated the theory.\n\n4. Two-box compliant CDT (Ahmed & Price)  \n   Augment CDT with a principle of \u201creflective equilibrium\u201d that disallows reliance on unstable self-predictions.  One variant instructs the agent to treat her own future act as causally upstream of the predictor whenever she knows the predictor\u2019s algorithm is itself sensitive to her dispositions.  But this is to move CDT in the direction of evidential decision theory, undercutting the purported advantage of causal over evidential reasoning.\n\n5. Abandon CDT for EDT or FDT  \n   Evidential Decision Theory (EDT) or the more recent Functional Decision Theory (FDT) does not condition on do(A) but on A itself (EDT) or on the algorithm that determines A (FDT).  In Death in Damascus both say \u201cGo to Aleppo; the fact that you are going correlates with Death\u2019s being there, so you want the negative correlation.\u201d  They deliver stable advice.  But CDT partisans typically reject EDT/FDT because of their performance in other cases (Smoking lesion, mechanical blackmail, etc.).\n\n6. Is the problem unique to improbable predictor scenarios?  \n\nSome defenders note that perfectly rational agents are fully self-predictable, so their self-credences should always be either 0 or 1, not intermediate.  If P(A) is 0 or 1, EUCDT(A) is well-defined and stable.  The oscillation arises only for decision makers who are uncertain about their own future act.  But real human agents invariably are uncertain.  A decision theory that works only for idealised perfect predictors of themselves is at best incomplete.\n\nFurthermore, there are ordinary everyday situations\u2014e.g., choosing whether to grab an umbrella when the weather forecast may have used CCTV to gauge how many umbrellas commuters are carrying\u2014in which one\u2019s action is correlated with a past predictor yet one reasonably harbours mixed credences about which act one will perform.  CDT\u2019s instability then matters in practice.\n\n7. Does the instability reflect a deep truth about rational agency?  \n\nA radical interpretation holds that the oscillation is not a bug but an insight: whenever the world contains powerful predictors of our behaviour, we are caught in strategic interaction with them, and the correct rational play may indeed lack a pure-strategy equilibrium.  The \u201coscillating\u201d CDT agent approximates the mixed-strategy equilibria known from game theory.  On this reading, the agent should randomise; what looks like vacillation is simply the internal implementation of a mixed strategy.\n\nYet the CDT computation does not recommend a particular probability mix; it makes recommendations that flip unboundedly fast, not the measured indifference of a mixed-strategy equilibrium.  Moreover, Death in Damascus is not a game of simultaneous choice but one of prediction; the mixed-strategy analysis therefore lacks a clear foundation.\n\n8. Philosophical upshot  \n\nThe Death in Damascus instability exploits a structural feature of CDT: by purging evidential relations that run through your own choice, CDT forces the probabilities of downstream outcomes to be evaluated in terms of how likely they would be if you performed A.  But in predictor cases, the non-causal correlation between A and the target state is mediated precisely by the fact that you will perform A.  Hence CDT must consult P(A), and as P(A) moves the evaluation moves with it.  Unless the P(A) dependence can be eliminated or rendered stable, CDT will violate the basic desideratum that a decision theory provide consistent, action-guiding prescriptions.\n\nOne might try to live with the difficulty, arguing that genuine rationality sometimes is dynamically unstable.  Yet most philosophers, including many defenders of CDT in other debates, judge that rationality should at least permit convergence under ideal deliberation.  The Death in Damascus case shows that unmodified CDT fails that test.\n\n9. Conclusion  \n\nYes, the dependence of CDT\u2019s advice on the agent\u2019s evolving act probabilities is a problem.  It makes the theory:\n\n   \u2022 practically non-guiding, because deliberation never converges;  \n   \u2022 dynamically inconsistent, forcing foreseeable preference reversals;  \n   \u2022 epistemically arbitrary, letting momentary self-confidence sway expected utilities; and  \n   \u2022 prey to exploitability.\n\nAttempts to patch the theory either (a) deprive CDT of its distinctive causal flavour, (b) yield silence in predictor cases, or (c) import new ad hoc constraints on deliberation.  The most promising fixes in effect abandon act-centred CDT for policy-centred or evidential relatives.\n\nFor those who regard stability and action-guidance as non-negotiable criteria of rational choice, Death in Damascus is fatal to classical CDT.  At minimum it shows that any defensible causal decision theory must be supplemented with an account of self-locating credence and policy selection that prevents expected utilities from riding on the very probabilities that the agent is in the act of settling.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 5, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 3408, "reasoning_tokens": 384}
{"question_id": "GALLOW-CAUSALDECISIONTHEORISTS-2020", "question": "Causal Decision Theory (CDT) evaluates acts by their expected utility, calculated using unconditional probabilities for states not causally downstream of your act. In 'Death in Damascus'-style cases, where you must choose between going to Aleppo or Damascus knowing that Death awaits in whichever city he predicted you would visit (with predictions being reliable but imperfect, and Death having a tendency to guess Damascus), the utility of each act depends on your current probability that you will perform that act. This means CDT's recommendations can shift as your act probabilities change during deliberation. Is this dependence on act probabilities a problem for CDT, and if so, why?", "answer": "1.\u2003Introduction: the case and the worry\n\nCausal Decision Theory (CDT) characterises the value of an act A as the sum of the utilities of possible states S weighted by the probabilities P(S\u2502do A) that those states would obtain were A performed.  A central selling-point of CDT is that it tells the agent to ignore merely evidential correlations between her act and earlier, causally independent events.  In Newcomb\u2019s problem, for example, CDT directs you to two-box because, holding fixed what you do, the money is already in the opaque box or it is not.  \n\n\u2018Death in Damascus\u2019 (van Fraassen 1984; Gibbard & Harper 1978) is intended to turn that virtue against CDT.  Death is an uncanny but fallible predictor of human travel plans.  He is already waiting in whichever of two cities, Damascus or Aleppo, he has predicted you will visit tomorrow.  If you meet him you die; if you avoid him you live.  You now have to choose where to go.\n\nBecause Death\u2019s reliability is high but not perfect, the unconditional probability that he is now in Damascus depends on your current credence that you will in fact go to Damascus: if you think you are likely to go to Damascus you should also think it likely that Death predicted as much and is waiting there.  Conversely, if in the course of deliberation you start leaning towards Aleppo your credence that Death is in Aleppo should rise.  CDT therefore instructs you to calculate the expected utility of each act with probabilities that shift as your own probability of performing that act shifts.  It can consequently deliver changing, indeed oscillating, recommendations while you deliberate.  Is that a defect of the theory?  I shall argue that it is.\n\nThe discussion proceeds in four steps.  (\u00a72) I make the dependence on act-probabilities explicit with a simple model. (\u00a73) I explain why that dependence threatens CDT\u2019s ability to give stable and action-guiding advice. (\u00a74) I consider three popular responses on behalf of CDT and explain why each is unsatisfactory. (\u00a75) I generalise the moral: the problem is not local to \u2018Death in Damascus\u2019 but reveals a structural instability in orthodox CDT whenever an agent\u2019s credence in her own act is evidentially relevant to pay-offs.  I conclude that CDT, as usually formulated, must be revised or replaced.\n\n2.\u2003Why the numbers shift\n\nSuppose Death\u2019s reliability is 0.9 and, when he is uncertain, he is disposed to guess Damascus.  More precisely,\n\nP(Death guesses correctly) = 0.9  \nIf you will go to Damascus, P(Death in Damascus) = 0.9.  \nIf you will go to Aleppo, P(Death in Damascus) = 0.1.\n\nLet q be your present subjective probability that you will go to Damascus.  Because Death\u2019s prediction was made before you contemplated the problem, nothing you now do can causally influence where he is.  CDT therefore instructs you to use the unconditional probability that Death is in Damascus, which by the law of total probability is\n\nP(Death in Damascus) = 0.9 q + 0.1 (1 \u2013 q) = 0.1 + 0.8 q.\u2003(1)\n\nSince you live if and only if you avoid Death, the expected utility (in lives saved) of going to Damascus is\n\nEU(Damascus) = 1 \u2013 P(Death in Damascus) = 0.9 \u2013 0.8 q.\u2003(2)\n\nBy parallel reasoning the expected utility of going to Aleppo is\n\nEU(Aleppo) = 0.1 + 0.8 q.\u2003(3)\n\nThe two expected\u2010utility lines are graphed in Figure 1: they are straight lines with opposite slopes that cross at q = 0.5.  If, at some point in deliberation, you assign q > 0.5, equation (2) makes Damascus look worse than Aleppo, so CDT tells you to head for Aleppo; if q < 0.5 CDT says go to Damascus; if q = 0.5 CDT is indifferent.\n\nBut now notice the feedback loop.  Suppose you start with q = 0.6.  CDT then tells you to go to Aleppo.  Recognising that you are about to commit to Aleppo will drive your credence that you will go to Damascus down; perhaps you revise q to 0.4.  With q = 0.4, (2) says Damascus is now safer, so you switch your intention to Damascus, which pushes q back above 0.5, and round you go again.  Nothing external changes; only your self-locating credence does; yet CDT\u2019s recommendation flips incessantly.\n\n3.\u2003Why that is a problem\n\na.  Advice that defeats deliberation  \nA decision theory is supposed to guide an agent from uncertainty about what to do to a definite act.  CDT\u2019s guidance here is self-undermining.  As soon as the agent forms an intention the theory uses that very fact as input to overturn its own advice.  Deliberation degenerates into an infinite regress, or, if decision must be made at a fixed deadline, into an essentially arbitrary tie-breaker.  That is not mere pedagogical discomfort; it violates what Bratman (1999) calls the stability constraint on practical reasoning: a rational plan should tend to resist reconsideration in the absence of new external information.\n\nb.  Dependence on a purely endogenous magnitude  \nExpected utility should depend on how the world might turn out, not on the agent\u2019s fleeting second-order beliefs about which act she will choose.  Consider two psychologists hidden in adjacent rooms, each running through exactly the same explicit reasoning but with different unspoken hunches about what they will do.  CDT, as modelled above, can decree that act A is rational for one and act B is rational for the other, even though their evidence about the external world is identical.  That looks uncomfortably like making rationality hinge on an introspective whim.\n\nc.  Dynamic inconsistency and money-pump vulnerability  \nBecause the agent\u2019s preference ordering changes predictably with her own shifting intentions, a cunning third party could exploit her.  Offer her, each time the pendulum swings to Damascus, the option to pay a small fee to lock that choice in; once locked in, the expected utility calculation flips, so she will pay again to unlock it\u2014and so on, trading herself into the ground.  The possibility of a guaranteed sure-loss sequence of voluntary trades shows that the underlying preference pattern is dynamically inconsistent (McClennen 1990).\n\nd.  Violation of reflection  \nAccording to van Fraassen\u2019s Reflection Principle, your future probability assignments, conditional on your anticipation of them, should constrain your present probabilities.  CDT in this case violates Reflection in the following sense: you know that if you were to come to be certain of going to Damascus you would take Aleppo to be safer, and vice versa, yet you cannot anticipate ever reaching a stable credence that you can endorse now.  That undermines the coherence of your overall epistemic state, and coherence is one of CDT\u2019s own classical justifications.\n\nHence there is a genuine difficulty, not a merely psychological nuisance: CDT fails to issue coherent and stable prescriptions in circumstances it can foresee and in which other plausible theories (e.g. \u2018Evidential Decision Theory\u2019 or \u2018Policy-based CDT\u2019) do not melt down.\n\n4.\u2003Can the causal decision theorist evade the problem?\n\nResponse 1.  The \u2018end-of-deliberation\u2019 defence  \nJoyce (1999) suggests that act probabilities are well defined only at the end of deliberation, when they collapse to 0 or 1.  At that point CDT will recommend Damascus if you finally choose Damascus and Aleppo if you finally choose Aleppo; so there is no oscillation.  But that is unhelpful ex ante.  The theory is being appealed to precisely in order to reach the end of deliberation; telling the agent that CDT will agree with whatever choice she lands on removes the normative content.  Moreover, the defence does not generalise to mixed strategies deliberately chosen, e.g. spinning a coin; in mixed strategies the relevant act probabilities are not 0 or 1 even at the moment of choice.\n\nResponse 2.  Treat the choice variable as causally downstream  \nOne might object that the earlier calculation mistakenly treats Death\u2019s location as causally independent of your present decision, whereas in truth your decision today is evidence about your earlier mental processes, which in turn partly caused Death\u2019s prediction.  But CDT\u2019s charter was precisely to insulate decisions from such purely evidential links.  Once we allow backward-directed evidential influence to count as causal for decision purposes, CDT collapses into Evidential Decision Theory, losing the very feature that let it two-box in Newcomb\u2019s problem.\n\nResponse 3.  Ratificationism  \nJeffrey and Skyrms propose that a rational act should be one that would remain the preferred act even after you learned that you had decided to perform it.  In formal terms, an act A is ratifiable if A maximises expected utility conditional on the information \u2018I shall do A\u2019.  In Death in Damascus no pure act is ratifiable: learning you will go to Damascus makes Aleppo preferable and vice versa.  The only ratifiable option is a mixed strategy that makes your probability of going to each city equal, breaking the link with Death\u2019s asymmetric prior bias.  Ratificationism therefore avoids instability, but only by demanding randomisation in a situation where, intuitively, one city\u2014Aleppo\u2014is genuinely safer given Death\u2019s predilection for Damascus.  So ratification fixes the stability defect at the cost of sometimes issuing recommendations (expensive randomisation devices, etc.) that strike many philosophers as over-sophisticated and counter-intuitive.\n\n5.\u2003The general moral\n\nThe problem is not limited to quirky prediction tales.  Any scenario with the following three features will trigger the same instability:\n\n1.  The utility of an act A depends on some state S not causally downstream of A.  \n2.  The agent believes that S is probabilistically correlated with her choice of A.  \n3.  The strength of that correlation is itself a function of her credence that she will choose A.\n\nExamples abound in social choice, bargaining, and self-locating belief.  In cooperative dilemmas, for instance, your inclination to cooperate is evidence that your counterpart, who can often read the same subtle situational cues you rely on, will also cooperate.  CDT under conditions (1)\u2013(3) becomes sensitive to transitory, essentially endogenous mental states and therefore fails the basic convergence requirement for a decision procedure.\n\nNotice also that the instability has nothing to do with indeterminism.  Even if human choice were physically deterministic, as long as the agent is uncertain about what she will do she faces the same self-referential loop.\n\nThus the dependence of CDT\u2019s expected-utility numbers on the agent\u2019s shifting act-probabilities is not an innocuous artefact; it prevents CDT from functioning as a practicable theory of rational action.\n\n6.\u2003Conclusion: what next?\n\nWe have seen that, in Death-in-Damascus cases, the causal decision theorist\u2019s expected-utility calculation treats a purely inner, deliberative magnitude\u2014the agent\u2019s credence in her own act\u2014as an input variable, with the result that the theory\u2019s advice cannot stabilise.  That violates several core norms of agency: action-guidance, dynamic consistency, introspective indifference, and the Reflection principle.  Three putative repairs\u2014waiting until credences collapse to 0/1, redescribing evidential dependence as causal, and adopting ratificationism\u2014each save part of CDT\u2019s spirit at the cost of abandoning other parts or delivering dubious prescriptions.  \n\nAccordingly, the dependence on act-probabilities is indeed a serious problem for orthodox CDT.  If we wish to retain the causal insight that only downstream effects should matter, we must reconceive the unit of choice (perhaps as a whole policy rather than a single act) or adopt a hybrid theory that allows limited evidential feedback without re-introducing Newcombian anomalies.

This means CDT's recommendations can shift as your act probabilities change during deliberation. Is this dependence on act probabilities a problem for CDT, and if so, why?", "answer": "1. Introduction  \n\nCausal Decision Theory (CDT) was forged to avoid the counter-intuitive prescriptions of Evidential Decision Theory in Newcomb-type problems.  Its core principle is simple: when deciding, ignore mere evidence about what will happen and attend only to what your choice can causally influence.  The expected utility of an act A is therefore calculated with probabilities that are unconditional on A for any state S that is not causally downstream of A.  In ordinary cases this recipe works smoothly, but the Death in Damascus story forces us to notice something easily overlooked: the unconditional probability of a state often depends on the agent\u2019s own probability of performing the act.  Once that dependence is acknowledged, CDT\u2019s recommendations can flip back and forth as the agent\u2019s deliberative credences migrate.  Is that a vice in the theory?  I shall argue that it is a serious, though not necessarily fatal, difficulty because it frustrates CDT\u2019s aim of giving determinate, action-guiding advice to a reflective deliberator.  I then examine and find wanting several strategies CDT-defenders have proposed to defuse the worry.\n\n2. The Death in Damascus set-up  \n\nA traveller must decide whether to go to Aleppo or Damascus.  Death, a reasonably but not perfectly reliable predictor, will travel to whichever city he predicts the traveller will choose; if he meets the traveller, the traveller dies.  We are told two further details.  First, Death is more prone to guess Damascus than Aleppo\u2014say, ceteris paribus he guesses Damascus with probability .6.  Second, his reliability is high but imperfect\u2014suppose that conditional on his guessing the city you actually go to, his success rate is .9 (and .1 otherwise).  \n\nRepresent the acts as A (go to Aleppo) and D (go to Damascus).  The crucial feature is that the unconditional probability that Death is in Aleppo equals the probability that he both guessed Aleppo and was right, which depends on your probability of choosing Aleppo, call it p.  For concreteness:\n\nP(Death in Aleppo) = .6(1\u2013p)(.1) + .4p(.9).  \nP(Death in Damascus) = .6(1\u2013p)(.9) + .4p(.1).\n\nYour utility if you meet Death is \u2013100; if you avoid him, +0 (the cities are otherwise equally attractive).  Expected utility therefore becomes:\n\nEU(A) = \u2013100 \u00d7 P(Death in Aleppo).  \nEU(D) = \u2013100 \u00d7 P(Death in Damascus).\n\nNotice that P(Death in Aleppo) is an increasing function of p, whereas P(Death in Damascus) is a decreasing function of p.  Thus if, when you start deliberating, you assign p = .1, EU(A) is low (Death probably waits in Damascus, where you are unlikely to go) and CDT advises Aleppo; but if you begin with p = .9, EU(D) is higher (Death now likely waits in Aleppo), so CDT prescribes Damascus.  In between there is a fixed point\u2014roughly p = .5\u2014at which the two expected utilities tie.  If during reflection you drift across that knife-edge, CDT\u2019s verdict reverses.  The recommendations are sensitive to one\u2019s endogenous probability of acting.\n\n3. Why that sensitivity looks worrying  \n\nA decision theory is supposed to guide deliberation.  A theory that treats its own output as a moving target seems unable to get deliberation started, for the advice it issues at t1 may evaporate by t2 once the agent\u2019s brain notices the advice and updates her act-probabilities.  The problem recurs:\n\nStep 1: \u201cGiven my current credence p = .3 of choosing Aleppo, Aleppo maximises causal expected utility.\u201d  \nStep 2: \u201cBut recognising Step 1 pushes p toward 1, for I now lean strongly to Aleppo.\u201d  \nStep 3: \u201cGiven p \u2248 1, Damascus maximises causal expected utility.\u201d  \nStep 4: \u201cRecognising Step 3 pushes p back toward 0 \u2026\u201d\n\nNothing in CDT blocks this oscillation.  The agent, treated as a perfect expected-utility calculator, becomes trapped in a deliberative churning.  That threatens two desiderata:\n\na. Action guidance: A decision theory should tell a reflective agent what to do, not merely what would be best conditional on whichever unstable credence she happens to have.  \n\nb. Diachronic rationality: Rationality should not demand that an agent intend simultaneously incompatible acts at successive fine-grained moments of reflection.  CDT seems to court such diachronic incoherence.\n\n4. A familiar analogue: ratifiability  \n\nThe phenomenon is structurally identical to the problem Richard Jeffrey and Allan Gibbard called \u2018ratifiability.\u2019  An act is ratifiable if, after conditionalising on the information that you are going to perform it, you would still want to perform it.  In Death in Damascus no act is ratifiable unless your act-probabilities sit exactly at the fixed point; that dependence is what fuels instability.  Jeffrey concluded that rational choice requires picking a ratifiable act, but CDT by itself gives no guarantee that a ratifiable option exists or is uniquely favored.\n\n5. First attempted defence: \u201cSo what?  CDT just reports the facts.\u201d  \n\nA CDT-defender might reply: the theory is not in the business of micro-managing your deliberation.  It tells you, relative to whatever unconditional probabilities you in fact have, what causally promotes your ends.  If those probabilities change, of course the recommendation may change, but that is no more puzzling than an economist\u2019s advice changing when market conditions change.  \n\nThis reply misses the mark.  Market conditions are external to the agent\u2019s act; here the probabilities that shift are themselves functions of the advice.  Because recognising the advice is causally upstream of the act, CDT\u2019s recommendations are self-referential in a way that sabotages their capacity to settle the matter.  The oscillation is not an incidental feature of exotic cases; it flows from CDT\u2019s central clause, which instructs us to evaluate acts against unconditional probabilities that themselves depend on the agent\u2019s current credences about her act.\n\n6. Second defence: \u201cTreat act-probabilities as 0 or 1.\u201d  \n\nDavid Lewis proposes that a rational agent at the moment of decision should regard her chosen act as certain: once deliberation culminates in choice, P(A) is 1 for whichever act she in fact performs.  On that proposal CDT never compares acts at intermediate credences and therefore delivers a determinate answer: whichever city you end up picking must, ex hypothesi, have been optimal given credence 1.  \n\nThe manoeuvre is question-begging.  It presupposes that deliberation can legitimately jump to certainty without justification.  But why should a rational agent snap to P(A) = 1 rather than P(A) = 0?  In Death in Damascus both limiting distributions are available.  Lewis\u2019s rule merely suppresses the instability by fiat, renouncing CDT\u2019s promise to ground choice in prior beliefs.\n\n7. Third defence: ratifiability or equilibrium constraints  \n\nAnother response is to supplement CDT with a ratifiability condition: choose an act only if, conditional on the information that you are going to do it, you still prefer it.  Equivalently, seek a fixed point of the mapping from act to deliberatively updated preferences.  In Death in Damascus, that requires the agent to set p at the equilibrium where EU(A) = EU(D).  CDT then becomes stable.  Yet the cure is worse than the disease.  \n\nFirst, nothing within CDT yields that extra norm; it is an extraneous rationality requirement grafted on to repair an inadequacy.  Second, equilibria may fail to exist or may not be unique.  Third, even when a unique equilibrium exists (as here), ratifiability can mandate acts that are dominated by feasible alternatives.  Gibbard and Harper\u2019s Wizard example illustrates a case in which only a sub-optimal act is ratifiable.  A decision theory that demands taking dominated options cannot be the last word on rationality.\n\n8. Fourth defence: model additional nodes  \n\nPerhaps the defect lies not in CDT but in a crude causal model.  If we treat the agent\u2019s \u2018decision variable\u2019 as causally upstream of both the act and Death\u2019s prediction, we can condition on that variable instead.  Then Death\u2019s location becomes independent of the ultimate act, and CDT yields the intuitively correct recommendation (\u2018choose Aleppo, because Death\u2019s bias toward Damascus makes Aleppo safer\u2019).  \n\nWhile more sophisticated causal modelling sometimes rescues CDT, in Death in Damascus the proposal backfires.  The variable \u2018my decision\u2019 is precisely what is at issue; its distribution is just the contentious p.  Plugging it into the graph re-introduces the same instability at one remove.  One can always add further upstream nodes\u2014\u201cmy subconscious intention,\u201d \u201cthe neuronal firing pattern at t\u2013\u03b5\u201d\u2014but unless some stage is exogenously fixed, the worrisome self-dependence re-emerges.  CDT offers no principled way to identify an ultimate exogenous choice-variable.\n\n9. Why the problem is serious  \n\nWe can now articulate the objection more clearly.  CDT is meant to capture instrumental rationality: choose the act with the highest causal expected utility, calculated relative to the agent\u2019s total current beliefs.  In Death in Damascus, the total belief state includes a probability distribution over the very acts being evaluated.  Because the expected-utility ordering of the acts is itself a function of that distribution, the theory becomes:\n\n(i) circular\u2014my grounds for choosing A depend on how firmly I already believe I will choose A;  \n(ii) unstable\u2014small, epistemically irrelevant perturbations in p can flip the ranking;  \n(iii) action-unguiding\u2014the procedure does not converge to a recommendation from generic starting points.\n\nA parallel can be drawn with decision procedures that condition on unreliable self-locating evidence, leading to Dutch Book vulnerabilities.  The CDT agent here is dutch-bookable: a clever bookmaker could exploit her oscillations by offering conditional bets tied to momentary credences.  That is at odds with the money-pump avoidance rationale that originally motivated expected-utility decision theories.\n\n10. Is the phenomenon confined to exotic predictor cases?  \n\nOne might concede the instability yet dismiss the scenario as philosophically irrelevant\u2014after all, real-world predictors are never so artfully correlated with our choices.  The concession is too quick.  Any situation where an outside observer forms expectations that correlate (imperfectly) with our action\u2014stock markets anticipating a firm\u2019s investment, political opponents guessing a negotiator\u2019s strategy, romantic partners predicting each other\u2019s next move\u2014instantiates the same structure.  The agent\u2019s unconditional probabilities about the observer\u2019s behavior will typically be sensitive to her own inclinations.  So the instability is not a laboratory curiosity; it shadows decision-making wherever one\u2019s intentions are legible to others.\n\n11. A better moral: shift from act-probabilities to policy-probabilities  \n\nOne promising revisionary idea is to index expected utility not to acts but to complete policies, where a policy specifies what the agent would do in each possible information state.  The policy you pick at the start of deliberation is under your direct rational control; the particular act performed is then determined by the policy together with the information realised.  Because the policy itself need not covary with the act probabilities inside the decision problem, the circular dependence evaporates.  \n\nImplementing the proposal, however, would require CDT to forsake its simple act-level maxim and adopt the more complicated schema of Functional Decision Theory or Updateless Decision Theory, which weigh subjunctive dependencies between policies and predicted outcomes.  That shift retains the spirit of causal reasoning but abandons the letter of traditional CDT.  In effect, recognising the Death in Damascus instability pushes us beyond CDT to a newer, policy-based framework.\n\n12. Conclusion  \n\nThe dependence of CDT\u2019s recommendations on the agent\u2019s current act-probabilities is not a benign quirk.  It undermines CDT\u2019s claim to provide stable, context-invariant guidance for reflective deliberators.  Attempts to dismiss the difficulty either assume away deliberation, import extraneous ratifiability norms, or relocate the instability without resolving it.  The root of the problem is CDT\u2019s act-based criterion, which leaves it entangled in self-referential credences whenever others can predict the act.  A satisfactory decision theory should instead evaluate policies or choice-mechanisms whose probabilities are not themselves hostage to moment-by-moment shifts in deliberation.  Unless CDT is re-engineered along those lines, the Death in Damascus case exposes a genuine, deep-seated flaw in the theory.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 7, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 3169, "reasoning_tokens": 448}
{"question_id": "GALLOW-CAUSALDECISIONTHEORISTS-2020", "question": "Causal Decision Theory (CDT) evaluates acts by their expected utility, calculated using unconditional probabilities for states not causally downstream of your act. In 'Death in Damascus'-style cases, where you must choose between going to Aleppo or Damascus knowing that Death awaits in whichever city he predicted you would visit (with predictions being reliable but imperfect, and Death having a tendency to guess Damascus), the utility of each act depends on your current probability that you will perform that act. This means CDT's recommendations can shift as your act probabilities change during deliberation. Is this dependence on act probabilities a problem for CDT, and if so, why?", "answer": "Causal Decision Theory (CDT) tells a deliberating agent to choose the act that maximises causal expected utility.  To calculate that figure, the agent is instructed to imagine performing the act by means of a \u201cdo\u2010operator\u201d (an intervention that sets the act\u2019s value), to hold fixed every variable that is not causally downstream of that intervention, and then to take an expectation with respect to the resulting probability distribution.  When the causal graph is uncomplicated, this procedure delivers clear, stable advice.  Trouble arises, however, in cases where (i) some earlier predictor has formed a fairly accurate opinion about what the agent will do, (ii) the world is arranged so that the agent\u2019s prospects depend on that prediction, yet (iii) that predictor\u2019s opinion is not itself causally downstream of the act.  \u201cDeath in Damascus\u201d is the paradigm.\n\n1.  The case and CDT\u2019s recipe\n\nThe story has four salient variables.\n\nA   \u2208 {Aleppo, Damascus} \u2013 the act you will in fact perform tomorrow.  \nL   \u2208 {Aleppo, Damascus} \u2013 the location at which Death will be waiting for you tomorrow.  \nS   \u2208 {live, die} \u2013 survival.  S = live iff A \u2260 L.  \nU   = utility.  Normalise to 0 for death, 1 for survival.\n\nDeath chooses L before you decide, attempting to predict A.  He is highly reliable \u2013 say 90 % \u2013 but not perfect, and he has a mild bias for guessing Damascus when in doubt.  For definiteness, let  \n\n   P(L = Dam | A = Dam) = .9,   \n   P(L = Dam | A = Aleppo) = .2.\n\nThese numbers are ex ante chances fixed by the mechanism that produces Death\u2019s prediction; they do not themselves vary as you deliberate.  CDT therefore says:\n\nEU(Aleppo) = P(S = live | do (Aleppo)) = 1 \u2212 P(L = Aleppo | do (Aleppo)),  \nEU(Damascus) = 1 \u2212 P(L = Damascus | do (Damascus)).\n\nBecause L is chosen before your act and is not causally downstream of it, the conditional \u201c| do(A = x)\u201d simply deletes the outgoing arrows of A while leaving L distributed exactly as above, with probabilities that depend only on the actual but not\u2010yet\u2010realised value of A.  Formally,\n\nP(L = Dam | do (Aleppo)) = .2,   \nP(L = Alep | do (Damascus)) = .1.\n\nThose numbers appear to give the straightforward recommendation: go to Aleppo (EU = .8) rather than Damascus (EU = .9 survival risk, hence EU = .1).  So where\u2019s the fuss?\n\n2.  Why the utilities seem to depend on your current credence in A\n\nThe worry begins once we notice that the model just sketched is not yet complete from the point of view of a deliberating agent.  An omniscient spectator can attach a single sharp objective chance to \u201cA = Aleppo,\u201d but you, the agent, are trying to decide which city to visit.  As you deliberate, you form \u2013 and revise \u2013 a subjective probability P*(A = Aleppo).  That subjective probability is relevant because your current mental state is one of the cues Death\u2019s predictor used when he formed his earlier judgment.  The more confident you now are that you will go to Damascus, the more confident you should also be that Death headed for Damascus.  More precisely, you typically accept\n\nP(L = Dam | A-probability p) = .9p + .2(1 \u2013 p).\n\nThat is the same formula we wrote above but with the objective chance \u201cp = P(Aleppo)\u201d replaced by your own live estimate of that chance.  Insert that function into the EU calculation and you obtain\n\nEU(Aleppo) = 1 \u2013 [.9(1\u2212p) + .2p] = .1 + .7p,  \nEU(Damascus) = 1 \u2013 [.9p + .2(1\u2212p)] = .8 \u2013 .7p.\n\nThe expected utilities are affine functions of p with opposite slopes.  When p < .5, Aleppo\u2019s EU (.1 + .7p) is less than Damascus\u2019s (.8 \u2013 .7p); when p > .5, the inequality reverses.  Consequently CDT\u2019s ranking flips at p = .5.  But your own probability p is hardly fixed: it is precisely what you are in the process of settling.  A tiny shift of credence across the .5 boundary makes the theory swing from \u201cDamascus is mandated\u201d to \u201cAleppo is mandated.\u201d  That, in turn, shifts your intention, which in turn shifts your credence, which flips the recommendation back, and so on.  The upshot is an endlessly oscillating piece of advice \u2013 exactly the \u201cinstability\u201d that has bothered many commentators since Richter\u2019s original statement of the puzzle.\n\n3.  The instability spelled out\n\nSuppose you start the evening thinking you are 70 % likely to flee to Damascus.  Then:\n\np = .7 \u2192 EU(Dam) = .8 \u2013 .7(.7) = .31,  \nEU(Alep) = .1 + .7(.7) = .59.\n\nSo CDT orders you to go to Aleppo.  Recognising that injunction, however, pushes your subjective p sharply downwards.  Perhaps your posterior is now p = .3.  Recompute:\n\np = .3 \u2192 EU(Dam) = .8 \u2013 .7(.3) = .59,  \nEU(Alep) = .1 + .7(.3) = .31.\n\nNow Damascus is favoured.  Your probability of Damascus surges; the ranking re-flips.  Nothing stabilises.  If we idealise your reasoning as perfectly precise and instantaneous, there is literally no fixed point: for every p other than .5 the act ranking is the reverse of what would be needed to keep p in place, and at p = .5 the outcomes are tied, leaving CDT with no strict recommendation at all.\n\n4.  Why this looks like a problem\n\nA decision theory is supposed to be action-guiding: it should be able to issue a recommendation that the agent can publicly commit to and carry out.  CDT in Death-in-Damascus fails to meet that criterion.  It does not merely say \u201cthe options are tied\u201d (which would be acceptable indecision).  Rather, it makes its own guidance depend on a number the agent cannot keep fixed while attending rationally to that very guidance.  The advice is self-undermining.\n\nIn addition, the oscillation implies dynamic inconsistency.  A principle of rational deliberation, endorsed by most decision theorists, is that if you are about to perform an act A because you take it to maximise expected utility, you should not expect yourself, seconds hence, still to be deliberating between A and some rival B on grounds that A has ceased to look best.  Yet CDT tells you precisely that in Death-in-Damascus: commit to Aleppo and you thereby acquire evidence making Damascus look better, so you must plan to rethink; commit to Damascus and you must plan to rethink again.  No coherent executable plan is possible.\n\nFinally, the dependence of utilities on act-probabilities violates a more abstract desideratum: separability.  One would like a decision rule to rank acts by features of the acts and of the environment that are themselves independent of which act is going to be chosen.  CDT is usually advertised as enjoying exactly that virtue: unlike Evidential Decision Theory, it cares only about the causal consequences of the act, not about what the act evidentially indicates.  But here CDT\u2019s ranking is controlled by p, which is nothing but evidence about which act is going to be chosen.  In this setting CDT slides toward the very evidentialism it was designed to avoid, yet in a way that prevents it from providing stable guidance.\n\n5.  Can CDT escape?\n\nSeveral responses are available to the causal theorist.  Each incurs its own cost.\n\n5.1  \u201cFix the probabilities ex ante\u201d\n\nOne might insist that the probabilities used in the EU calculation are not the agent\u2019s shifting credences but the objective chances that obtain prior to deliberation.  Perhaps, an hour ago, before you focused attention on the problem, the chances were: P(Aleppo) = .5 by symmetry; hence EU(Alep) = EU(Dam) = .45.  Those numbers stay put; deliberation must not treat its own evolving partial resolutions as evidence.  In effect, you refuse to conditionalise on information about your present intention.\n\nThe difficulty is motivational.  Rational agents normally do learn from introspection.  If while deciding you become 80 % sure you will chicken out and stay in Damascus, it is irrational to continue to attach only 50 % credence to that very proposition.  Forbidding an agent to use readily available information about her own forthcoming behaviour looks ad hoc.\n\n5.2  \u201cDeliberation crowds out prediction\u201d\n\nA related line, found in David Lewis and in Stalnaker, emphasises that the predictor is finished and gone; Death\u2019s location L is already set.  During deliberation you therefore cannot influence L; you can only learn something about it.  Since the objective chance of L is now fixed, the true probabilities in the EU formula are insensitive to how your credence in A fluctuates.  Hence the instability is merely epistemic, not practical.\n\nBut in Death-in-Damascus the predictor\u2019s reliability depended precisely on the accessibility of your then current mental state \u2013 the one you occupy right now.  Introspection lets you acquire new evidence about what the predictor saw.  So it is no mere epistemic mirage; your changing self-knowledge really is correlated with L.  CDT itself licences conditionalisation on any earlier event that is not downstream of the do-operator, and the contents of your own head are such an event.  Lewis\u2019s \u201ccrowding out\u201d therefore conflicts with CDT\u2019s own unconditionalising instruction.\n\n5.3  \u201cTreat the problem at the policy level\u201d\n\nSome causal decision theorists move from act evaluation to policy evaluation.  Instead of asking \u201cAleppo or Damascus?\u201d they ask \u201cadopt the policy of going where Death least expects, or adopt some other policy?\u201d  A policy is chosen now, and CDT is applied to that choice.  Because \u201cchoice of policy\u201d stands well upstream of Death\u2019s prediction, no backwards correlation arises.\n\nThe move helps here but not in general.  By stretching the decision variable far enough back in time one can always push more and more of the world into one\u2019s causal future, making CDT\u2019s unconditional probabilities stable.  Doing so, however, robs CDT of the very methodological clarity that made it attractive: the clean link between local acts and local causal consequences.  In addition, the policy that maximises causal EU in Death-in-Damascus is \u201center a randomiser and follow its output,\u201d which feels like a merely technical fix rather than a vindication of causal reasoning.\n\n5.4  \u201cReplace CDT\u201d\n\nMany philosophers take Death-in-Damascus style instability as one more datum favouring alternative theories \u2013 most prominently Functional Decision Theory (FDT) or Updateless Decision Theory (UDT).  Those theories evaluate an act by holding fixed not only the act\u2019s causal consequences but also the subjunctive implications of the algorithm that produced it.  In our case, they say \u201cIf the decision algorithm outputs Aleppo, Death almost certainly predicted Aleppo; so Aleppo spells doom.  If it outputs Damascus, Death probably predicted that; again doom.  Since either output gives the same value, you may pick arbitrarily or flip a coin.\u201d  The recommendation is well defined and unchanging.\n\n6.  Assessing the balance\n\nDoes the instability we have charted amount to a fatal objection to CDT?  Three criteria are relevant.\n\n(1) Action guidance: A satisfactory decision rule must yield stable advice an agent can implement.  \n(2) Evidentiality: The rule should not let its verdict vary with purely evidential correlations it purports to ignore.  \n(3) Dynamic consistency: Rankings issued at time t should not systematically undermine themselves at t+1.\n\nOn all three counts, CDT misfires in Death-in-Damascus unless its proponent adopts one of the auxiliary strategies sketched in \u00a75.  Yet each strategy abandons something central \u2013 introspective learning, the neat causal recipe, or the theory itself.  That looks like a serious defect.\n\n7.  Objections answered\n\n\u201cAha,\u201d says the causalist, \u201cyour instability is an artefact of idealisation.  Real people\u2019s credences are never so precise that an infinitesimal update flips a practical verdict.\u201d  True, but what matters is not behavioural smoothness but the theory\u2019s prescriptions for perfectly ideal agents.  A standard of rational choice should not place an upper bound on cognitive acuity merely to save itself.\n\n\u201cIt is not CDT\u2019s job to tame self-predictive feedback; that is a special epistemic difficulty.\u201d  Again, CDT officially instructs agents to use their best unconditional probabilities of states not downstream of the act.  In self-referential settings, those probabilities are ipso facto sensitive to the agent\u2019s evolving perspective; so the difficulty is endogenous to CDT.\n\n8.  Conclusion\n\nThe dependence of CDT\u2019s recommendations on act-probabilities in Death-in-Damascus is indeed a problem.  It drives the theory into an oscillating, self-defeating pattern of advice, undermines action guidance, violates dynamic consistency, and reintroduces an evidential flavour that CDT was meant to exclude.  The defender of CDT can respond only by restricting agents\u2019 use of introspection, by shifting the level of choice so far upstream that the phenomenon disappears, or by embracing a different decision theory altogether.  None of these manoeuvres is cost-free; the second and third amount to abandoning core tenets of CDT.

The setting\n\nThe Death in Damascus puzzle is purposely simple. The world contains only two salient variables.\n\n     A  \u2208 { go to Damascus, go to Aleppo }                        (your act)\n     D  \u2208 { Death in Damascus, Death in Aleppo }                  (where Death is)\n\nIf you and Death end up in the same city, you die (utility = \u20131).  \nIf you end up in different cities, you live (utility = +1).\n\nDeath has made his choice before your deliberation finishes.

Formally, let\n\n     r  =  Pr(D = same city as you)  =  reliability of prediction     (0.5 < r < 1)\n     b  =  Pr(Death guesses Damascus when he guesses wrongly)         (0 \u2264 b \u2264 1)\n\nTo bring out the instability, fix numbers: r = .9 and b = .8.  So when Death is right he is right 90 % of the time, and when he is wrong he tends to pick Damascus four times out of five.\n\n2. How CDT computes the options\n\nCausal Decision Theory instructs you to evaluate each possible act A = a by the expected utility it would cause, using probabilities for variables that are not causally downstream of the act but are nonetheless uncertain.  In Death in Damascus the location of Death is not causally affected by where you finally go \u2013 his decision is already made \u2013 so CDT tells you to compute\n\n     V(a)  =  EU(A = a)  =  (+1)\u00b7Pr(D \u2260 a)  +  (\u20131)\u00b7Pr(D = a)\n\nand then choose whichever act has the larger V-value.\n\nWhere do the probabilities in that formula come from?  CDT prescribes the unconditional probabilities \u2013 the ones you hold in your actual epistemic state \u2013 because, speaking causally, the act makes no difference to D.  But those unconditional probabilities are strongly correlated with how likely you currently think you are to go to each city, exactly because Death is a good predictor.\n\nLet  p  =  Pr(A = Damascus)  be your present, pre-choice credence that you will end up in Damascus.  Basic probability and the reliability figures give\n\n     Pr(D = Damascus)  =  r\u00b7p  +  (1\u2013r)\u00b7b\u00b7(1\u2013p)                 (1)\n     Pr(D = Aleppo)    =  r\u00b7(1\u2013p) +  (1\u2013r)\u00b7(1\u2013b)\u00b7p               (2)\n\nPlugging (1)\u2013(2) into the value formula yields\n\n     V(Damascus)  =  (1\u20132\u00b7Pr(D=Damascus))\n                   =  1 \u2013 2[r\u00b7p + (1\u2013r)\u00b7b\u00b7(1\u2013p)]                (3)\n\n     V(Aleppo)    =  1 \u2013 2[r\u00b7(1\u2013p) + (1\u2013r)(1\u2013b)p]               (4)\n\nNotice the crucial fact: both V(Damascus) and V(Aleppo) are functions of p.  \nShift your credence about your own future act, and the expected utilities \u2013 hence CDT\u2019s prescription \u2013 shift along with it.\n\n3.

Suppose you begin the evening thinking p = .7.\n\n     1. Since p > p*, CDT says \u201cgo to Aleppo\u201d.\n     2. Recognising that advice, you lower p; now perhaps p = .3.\n     3. But then p < p*, so CDT reverses itself: \u201cgo to Damascus\u201d.\n     4. You raise p again; and the cycle repeats.\n\nBecause your credence p is endogenous to your deliberation, no stable recommendation is ever reached.  In Ahmed\u2019s vivid phrase, CDT becomes \u201cunmoored\u201d.  Something that calls itself a decision theory seems unable to tell you what to decide.\n\n4. Why the dependence looks troubling\n\nA. Guidance failure  \nA normative decision theory is supposed to guide action here and now.  That requires a determinate mapping from an agent\u2019s total epistemic state to a choice.  If small, predictable variations in that very state wipe away the mapping, the theory offers no usable guidance.  CDT in Death in Damascus exhibits exactly that pathology.\n\nB. Circularity  \nTo apply CDT you need the unconditional probabilities of states not downstream of the act.  Yet those unconditional probabilities are themselves calculated by conditioning on your current best guess about what you will do.  Deliberation therefore feeds back into the inputs of the value formula whose output is supposed to settle deliberation.  That is a straightforward circularity: the output variable appears, unacknowledged, among the inputs.\n\nC. Dynamic inconsistency  \nSuppose, heroically, you execute CDT literally.  At each instant you pick the act with the higher V-value relative to that instant\u2019s p, implement it, and treat the decision as final.  Because your p drifts while you think, a CDT-following agent will flip-flop \u2013 drive halfway to Damascus, change her mind, turn toward Aleppo, change again, ad infinitum.  She is dynamically inconsistent even though her preferences never change.\n\nD. Ratifiability problem  \nJeffrey proposed that rational choices should be \u201cratifiable\u201d: the act you choose must remain the act that maximises expected utility once you know that you have chosen it.  In Death in Damascus, no mixed act (p strictly between 0 and 1) is ratifiable; only the extremal options p = 0 or p = 1 are.  CDT therefore pushes you toward dogmatic self-certain choices on pain of violating its own insistence on ratifiability.  That looks epistemically perverse: why must rational agents feel certain about what they will decide before they have decided?\n\nE. Sensitivity to irrelevant mental parameters  \nWhether you assign yourself 52 % or 48 % credence of going to Damascus may reflect trivial features: what neurological noise the fMRI picked up, what time you glanced at the clock.  It is hard to see how such gossamer facts should alter which concrete city you ought to flee to when Death is in pursuit.  Yet CDT says they do.\n\n5. Is there a rescue line for CDT?\n\nDefenders of CDT have tried three main responses.\n\nResponse 1: \u201cIgnore self-locating probabilities.\u201d  \nOne can decree that rational deliberators should treat their own future act as causally open and therefore assign it no probability until the moment of choice.  Call this the \u201c0/0 view\u201d: before the decision both Pr(A = Damascus) and Pr(A = Aleppo) are undefined, so the dependence shown above never arises.\n\nThe difficulty is that perfectly ordinary Bayesian updating obliges you to have some credence distribution over any proposition you recognise is meaningful.  Treating A as probability-free makes your epistemic state non-Bayesian, and CDT is meant to be a Bayesian decision theory.\n\nResponse 2: \u201cAdopt a ratifiable credence.\u201d  \nA second idea is to pick a fixed point of the value-equations: choose the credence p that makes the act with that credence best.  In our numerical example p* \u2248 .515 is such a fixed point; commit to p* and the oscillation ceases.\n\nBut p* prescribes a mixed act: \u201cgo to Damascus with probability 51.5 %, otherwise to Aleppo\u201d.  Unless you already own a true random-number generator and are willing to let it steer your very footsteps, that advice is unusable.  In realistic cases agents do not possess the hardware needed to realise the mixed strategy that ratifies itself.\n\nResponse 3: \u201cCDT only cares about ex ante priors.\u201d  \nOne might insist that the relevant unconditional probabilities are those you had before deliberation started.  Snapshot the priors, feed them to CDT once, obtain a recommendation, and stick to it no matter how your self-locating credences shift afterwards.\n\nTechnically that avoids the loop.  But it means the very first, arbitrary tremor in your unreflective priors fixes an irrevocable decision.  If you were initially almost indifferent and then, on calm reflection, became convinced that you are almost certainly headed to Damascus, the theory refuses to let you change your mind, for the inputs are frozen.  That sits poorly with the intuition that better, later evidence should be allowed to matter.\n\n6. Two deeper reasons the dependence is fatal\n\n(i) Lack of separability.  \nIn ordinary causal modelling we hold that if X is not causally downstream of A, then Pr(X) is determined by background factors B that screen-off A.  Therefore Pr(X) should not change merely because the agent gains information about A.  CDT in Death in Damascus violates this separability assumption.  The reason is that the agent\u2019s epistemic access to her own dispositions is itself a conduit of information about X.  A theory that ignores that epistemic conduit misclassifies which variables are effectively \u201cdownstream\u201d.\n\n(ii) Mislocated notion of control.  \nCDT is built around the idea \u201ccontrol what you can causally influence\u201d.  Yet an agent\u2019s probability of acting one way rather than another is something she can influence immediately, by shifting attention or resolve.  So it is not causally inert.  When CDT treats p as exogenous, it mislocates the boundary of agential control, thereby producing ill-defined choice situations.\n\nFormal theories that do locate the boundary correctly \u2013 Functional Decision Theory (FDT) or Updateless Decision Theory (UDT) \u2013 evaluate acts by considering the consequences of the abstract decision function they implement, not of the act-token they finally take.  As a result their recommendations in Death in Damascus do not depend on p and remain stable: go to Aleppo, because the decision process that chooses Aleppo causes Death to predict Damascus often enough to make Aleppo safer.  Whatever one thinks of those rival theories, their very possibility shows that CDT\u2019s dependence on p is not inevitable.\n\n7. Putting it together\n\nThe dependence of CDT\u2019s output on the agent\u2019s live credence in her own act is worrisome for three interconnected reasons.\n\n1. Pragmatic: It deprives the theory of action-guidance by generating deliberative oscillation.\n\n2. Epistemic: It forces agents either to violate Bayesian norms (by having no credence in their own act), or to embrace dogmatic certainty for the sake of ratifiability, or to freeze their priors against later evidence.  None of these options is epistemically attractive.\n\n3. Theoretical: It exposes an internal tension between CDT\u2019s causal creed (\u201cuse probabilities for things your action cannot influence\u201d) and the epistemic reality that learning about your likely action is often the best way to learn about those very things.  The theory\u2019s instructions presuppose that the two kinds of learning come apart, but in Death-like cases they inseparably intertwine.\n\nA decision theory that fails on guidance, pulls against Bayesian epistemology, and relies on an independence that patently does not hold in cases with reliable predictors seems seriously compromised.  The defect is not cosmetic; it stems from CDT\u2019s core commitment to evaluate acts in causal isolation from the decision process that selects them.  When the world contains devices that predict that very process, isolation is impossible, and CDT\u2019s dependence on p is the visible symptom.\n\n8. Conclusion\n\nYes, the dependence of CDT\u2019s recommendations on the agent\u2019s evolving probability of performing the very act under evaluation is a problem \u2013 arguably a fatal one.  It produces circular deliberation, undermines the theory\u2019s practical guidance, and reveals that CDT\u2019s method for importing probabilities into expected-utility calculations misrepresents causal structure in predictor-laden environments.  Until CDT is revised so that its prescriptions are insensitive to trivial flux in self-locating credence, or until it supplies a principled way to fix those credences that does not violate Bayesian norms, it remains ill-equipped to handle Death in Damascus and related cases.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 9, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 4235, "reasoning_tokens": 1408}
{"question_id": "GALLOW-CAUSALDECISIONTHEORISTS-2020", "question": "Causal Decision Theory (CDT) evaluates acts by their expected utility, calculated using unconditional probabilities for states not causally downstream of your act. In 'Death in Damascus'-style cases, where you must choose between going to Aleppo or Damascus knowing that Death awaits in whichever city he predicted you would visit (with predictions being reliable but imperfect, and Death having a tendency to guess Damascus), the utility of each act depends on your current probability that you will perform that act. This means CDT's recommendations can shift as your act probabilities change during deliberation. Is this dependence on act probabilities a problem for CDT, and if so, why?", "answer": "1. Introduction  \n\nCausal Decision Theory (CDT) is, at bottom, a recipe for selecting the act that maximises expected utility when the expectation is taken with respect to probabilities of outcomes that are not causally downstream of the act.  In ordinary choice situations this prescription appears both intuitive and stable: one attaches probabilities to states of the world, utilities to the possible consequence-pairs \u27e8act, state\u27e9, computes each act\u2019s expected utility, and picks the act with the highest score.  Trouble begins, however, in so-called \u201cself-referential\u201d choices\u2014situations in which the utility of an act is itself a function of the agent\u2019s current credence that she will perform that very act.  The classic Death in Damascus case belongs to that family.  When probabilities of states depend upon what the agent thinks she is going to do, the CDT machinery can generate shifting, even oscillating, recommendations as the agent updates on her own unfolding deliberation.  Many philosophers have therefore asked whether CDT\u2019s sensitivity to these doxastic oscillations is a flaw in the theory, and if so, how deep a flaw it is.  \n\nMy aim is to say that the dependence on act probabilities is indeed a serious problem for (standard) CDT.  First, I shall rehearse the Death in Damascus set-up in enough detail to make vivid the moving parts and to show exactly where the self-reference arises (\u00a72).  Second, I argue that CDT\u2019s dependence on interim credences undermines three desiderata any decision theory should respect: (i) deliberative stability, (ii) action-guidance, and (iii) diachronic rationality (\u00a73).  Third, I consider and rebut two prominent replies on behalf of CDT\u2014appeals to (A) the doctrine of ratifiability and (B) a \u201cstage-setting\u201d conception of deliberation (\u00a74).  I close by sketching the broader moral: solving the Death in Damascus puzzle pushes us either towards some form of Evidential Decision Theory (EDT) or towards new hybrid theories that \u201cscrub out\u201d an agent\u2019s higher-order uncertainty about her own act from the evidential base used in expected-utility calculations (\u00a75).\n\n2. Death in Damascus and the Self-Referential Utility Table  \n\n2.1 The basic story  \n\nDeath, a moderately reliable predictor but not infallible, is waiting in whichever city he has predicted you will visit tomorrow.  You may either remain in Damascus or flee to Aleppo.  Let p be the unconditional probability, from Death\u2019s point of view, that he predicts Damascus; assume p > 0.5.  Let \u03b5 be the (small) probability that Death guesses wrong.  Your utilities are simple: survival is worth 0 utils, death is \u20131000 utils, and the minor costs of travel are negligible.  Under CDT you must compute for each act A \u2208 {stay in Damascus, flee to Aleppo} the expected utility  \nEU(A) = \u03a3s P(s | do(A)) \u00b7 U(A, s),  \nwhere the sum ranges over states not causally downstream of A.  Here the relevant state is \u201cDeath predicted Damascus\u201d (call it D) or \u201cDeath predicted Aleppo\u201d (\u00acD).  \n\n2.2 Where the self-reference creeps in  \n\nWhy should your credence that Death predicted Damascus depend on your credence that you will go to Damascus?  Because Death\u2019s predictions are themselves based on facts\u2014including psychological facts\u2014about you.  If, while deliberating, you come to regard going to Damascus as extremely unlikely, you should correspondingly reduce the probability that Death has predicted Damascus.  And vice versa.  The simplest way to model this is by letting  \n\nP(D) = p \u00b7 q + (1 \u2013 p) \u00b7 (1 \u2013 q) + noise,\n\nwhere q is the agent\u2019s current credence that she will go to Damascus and \u201cnoise\u201d represents the possibility \u03b5 that Death mispredicts.  The exact functional form is not crucial; what matters is that as the agent\u2019s doxastic state shifts during deliberation, her conditional probabilities P(D | do(Damascus)) and P(D | do(Aleppo)) will move in tandem.\n\n2.3 The instability  \n\nSuppose you start unbiased: q = 0.5.  Because p > 0.5, you initially assign P(D | do(Damascus)) > P(D | do(Aleppo)), hence EU(Aleppo) > EU(Damascus).  CDT says: go to Aleppo.  But the moment you resolve to flee, your credence that you will go to Damascus collapses, so you now judge that Death very probably predicted Aleppo.  This in turn lowers the expected utility of Aleppo, perhaps to the point where Damascus is now preferable.  Noticing this, you start to reconsider.  As you reconsider, your credence of ending up in Damascus rises, and with it so does P(D | do(Damascus)); the expected utilities flip again.  The upshot is a decision rule that chases its own tail.\n\n3. Three Problems Generated by the Dependence on Act Probabilities  \n\n3.1 Deliberative instability  \n\nA choice procedure is deliberatively unstable when the very act of applying the procedure predictably upends its own recommendations.  CDT in Death-style cases has exactly this property: computing EU(A) changes the probabilities feeding into that very computation, thereby changing the result.  A rational choice rule should settle deliberation, not inflame it.  Otherwise we get sorites-like infinite oscillations or, more realistically, arbitrary resolution by brute psychological fatigue rather than normative force.\n\n3.2 Loss of action-guidance  \n\nA decision theory is useless if, at the moment of action, it cannot tell you what to do.  In Death in Damascus, CDT can generate live period-by-period advice like \u201cIf you\u2019re about to go to Damascus, go to Aleppo; but if you\u2019re about to go to Aleppo, go to Damascus.\u201d  That is not guidance; it is a regress.  Worse, the regress infects any institutional implementation of CDT.  Imagine an AI agent running CDT routines that update millisecond by millisecond: without an added \u201ccommitment device\u201d the program would strobe between Aleppo and Damascus until an external interrupt forced execution.\n\n3.3 Diachronic incoherence  \n\nArguably, rationality requires a kind of diachronic coherence: your time-sliced selves should not foreseeably disagree in ways that lead to predictable losses.  But CDT\u2019s recommendations depend on transient credences about its own output, so earlier selves cannot rely on later selves to follow CDT once they have updated.  In the long run, this can be shown to generate so-called \u201cmoney pump\u201d or Dutch book vulnerabilities (see Briggs 2010).  An agent who will predictably flip choices can be exploited by an informed bettor who offers sequential bets on where she will end up.\n\n4. Two Pro-CDT Replies and Why They Fail  \n\n4.1 The ratifiability manoeuvre  \n\nJeffrey (1983) suggested that rational agents should only choose acts that are \u201cratifiable\u201d: an act is ratifiable just in case, having chosen it, the agent would not regret the choice on the basis of the very beliefs that choice would engender.  In Death-like cases, neither Aleppo nor Damascus is ratifiable, so the theory withholds recommendation.  Hitchcock (1996) and Joyce (2012) push this line: the decision theory is not at fault; the scenario is one in which no act is ratifiably maximal.\n\nYet this response undermines the ambitions of CDT.  For one, it empties the theory of prescriptive force in precisely the puzzling cases where guidance is needed most.  Second, ratifiability is cheap: any agent free to tweak her credences can make almost any act unratifiable, e.g. by vowing to form beliefs after acting that make her regret.  Third, in simpler Newcomb-style cases, forbidding unratifiable acts rules out two-box\u00ading, thereby sliding CDT surreptitiously into the camp of EDT\u2014an outcome most CDT defenders reject.\n\n4.2 The \u201cstage-setting\u201d conception of deliberation  \n\nAnother move says: treat the agent\u2019s current act-probabilities as fixed parameters during each \u201cstage\u201d of deliberation, so at stage n the agent asks \u201cGiven that I am \u03b1-likely to do Damascus, which act is best?\u201d and then updates to stage n + 1 with (possibly) new \u03b1\u2032.  On this picture, CDT does not flip-flop at a single stage; instead, the agent marches through a sequence of determinate recommendations until she reaches a fixed point \u03b1* where the recommendations stabilise.\n\nThe difficulty is that in realistic Death cases no fixed point exists except in measure-zero circumstances (e.g., \u03b5 = 0).  Any \u03b1 that makes Aleppo look best causes \u03b1 to jump, which in turn makes Damascus best, which sends \u03b1 back, ad infinitum.  Without a fixed point, the stage-setting version leaves the agent in permanent limbo.\n\nMoreover, the stage-delimiter itself is ad hoc.  Why say the agent is forbidden from taking into account the predictable updates her very next cognitive micro-events will bring?  Such blindness violates the requirement that the agent use all available information, including information about her own cognitive dynamics.\n\n5. The Larger Moral: Beyond Standard CDT  \n\nThe pathology exposed by Death in Damascus is not a mere technicality.  The very spirit of CDT is to quarantine the deliberative act from the evidential bearings that act\u2019s probability has on the world.  But when the act\u2019s probability is part of what determines upstream states (via predictors, rival agents, future selves, etc.), the quarantine collapses.  The result is either paralysis or oscillation.\n\nOne moral is that the CDT/EDT dichotomy is too crude.  We need decision rules that:  \n  (i) rely on causal structure (so as not to over-weight \u201cspurious\u201d evidential correlations); but  \n  (ii) also treat facts about our own dispositions, credences, and likely actions as legitimate evidence about the world when those facts are indeed correlated with outcome-relevant states.\n\nSeveral hybrid theories attempt to satisfy both desiderata.  Joyce\u2019s (2012) \u201ccausal\u2010evidential\u201d model lets the agent use probabilities from whatever of her own psychological states are causally upstream of the act; Skyrms\u2019s (1990) deliberation dynamics framework adds an equilibrium condition akin to Nash equilibrium; and the burgeoning literature on \u201cpolicy selection\u201d (Yudkowsky & Soares 2017) chooses whole policies rather than moment-ary acts, thereby side-stepping self-referential flip-flops.  Each of these approaches recognises that the root defect lies in CDT\u2019s refusal to let probabilities of acts serve as ordinary evidence about the pre-act world.\n\n6. Conclusion  \n\nStandard CDT\u2019s dependence on act probabilities in Death-style cases is not a benign quirk but a genuine defect.  It violates deliberative stability, betrays the action-guidance function of decision theory, and breeds diachronic incoherence that a clever opponent can exploit.  Ratifiability and staged deliberation attempts do not rescue CDT without draining it of its distinctive content.  A more adequate decision theory must integrate, rather than ignore, the evidential significance of an agent\u2019s own dispositions and deliberative states.  Whether that integration takes the form of EDT, a causal-evidential hybrid, or a policy-level criterion is an open research frontier; what is clear is that unmodified CDT cannot cope with Death in Damascus.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 10, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 2594, "reasoning_tokens": 64}
{"question_id": "GALLOW-CAUSALDECISIONTHEORISTS-2020", "question": "Causal Decision Theory (CDT) evaluates acts by their expected utility, calculated using unconditional probabilities for states not causally downstream of your act. In 'Death in Damascus'-style cases, where you must choose between going to Aleppo or Damascus knowing that Death awaits in whichever city he predicted you would visit (with predictions being reliable but imperfect, and Death having a tendency to guess Damascus), the utility of each act depends on your current probability that you will perform that act. This means CDT's recommendations can shift as your act probabilities change during deliberation. Is this dependence on act probabilities a problem for CDT, and if so, why?", "answer": "1. The setting  \n\n\u2018Death in Damascus\u2019 (due to Gibbard & Harper 1978) is by now a familiar companion to Newcomb-type problems. You have two options, go to Aleppo or go to Damascus. Death, who is almost perfectly reliable, has already predicted which city you will choose and has positioned himself in that city. You strongly prefer life to death, and you have no other reason to favour either town. You also know one further empirical regularity: when Death is uncertain he shows a slight bias for predicting Damascus.  \n\nLet the utilities be:\n\nLife = 0  \nDeath = \u22121000.  \n\nLet p be your current subjective probability that you will in fact go to Damascus (so 1 \u2212 p is the probability you will go to Aleppo). Let \u03b5 > 0 be Death\u2019s bias for guessing Damascus when the evidence is exactly balanced. Then, given the reliability of the prediction mechanism, the conditional probability that Death will be in Damascus, were you to go to Damascus, is high (say 0.99); the conditional probability that he will be in Damascus, were you to go to Aleppo, is only the small bias \u03b5. Expressed in the usual CDT notation:\n\nEU(Damascus) = \u22121000 \u00d7 0.99 \u2248 \u2212990  \nEU(Aleppo)   = \u22121000 \u00d7 \u03b5.\n\nSo far, Aleppo is the clear winner. But that was calculated on the supposition that you really might still go to either city. CDT tells you to pick the act with greater causal expected utility. The trouble begins when you try to follow that advice.  \n\nSuppose you see the above numbers and resolve to head for Aleppo. In that very moment your own probability p that you will go to Damascus plummets. But Death\u2019s method for predicting you is sensitive (let us stipulate) to exactly that probability: the more decisively you opt for Aleppo, the more confidently Death predicts Aleppo instead of Damascus. After all, Death is picking up on the same evidential cues about your deliberation that persuaded you. Consequently the conditional probabilities that figured in the earlier calculation shift. Now, given your newly firm resolve, the subjunctive probability that Death would be in Aleppo if you went to Aleppo is nearly 0.99, and the chance he would be in Damascus if you went to Damascus is merely \u03b5. Re-calculating:\n\nEU(Damascus \u2013 second pass) = \u22121000 \u00d7 \u03b5  \nEU(Aleppo \u2013 second pass)   = \u22121000 \u00d7 0.99.\n\nSo the moment you finish deciding for Aleppo it becomes rational, by the same CDT lights, to switch to Damascus! Of course the same dance will repeat if you now decide for Damascus. CDT appears to generate an endless oscillation or, at best, compel you to search for a mixed strategy (roughly p = 0.5) that is a fixed point of the dependency. That picture\u2014of your choice-probabilities feeding back into the causal probabilities and thus into the very criterion by which you choose\u2014is what motivates the worry: does the dependence of CDT\u2019s recommendations on your shifting act-probabilities show that something is amiss with CDT?\n\n2. Why CDT cares about those probabilities in the first place  \n\nThe central idea of CDT is simple: evaluate each act by the expected utility of the possible causal outcomes that would obtain were you to perform that act. To operationalise the idea we need conditional probabilities P(Outcome | do(Act))\u2014not ordinary evidential probabilities but \u2018subjunctive\u2019, \u2018causal\u2019 or \u2018interventionist\u2019 probabilities. In uncomplicated cases those probabilities are entirely independent of the agent\u2019s current credence that she will perform the act. The probability that turning the key would start the car, conditional on turning the key, is taken to be a simple matter of how ignition systems work, not a function of how likely you think you are to turn the key.\n\nHowever, two wrinkles complicate the Death in Damascus scenario.\n\na) There is a highly reliable predictor whose method is to exploit whatever information is available about your dispositions.  \nb) You, the agent, know that fact and you are perfectly rational: as your credence in choosing any given act changes, you update your model of what information is available to Death.\n\nBecause Death\u2019s presence in a city is not causally downstream of your act\u2014it is fixed before you move\u2014the causal probabilities legitimately depend on what evidence Death had, and that evidence includes any reliable clue to how the deliberation is concluding. In effect, P(Death in Damascus | do(Damascus)) really is near 1 if you are in fact extremely likely to do Damascus, but it can fall below \u00bd if you become extremely likely to do Aleppo. So the conditional probabilities are not exogenous; they vary with your own act-probabilities.\n\n3. The instability phenomenon  \n\nPut schematically:\n\nEU(D) = u(Death) \u00d7 q(p)  \nEU(A) = u(Death) \u00d7 r(p),\n\nwhere q(p) is the probability Death is in Damascus given you do D and given that your present credence in doing D is p; r(p) is the analogous probability conditional on A. Under plausible assumptions q is increasing in p and r is decreasing in p. When p is small, EU(D) > EU(A); when p is large, EU(A) > EU(D). The point p* at which they tie is a fixed point. If you are at any p \u2260 p*, CDT instructs you to move away from it, but as soon as you move CDT instructs you to move back. Hence cycles or oscillation.\n\nWhy is that a problem? Three lines of criticism have been advanced.\n\n3.1 Practical guidance  \nA decision theory is supposed to help agents decide. Cycling forever is not deciding. If following CDT literally causes deliberation never to terminate, CDT flunks the action-guidance test.  \n\n3.2 Dynamic or diachronic inconsistency  \nSuppose there is some small cost to delaying departure (e.g., the last bus leaves at noon). The oscillation wastes time and resources. An agent who accepts CDT at t\u2081 but knows she will still be a CDT-agent at t\u2082 can predict that she will reverse herself, so she now prefers to pre-commit to whatever avoids the oscillation. But CDT provides no license for such pre-commitment, because at each moment shifting is preferred. That kind of time inconsistency is taken by some to reveal irrationality in the rule.\n\n3.3 The \u2018wrong kind\u2019 of dependence  \nIntuitively, whether Death is waiting in Damascus should not depend on the gossamer psychological fact of exactly how probable you, the agent, currently take Damascus to be\u2014at least not in the way CDT is forced to acknowledge. The worry is that CDT has made the act/outcome partition too fine-grained: by making the causal probability conditional on your whole belief state it has smuggled the agent, qua deliberator, back into the state description, undoing the point of separating act from state.\n\n4. Is the complaint decisive?  \n\nFriends of CDT have replied along two main avenues.\n\n4.1 The \u2018Nickel\u2019s worth of wisdom\u2019 defence  \nDavid Lewis, Joyce and others stress that CDT is a decision rule, not a deliberation procedure. The rule is: pick the act with greatest causal expected utility. The rule makes no mention of how you come to learn what the relevant probabilities are. In normal life we compute them once, sufficiently early, and then act. If you insist on re-computing after every flicker of inclination you are misusing the rule. The right implementation is: use your prior, pre-deliberative probability p\u2080 that you will go to Damascus. p\u2080 may be 0.5; maybe it is 0.4; whatever it is, plug it in, compute EU once, and go. On that reading CDT does not generate oscillation; you do.\n\nThis reply invites two rejoinders. First, why privilege the \u2018pre-deliberative\u2019 credence p\u2080? If CDT tells me that, conditional on going to Aleppo, Death will almost surely be there, and that is news I did not previously incorporate, why should I ignore it? Second, consider an ideally reflective agent who begins at p\u2080, instantaneously performs the CDT calculation, and thereby learns that going to Aleppo is best. A microsecond later the same perfectly reflective agent recognises that, conditional on her now firming up for Aleppo, Death will learn that fact and appear in Aleppo. Stability is lost even in the limit of ideal reflection.\n\n4.2 Ratifiability and mixed strategies  \nJeffrey, Skyrms and Harper introduce the notion of a ratifiable decision: an act is ratifiable if, after you learn that you will perform that act, CDT still recommends it. In Death in Damascus the only ratifiable choice is a mixed strategy that leaves Death guessing\u2014roughly p = \u00bd. CDT thus counsels randomisation. If you can truly toss a fair coin undetectably, EU(D) = EU(A) = \u2212500, whereas any pure strategy hands Death the sure kill. In that light the instability is not a bug but a feature: the oscillation is your deliberative system groping for the unique ratifiable plan, viz. a 50-50 mixture.\n\nThis line mitigates the guidance objection: CDT does tell you what to do\u2014adopt the mixed strategy. But it faces its own criticisms.\n\na) Are mixed strategies always feasible? You must be able to flip a coin that Death cannot observe, otherwise the Predictor will merely predict the outcome of the flip.  \n\nb) Even if randomisation is feasible, is \u2212500 the best one can do? Evidential Decision Theory (EDT) says, \u2018go to Damascus\u2019 (because seeing yourself go to Damascus is good evidence that Death predicted Damascus; since Death picks the same city you do, you will probably live). In the classic variant EDT seems to yield 0 expected disutility, beating CDT\u2019s \u2212500. CDT partisans will of course dispute EDT\u2019s reasoning, but the mere fact that the ratifiable CDT recommendation is dominated under a plausible rival theory re-ignites the worry that CDT misfires.\n\n5. Diagnosing the heart of the matter  \n\nI submit that the deepest source of discomfort is neither the practical oscillation nor the mixed-strategy verdict in itself. It is that the causal probabilities are allowed to depend on a datum\u2014the subjective probability of the very act under evaluation\u2014that an ordinary causal model would treat as an artefact of the modelling process, not as a variable in the world.\n\nImagine drawing the usual directed acyclic graph. There are nodes for your underlying preference, for your deliberation procedure, for the act (which city to visit), for Death\u2019s prediction, and for the outcome (live/die). A properly interventionist reading of CDT requires us to cut incoming arrows into the Act node when we evaluate P(Outcome | do(Act)). That is what makes the probability \u2018causal\u2019 rather than \u2018evidential\u2019. But in Death in Damascus, if we formalise the predictor\u2019s epistemic access as an arrow from Deliberation to Prediction, and if we treat Deliberation as including p, then cutting incoming arrows into Act is not enough. Prediction still depends (via Deliberation) on p, which in turn depends on the act\u2019s own causal expected utility. The probability calculus becomes reflexive. Stated differently, CDT\u2019s way of removing the backflow of information from the act to earlier states breaks down in the presence of ultra-accurate predictors precisely because our own deliberative instability gives the predictor something to go on. That reveals a structural limitation in CDT\u2019s formal recipe.\n\n6. Three possible morals  \n\n6.1 Strengthen CDT\u2019s formal machinery  \nOne could sharpen the interventionist semantics: when evaluating P(Outcome | do(Act)) we do not merely cut arrows into Act; we also sever any arrows from subjective probabilities (or the internal intellectual state) that are themselves functions of Act. In effect we hold fixed not only the physical details of the past but also the agent\u2019s information state. That manoeuvre regains stability at the cost of stipulating that a certain psychological variable is exogenous. Some will object that the stipulation is ad hoc and violates transparency: perfectly informed agents really do expect their decisions to correlate with predictors.\n\n6.2 Accept ratifiability and live with randomisation  \nAnother reaction is to bite the bullet: yes, CDT\u2019s prescriptions depend on p, but the correct CDT agent searches for a fixed point (ratifiable plan) and adopts it. The dependence is then harmless because it is neutralised at equilibrium. On this view the only genuine mistake is to imagine you can evaluate acts at probabilities other than their equilibrium value. The cost is that CDT now requires existence and uniqueness of fixed points; yet in some games no mixed strategy is ratifiable, leaving CDT silent.\n\n6.3 Abandon CDT for a different decision rule  \nThe oscillation phenomenon is taken by some to motivate alternatives such as Functional Decision Theory (FDT) or Updateless Decision Theory, which evaluate acts by holding fixed the algorithm that produces the act rather than the bare physical motion. By evaluating at the level of policy (or of the program you run) the dependence on transient act-probabilities disappears. The same algorithm that outputs \u2018Damascus\u2019 yields survival, hence the theory straightforwardly recommends Damascus and beats CDT\u2019s \u2212500. If one is convinced that the Death problems generalise, then this is a reason to reject CDT altogether.\n\n7. Assessment  \n\nIs the dependence of CDT\u2019s recommendations on current act-probabilities, in Death in Damascus-style cases, a genuine problem? I think it is, because it shows that CDT delivers unstable or under-determined guidance precisely in situations where the correlation between one\u2019s act and upstream predictors is both foreseeable and decision-relevant.  \n\nThe practical oscillation is not the deepest difficulty\u2014after all, we could stipulate that agents adopt the first-pass calculation or randomise in proportion to their credences. The underlying flaw is conceptual: CDT\u2019s way of separating causes from evidential correlations fails when the correlation flows through the agent\u2019s own predictive capacities. Stated more generally, CDT treats the agent as an isolated causal node, but in Predictor scenarios the agent is transparently a piece of a larger algorithm that the Predictor samples. The agent\u2019s subjective probability of acting one way rather than another is not a mere modelling artefact; it is an objective regularity in the world, one that the Predictor exploits. Hence the causal probability distribution is endogenously linked to that subjective probability, and CDT\u2019s equations become self-referential. Any rule whose key quantity is well-defined only after we have solved a fixed-point problem not guaranteed to have a solution looks theoretically fragile.\n\nCould a refined CDT repair the defect? Possibly. But the repair would have to block the self-reference without simply stipulating ignorance or forbidding reflection. That seems difficult without moving in the direction of policy-level or algorithm-level evaluation\u2014in short, without ceasing to be CDT as ordinarily understood.\n\n8. Conclusion  \n\nThe Death in Damascus example reveals that CDT\u2019s causal expected utilities can depend on an agent\u2019s shifting act-probabilities. That dependence is not merely an oddity; it forces CDT into either practical instability or a retreat to mixed strategies that leave it dominated by rival theories in the same circumstances. The root of the trouble is that CDT\u2019s interventionist conditionals cannot cleanly separate an act from the epistemic state that gives rise to the act when powerful predictors are in play. Unless CDT finds a principled way to excise that reflexivity, its claim to be the correct theory of rational choice remains in doubt.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 11, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 3778, "reasoning_tokens": 448}
{"question_id": "GALLOW-CAUSALDECISIONTHEORISTS-2020", "question": "Causal Decision Theory (CDT) evaluates acts by their expected utility, calculated using unconditional probabilities for states not causally downstream of your act. In 'Death in Damascus'-style cases, where you must choose between going to Aleppo or Damascus knowing that Death awaits in whichever city he predicted you would visit (with predictions being reliable but imperfect, and Death having a tendency to guess Damascus), the utility of each act depends on your current probability that you will perform that act. This means CDT's recommendations can shift as your act probabilities change during deliberation. Is this dependence on act probabilities a problem for CDT, and if so, why?", "answer": "1. Introduction\n\nCausal Decision Theory (CDT) is usually praised for two related virtues.  First, it directs the agent to ask the question that seems most relevant to rational choice: \u201cIf I were to perform act A, what causal consequences would probably follow, and how valuable would they be?\u201d  Secondly, it appears to escape the kinds of self\u2013 defeating feedback that beset purely evidential rules; by conditioning only on the counter-factual supposition that the act is performed, CDT is supposed to insulate deliberation from merely evidential correlations between one\u2019s choice and matters outside one\u2019s causal reach.\n\nThe \u201cDeath in Damascus\u2019\u2019 problem (often called \u201cthe prophet puzzle\u2019\u2019 in the contemporary literature) threatens both virtues at once.  Because Death\u2019s location is highly, but not perfectly, correlated with\u200b which city the agent will eventually visit, the unconditional probability of each possibility (Death-in-Damascus versus Death-in-Aleppo) is a function of the agent\u2019s own current probability of performing the act.  As the agent\u2019s probability of going to Damascus slides up or down during deliberation, the very numbers CDT uses to calculate expected utilities slide with it.  That means the act that looks best by CDT\u2019s lights can oscillate back and forth.  In the limit, an ideally reflective CDT-agent looks in danger of paralysis, or of landing on an arbitrary act for no deeper reason than that she happened to start her deliberation with one prior credence rather than another.\n\nIs that dependence on act-probabilities a flaw in CDT?  I shall argue that it is, for two reasons.  First, the oscillation phenomenon shows that CDT, as ordinarily formulated, fails to deliver stable and unambiguous guidance to a deliberating agent in a perfectly ordinary class of decision problems\u2014those in which the world is highly correlated with, but not causally downstream from, the agent\u2019s act.  Second, the root of the instability reveals something deeper: CDT draws its probabilities from the agent\u2019s total prior credence function, yet that credence function contains endogenous variables\u2014the probabilities of the very acts being chosen\u2014that are determined only at the end of deliberation.  Unless CDT is supplemented with an extra rule for fixing those probabilities, it is normatively incomplete.\n\n2. The structure of the case\n\nLet the pay-offs be simple: survival is worth 1, death is worth 0.  Death listens to an imperfect but better-than-chance predictor.  The predictor\u2019s accuracy is 60 %, and\u2014crucially\u2014it has a built-in inclination to guess \u201cDamascus\u2019\u2019 when in doubt.  Formally:\n\nP(Death waits in Damascus | agent goes to Damascus)   = 0.6  \nP(Death waits in Aleppo   | agent goes to Aleppo)     = 0.6  \nP(Death waits in Damascus | agent goes to Aleppo)      = 0.4  \nP(Death waits in Aleppo   | agent goes to Damascus)    = 0.4\n\nFurthermore, when the predictor is uncertain about which city the agent will pick it is slightly more likely to forecast Damascus.  We can model that by letting the unconditional probability that Death chooses Damascus be a convex combination of the two conditional probabilities just stated:\n\nP(Damascus) = 0.6\u00b7P(agent goes to Damascus) + 0.4\u00b7P(agent goes to Aleppo)\n\nDenote the agent\u2019s current subjective probability of going to Damascus by x.  (So P(go Dam.) = x; P(go Aleppo) = 1 \u2013 x.)  Then\n\nP(Death in Damascus)  = 0.6x + 0.4(1 \u2013 x) = 0.4 + 0.2x  \nP(Death in Aleppo)    = 1 \u2013 (0.4 + 0.2x)    = 0.6 \u2013 0.2x\n\nBecause Death\u2019s position is outside the agent\u2019s future light-cone, CDT instructs us to use the unconditional probabilities just displayed when we compute the causal expected utility of each act.  Given the binary utility scale, the causal expected utility of going to Damascus is simply the probability of survival conditional on going to Damascus, i.e. the chance Death is in Aleppo:\n\nEUc(Damascus)   =   P(Death in Aleppo)   = 0.6 \u2013 0.2x\n\nEUc(Aleppo)     =   P(Death in Damascus) = 0.4 + 0.2x\n\nNotice the symmetry: if EUc(Damascus) is larger at some value of x, EUc(Aleppo) will be larger at the complementary value 1 \u2013 x.  Solve for the indifference point:\n\nEUc(Damascus) > EUc(Aleppo)   \n\u2003\u2003\u27fa\u20030.6 \u2013 0.2x  > 0.4 + 0.2x  \n\u2003\u2003\u27fa\u20030.2  > 0.4x  \n\u2003\u2003\u27fa\u2003x  < 0.5\n\nThus:\n\n\u2022 If the agent currently assigns less than 0.5 credence to her going to Damascus, CDT tells her to go to Damascus.  \n\u2022 If the credence is greater than 0.5, CDT tells her to go to Aleppo.  \n\u2022 If the credence is exactly 0.5, CDT is indifferent.\n\nBut the moment the agent follows CDT\u2019s advice and firmly resolves on an act, her self-credence in that act jumps to (approximately) 1.  Hence, if she began with x < 0.5 CDT recommended Damascus; the moment she forms the intention to go to Damascus, x surges to 1, flipping the inequality and making Aleppo the new recommendation.  If she now endorses that new recommendation her credence pivots back to 0, and so on.  CDT\u2019s deliberative guidance is therefore dynamically unstable.\n\n3. Three immediate reactions\n\na. \u201cReal agents merely pick an act and stop.\u201d  One might insist that rational agents, once they discover an act that maximises expected causal utility given their current probabilities, should immediately adopt that act with certainty, and that they should not reopen deliberation afterward.  But if the agent is ideally rational she also knows that in doing so she will change her own act-probabilities, and hence she can foresee that the very adoption of a firm intention will undermine the reason for adopting it.  An ideal CDT-agent, being fully reflective, cannot ignore that fact.\n\nb. \u201cThe oscillation is a pathology of self-prediction, not of CDT.\u201d  Yet nothing exotic is required to generate the instability\u2014only an ordinary correlation between what the agent will do and some outcome beyond her causal control.  Predictors, forecasters, market traders and strategic opponents supply such correlations in realistic situations.  If CDT lacks stable advice in all those cases, that is CDT\u2019s problem.\n\nc. \u201cPerhaps the right solution is to treat acts as evidentially impossible.\u201d  Some proponents of CDT (notably Skyrms and Joyce in different ways) have suggested that a rational agent should assign probability 0 or 1 to whichever act she will in fact perform; any non-extreme credence in one\u2019s own future act reflects an occult form of self-doubt ruled irrational by the very norms of deliberation.  If so, x must be either 0 or 1 throughout deliberation, making one of the two expected-utility functions undefined, and the instability evaporates.  But the move is dialectically costly.  CDT was sold as a theory that merely instructs us how to turn given credences into choices; now it is telling us, on pain of irrationality, what those credences must be.  Moreover, it is implausible that perfectly rational creatures can never be genuinely uncertain which of two evenly matched options they will pick\u2014as though Buridan\u2019s ass must be irrational simply for not yet knowing which bale of hay it will wander toward.\n\n4. Why the dependence is a genuine problem\n\n4.1  Dynamic inconsistency\n\nThe hallmark of a sound decision theory is that it issues advice that an agent can follow through reflective equilibrium\u2014that is, advice whose rationale survives the agent\u2019s own awareness that she is about to follow it.  CDT\u2019s advice in the Damascus case, however, is self-undermining.  Whatever choice-probability x obtains at an early stage of deliberation, CDT recommends an act that will move x to a new value that reverses the recommendation.  That is a species of dynamic inconsistency.  Dynamic inconsistency is familiar in time-inconsistent preference orderings (hyper-bolic discounting, preference reversals, etc.), but here the inconsistency arises not from changing utilities but from the way CDT embeds changing probabilities into its own decision rule.  And it is endemic, not exceptional: any predictable correlation between acts and outcomes that lie outside their causal influence will have the same structure.\n\n4.2  Normative incompleteness\n\nCDT tells us: \u201cFor each act A, compute EUc(A) = \u03a3s P(s)\u00b7U(A, s), where the sum runs over causal-parents-of-A.\u2019\u2019  But in a case like Damascus the unconditional state probabilities P(s) are themselves functions of the probabilities of the very acts whose utilities we are trying to evaluate.  CDT therefore maps the agent\u2019s credence vector into itself.  Nothing in standard CDT stipulates where in that moving landscape the agent\u2019s credences should settle.  A theory that produces mutually inconsistent recommendations for different admissible starting points lacks a fixed-point and so is normatively incomplete.  Until CDT is supplemented with additional principles\u2014ratifiability, reflection stability, policy selection, what have you\u2014it does not yield a single, determinate answer to the decision problem.\n\n4.3  Illusion of control revisited\n\nSome defenders hold that the agent should set x = 1 for whichever act maximises causal expected utility, where maximisation is now done holding x fixed at 1.  In effect CDT becomes:\n\nChoose the act that would best achieve your objectives on the supposition that you determinately choose it.\n\nBut that is tantamount to ignoring the evidential information your act carries about outside matters, even when you know that your act has no causal leverage over them.  The oscillation in the Damascus story occurs precisely because CDT strives both to respect and to ignore the correlation: it uses the unconditional (hence correlation-laden) probabilities P(s), yet it pretends that choosing but not performing an act does nothing to those probabilities.  That is an illusion of control in the opposite direction: the agent treats the probabilities as though she could freeze them by a fiat of deliberative will.  In the real world she cannot; conditional on her eventually acting one way, the environment is already configured in a matching way.  CDT\u2019s prescription therefore suffers from an evidential blind spot: by focusing exclusively on causal influence, it ends up treating predictable evidential correlations as if they could be wished away.\n\n4.4  Loss of money pumps and Dutch books\n\nInstabilities in a decision rule often manifest as Dutch-book vulnerability.  Imagine a wily bookmaker who can observe or reliably infer the agent\u2019s current act-credence x.  While x < 0.5 she can sell the agent at a fair price an insurance contract that pays one util if Death is in Aleppo; the agent, thinking she is headed for Damascus, values that contract at exactly EUc(Damascus) = 0.6 \u2013 0.2x and buys it.  Now persuading the agent to form the intention to go to Damascus bumps x to 1 and reverses the valuation; the agent wants to undo the purchase, selling the contract back at EUc(Aleppo) = 0.4 + 0.2x = 0.6.  The bookmaker pockets 0.2 utils.  The cycle can be repeated arbitrarily often.  The point is not merely that CDT permits money pumps (indifference theories do too), but that the dependence on act-probabilities furnishes the exploiter with a lever to pump money in real time, revealing a structural weakness of the decision rule itself.\n\n5. Proposed repairs and why they fall short\n\n5.1  Ratifiability\n\nJeffrey\u2019s ratifiability principle says that a rational act must be such that, were one to learn that one will perform it, one would still endorse it.  In Damascus the only ratifiable mixtures are x = 0.5 (where the agent is indifferent) and perhaps x = 1/2 under infinitesimal trembles.  That solves the oscillation, but at the cost of recommending indecision\u2014going neither to Damascus nor to Aleppo with certainty, but dithering in a half-hearted mix.  Few take that to be a satisfactory verdict.\n\n5.2  Policy-choice CDT\n\nAnother tack is to shift the unit of evaluation from single acts to whole decision policies.  A policy, roughly, is a function from possible information states to acts.  The agent therefore adopts ex ante a policy that maximises expected causal utility and then executes the policy without further deliberation.  Because the act-probabilities are fixed by the policy, not by online deliberation, oscillation is avoided.  Policy-choice CDT thereby reproduces one of the main insights of Functional Decision Theory and Updateless Decision Theory.  Yet that is to concede that standard, act-by-act CDT is inadequate; the dependence on act-probabilities is precisely what forces the policymaker upgrade.\n\n5.3  Evidential decision theory\n\nEDT, of course, cares only about P(s | A) rather than P(s).  In the Death in Damascus set-up, conditioning on A makes Death\u2019s location strongly (though not perfectly) correlated with A.  EDT therefore recommends *going where you least expect to go*, the exact opposite of CDT\u2019s first recommendation.  EDT thus sidesteps oscillation by leaning hard into the correlation.  However, EDT has its own well-known problems (Smoking Lesion cases, etc.) and so shifting from CDT to EDT just swaps pathologies rather than curing them.\n\n6. The deeper conceptual lesson\n\nWhy is the dependence of CDT\u2019s expected utilities on act-probabilities so corrosive?  The root difficulty is that CDT generically assumes that the agent walks into the decision problem with a fully formed probability distribution over states of the world, including agencies\u2019 own acts.  But those acts are not part of the exogenous state of nature; they are endogenously chosen in light of the very decision rule whose inputs the distribution is supposed to supply.  When the world is correlated with the act, the boundary between what is given and what is generated collapses.  CDT tries to use the same distribution for two incompatible roles: evidential guide and causal yardstick.  In Damascus the clash becomes visible, but the structural mismatch is present wherever the world \u201cknows\u2019\u2019 something about what the agent will do.\n\nThe correct moral, I submit, is that a decision rule must be reflexive: it must model not only how the world causally reacts to the act, but also how the world probabilistically co-moves with the agent\u2019s decision-making process itself.  CDT, in its standard act-centred form, refuses to countenance those reflexive links, so it is forced into an awkward dance with its own changing act-probabilities.  The resulting instability is the symptom.\n\n7. Conclusion\n\nStandard, act-by-act Causal Decision Theory instructs us to evaluate each available act using unconditional state probabilities.  In Death-in-Damascus-style cases those probabilities co-vary with the agent\u2019s own changing credence about which act she will perform.  The upshot is substantive instability: CDT\u2019s recommendation flips each time the agent updates her self-prediction, yielding dynamic inconsistency, Dutch-book vulnerability, and ultimately normative incompleteness.  Remedies such as ratifiability or policy-level choice either yield unsatisfactory indecision or amount to abandoning the act-centred version of CDT altogether.  Hence the dependence of CDT\u2019s recommendations on the agent\u2019s current act-probabilities is indeed a serious problem\u2014serious enough to motivate a re-examination of the foundations of causal decision-making itself.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 12, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 4490, "reasoning_tokens": 1024}
{"question_id": "GALLOW-CAUSALDECISIONTHEORISTS-2020", "question": "Causal Decision Theory (CDT) evaluates acts by their expected utility, calculated using unconditional probabilities for states not causally downstream of your act. In 'Death in Damascus'-style cases, where you must choose between going to Aleppo or Damascus knowing that Death awaits in whichever city he predicted you would visit (with predictions being reliable but imperfect, and Death having a tendency to guess Damascus), the utility of each act depends on your current probability that you will perform that act. This means CDT's recommendations can shift as your act probabilities change during deliberation. Is this dependence on act probabilities a problem for CDT, and if so, why?", "answer": "1. Framing the difficulty  \n\nCausal Decision Theory (CDT) begins from a seemingly simple idea: when I am weighing acts, I should ask which act would causally bring about the best expected outcome.  Formally,\n\n      EU(a) = \u03a3s  P(s | do a) \u00b7 U(outcome of a in s),\n\nwhere the sum ranges over \u201cstates of the world\u201d s that are not causally downstream of the act a.  The probabilities P(s | do a) are supposed to be the unconditional, pre-act probabilities of those states; unlike Evidential Decision Theory, CDT refuses to conditionalise on the act itself when computing those numbers.\n\nIn ordinary cases this machinery behaves nicely.  Whether I turn the kettle on has no causal effect on today\u2019s weather, so the probability of rain appears in the same position in the expected-utility formula whichever act I am evaluating.  But in so-called \u201cDeath in Damascus\u201d scenarios things are less tidy.  There is only one causally independent state that really matters, namely\n\n      sD  =  Death is waiting in Damascus\n      sA  =  Death is waiting in Aleppo.\n\nYet my probability for sD and sA is not fixed in the way the probability of rain is.  Because Death is a good predictor, my own credence that I will go to Damascus raises my credence that Death will be in Damascus.  Consequently the probability figures CDT feeds into its expectation formula depend on my current state of deliberation.  If, half a second ago, I was 70 % inclined to head for Damascus, I will enter P(sD)=.7 into the table and get the advice \u201cGo to Aleppo!\u201d.  Having now pivoted toward Aleppo, I will recompute, see that P(sD)=.3, and obtain the advice \u201cGo to Damascus!\u201d.  The recommendations oscillate with my shifting credence.\n\nThe question is whether this dependence is an embarrassment for CDT, and if it is, what exactly goes wrong.  The rest of the essay pursues three lines of argument.\n\n2. First worry: loss of deliberative stability  \n\nA decision theory should guide a deliberator from uncertainty about what to do to a settled intention.  \u201cDeliberative stability\u201d means that once I arrive at the act the theory recommends, I no longer have a motivation (generated by the very same theory) to reopen the question.  CDT in the Death in Damascus set-up fails that test.\n\nTo see the contrast, imagine I am choosing whether to raise an umbrella.  CDT says:\n\n      EU(raise)   =  0.9\u00b7(stay dry)  +  0.1\u00b7(awkward to carry)\n      EU(not)     =  0.1\u00b7(get wet)   +  0.9\u00b7(hands free),\n\nnumbers pulled from the background weather forecast.  Either I judge EU(raise) > EU(not) or vice-versa; once the comparison is done, the inputs do not change merely because my intention has crystallised.\n\nIn Death in Damascus there is no analogous \u201cexogenous\u201d forecast.  The only serious evidence about where Death will be comes from the very pattern of intentions I am currently forming.  A moment\u2019s reflection shows why that undermines stability.  Let p be my current credence that I will pick Damascus.  CDT then writes:\n\n      EU(Damascus)  =  p\u00b7(live) + (1\u2013p)\u00b7(die).\n      EU(Aleppo)    = (1\u2013p)\u00b7(live) +  p\u00b7(die).\n\nAssuming Death is worse than survival, EU(Damascus) < EU(Aleppo) precisely when p > \u00bd, and the inequality flips the other way when p < \u00bd.  But deliberation is the very process of shifting p.  So whichever action currently looks best will immediately push p in the opposite direction, revoking itself.  The algorithm never reaches a fixed point unless p stalls exactly at \u00bd.  CDT thereby fails the \u201cguidance\u201d test: it cannot deliver a stable intention unless the agent succeeds in a delicate act of self-manipulation (adopting precisely a 50 % mixture), an act for which the theory gives no general recipe.\n\nThe defender of CDT might reply that instability is not always fatal.  In economic models it can be rationally required to randomise among equilibria; \u201cmixed strategies\u201d are ubiquitous in game theory.  Couldn\u2019t the CDT-guided agent simply toss a fair coin and so achieve p=\u00bd?  Two rejoinders:\n\na. Mixed strategies that emerge from game-theoretic reasoning are supported by a vertex: once I have publicly committed to the mixture, each pure deviation is disincentivised by the other player\u2019s optimal response.  In Death in Damascus there is no strategic opponent whom I can predictably sway by pre-committing.  Death has already made his prediction.  So declaring \u201cwith probability \u00bd I shall go to Damascus\u201d achieves nothing.\n\nb. CDT, as usually formulated, is a theory about which act to perform, not about which lottery over acts to implement.  Randomising is an additional act.  But whether randomisation helps depends on my credence that I will randomise, thrusting us back into the same regress.\n\nHence the first problem for CDT is that, in these predictor cases, it loses its practical traction.  A theory whose recommendations bounce around faster than I can implement them is of little use as an action-guiding tool.\n\n3. Second worry: unratifiable advice  \n\nRichard Jeffrey (and later, Skyrms, Gibbard and Harper) distinguished between an act\u2019s being recommended and its being ratifiable.  An act is ratifiable when, conditional on learning that I am about to perform it, I would still regard it as the best choice.  In Death in Damascus no pure act is ratifiable under CDT.  Suppose I reach the point where I know I shall go to Damascus.  Then I know p\u22481, and EU(Damascus) is worse than EU(Aleppo).  So the very information that I am choosing Damascus de-ratifies Damascus.  Likewise if I learn I am heading to Aleppo.  Ratifiability failure suggests that following CDT will place me in a position where, on the brink of acting, I believe that a switch would improve expected utility.\n\nSome philosophers, e.g. Jeffrey and Joyce, have urged \u201cratification\u201d as an additional constraint on rational action.  Others deny its necessity but concede that gross failures of ratifiability generate cognitive dissonance: CDT makes me think, all things considered, that whatever I in fact am doing is sub-optimal.  That verdict is, at the very least, epistemically uncomfortable.  The underlying reason is again the dependence of EU on the shifting self-probability p.\n\n4. Third worry: the corruption of unconditional probabilities  \n\nThe heart of CDT is the do-operator: P(s | do a) should be the probability of s when we hold fixed that a is performed by a causal intervention.  The whole point of the intervention metaphor is to break causal links from a to states that precede or are causally independent of a.  But in Death in Damascus it turns out to be devilishly hard to impose the intervention in one\u2019s belief state.  If during deliberation I become confident I will go to Damascus, then, given what I know about the predictor, I automatically become confident that Death predicted Damascus yesterday.  The two propositions may be causally independent, but they are not epistemically independent.  Somehow I must resist updating on my own intention if I am to keep the do-probabilities fixed.  The resulting cognitive exercise\u2014mentally \u201cclamping\u201d the act while simultaneously bracketing all the information that intention provides\u2014looks psychologically impossible.\n\nSo we face a dilemma:\n\n\u2022 Either the agent uses true unconditional probabilities, and those inevitably vary with her current beliefs about her imminent behaviour, blowing up deliberative stability.\n\n\u2022 Or she tries to imagine what her probabilities would be if she deleted the evidential link between her action and Death\u2019s prediction.  But then she is no longer using her real credences, contradicting the personalist spirit of CDT.\n\nA theory that demands psychological tricks its adherents cannot execute is, arguably, normatively defective.\n\n5. Could the problem be dismissed as an artefact?  \n\nPerhaps the dependence on act probabilities is not a deep flaw but a peculiarity of highly artificial predictor stories.  Two counterpoints.\n\nFirst, predictor stories are not rare curiosities: they exemplify any situation in which other agents (human or algorithmic) form beliefs about what I will do and act on the basis of those beliefs.  Stock markets, diplomacy, auction design, and everyday social life teem with such feedback loops.  If CDT stumbles whenever my action is correlatively entwined with earlier predictions, it is in trouble far beyond philosophy seminars.\n\nSecond, the instability arises even without a prescient demon.  Consider a variant: you have a mild psychological bias toward whichever city you think less dangerous.  As you lean toward Damascus you relax, start guessing that Death will be in Aleppo, which in turn reinforces the inclination to Damascus\u2014and vice-versa.  Again, the relevant probabilities are self-referential.  The puzzle is structural, not contingent on supernatural predictors.\n\n6. Replies on behalf of CDT  \n\nSeveral manoeuvres have been proposed to shield CDT.\n\n6.1  Commitment to a policy rather than a momentary act  \n\nWhy not evaluate whole policies\u2014rules mapping information states to acts\u2014instead of single acts?  Let \u03c0 be a policy: \u201cIf my present credence p exceeds \u00bd go to Aleppo, otherwise go to Damascus.\u201d  Plugging \u03c0 into CDT yields a unique expected utility because \u03c0\u2019s specification removes the feedback loop: knowing the rule fixes how acts correlate with Death\u2019s earlier prediction.  Once a policy is in place, one never re-evaluates mid-deliberation.\n\nTwo problems:\n\na. Standard CDT does not quantify over policies; introducing them is a substantive revision, nearer to \u201cUpdateless\u201d or \u201cFunctional\u201d Decision Theory.\n\nb. Even if policies are admitted, which one should I adopt now?  The same instability infects the choice of policy unless a higher-order commitment is already in place.  The proposal pushes the problem up a level.\n\n6.2  Ratifiable CDT (Joyce 2012)  \n\nJim Joyce suggests that rational agents should restrict attention to ratifiable acts: acts that would still be preferred upon learning that they are about to be performed.  In Death in Damascus only the 50/50 mixture is ratifiable.  So the agent should randomise.  Joyce concedes that ordinary CDT, unaugmented by ratification, misfires; ratification is offered as the fix.\n\nThis response tacitly admits dependence on act probabilities is a problem for vanilla CDT, and solves it by modifying CDT rather than defending it intact.\n\n6.3  Dismiss coin-flip oscillations as \u201cDutch books against deliberation,\u201d not against choice  \n\nA final defence holds that the oscillations do not matter as long as the last recommendation issued at the instant of choice is coherent.  Deliberation may be messy, but only the end-state counts.  Unfortunately there may be no principled \u201clast\u201d recommendation: the recommendation changes up to the temporal limit point of action.  And rational choice theories are evaluated partly by how they structure deliberation; telling agents not to worry about the turmoil is thin comfort.\n\n7. Diagnosing the root of the difficulty  \n\nThe dependence on act probabilities is puzzling because CDT was designed precisely to isolate causation from mere correlation.  It succeeds in ordinary evidential problems (smoking and cancer, the barometer and the storm) because the evidential link does not run through the agent\u2019s own uncertainty about what she will do.  Once the agent herself becomes the evidential nexus\u2014once the act\u2019s probability is the signal by which the world predicts her\u2014clamping the do-operator severs the wrong links.  The agent\u2019s credal state is not outside the causal graph; it is part of it.  Suppressing the evidential pathway therefore mutilates the real epistemic situation.  CDT either ignores genuine, decision-relevant information (if it tries to keep P(s | do a) fixed) or else becomes dynamically unstable (if it allows the numbers to float with p).  That is the fundamental tension.\n\n8. How severe is the problem?  \n\nSeverity can be measured along three dimensions.\n\na. Guidance.  For decisions where feedback via prediction matters, CDT offers no practicable advice unless the agent artificially suspends introspection or performs delicate randomisation.  That is a pragmatic failure.\n\nb. Theoretical unity.  To patch the hole, CDTers invoke ratifiability, policy choice, or mixed strategies\u2014none derivable from the core causal principle.  The need for ad-hoc supplements suggests the principle is incomplete.\n\nc. Comparative performance.  Evidential Decision Theory, though beset by other worries (Smoking lesion, etc.), at least issues a stable recommendation in Death in Damascus: it says both cities have equal evidential expected utility, so the agent is free to choose or randomise.  Functional Decision Theory, for its part, endorses Damascus (or Aleppo\u2014symmetry again), claiming that the predictor\u2019s earlier action is subjunctively dependent on the algorithm\u2019s output.  CDT is uniquely paralysed.  That comparative disadvantage is evidence of a flaw.\n\n9. Concluding assessment  \n\nDependence on the agent\u2019s shifting probabilities of her own act is indeed a serious problem for CDT.  It erodes deliberative stability, sabotages ratifiability, and forces the theory either to instruct the agent to ignore relevant evidence or to chase its own tail in an infinite regress.  Patching the leak requires extra norms that alter CDT\u2019s identity.  While not a knock-down refutation\u2014one can always graft fixes onto the causal core\u2014the phenomenon reveals that CDT, in its classical form, cannot fully accommodate scenarios in which acts are reliably predicted.  In a world increasingly stocked with predictors\u2014machine-learning algorithms, market analysts, social psychologists\u2014that limitation diminishes CDT\u2019s claim to be the correct theory of rational choice.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 13, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 3581, "reasoning_tokens": 576}
{"question_id": "GALLOW-CAUSALDECISIONTHEORISTS-2020", "question": "Causal Decision Theory (CDT) evaluates acts by their expected utility, calculated using unconditional probabilities for states not causally downstream of your act. In 'Death in Damascus'-style cases, where you must choose between going to Aleppo or Damascus knowing that Death awaits in whichever city he predicted you would visit (with predictions being reliable but imperfect, and Death having a tendency to guess Damascus), the utility of each act depends on your current probability that you will perform that act. This means CDT's recommendations can shift as your act probabilities change during deliberation. Is this dependence on act probabilities a problem for CDT, and if so, why?", "answer": "1. What CDT is committed to  \n\nCausal Decision Theory tells an agent to compute, for every available act A, the causal expected utility\n\nCEU(A) = \u03a3S P(S) \u00b7 U(Outcome(A,S))\n\nwhere the sum ranges over states S that are not causally downstream of the act.  The probabilities to be used are the agent\u2019s unconditional probabilities for those states \u2013 in other words, probabilities that are not conditioned on which act will in fact be performed.  This policy is supposed to insulate choice from merely evidential correlations.  The agent is to imagine \u201cwiring a switch\u201d into the world, hold fixed every variable that is not causally affected by the switch, and ask: given those fixed background facts, which position of the switch produces the best expected outcome?\n\nFor ordinary cases, the recipe is uncontroversial.  My turning on the light does not affect whether the sun will rise tomorrow, so I should discount that correlation when deciding.  In Newcomb-like and prediction cases, however, the background state is itself correlated with which act I will perform, because the predictor has information about me.  CDT acknowledges this correlation and insists that, when I evaluate a given act, I must use whatever unconditional probability I assign to the predictor\u2019s having forecast that act.  If I currently think there is a 60 % chance that I will choose Damascus, then, given Death\u2019s reliability, I must also think there is about a 60 % chance that Death will be found in Damascus.  Plug that number into the causal expectation of each act and see which comes out higher.\n\nThus CDT\u2019s recommendations depend, quite directly, on the numbers the agent assigns to his own future behaviour.  And those numbers are not parameters fixed from the outside; they change as deliberation proceeds.  The question is whether that dependence is a flaw.\n\n2. The Death in Damascus set-up  \n\nSuppose the pay-offs are simple: survival is worth 0 and death is worth \u20131.  Death is an almost flawless predictor, but he has a default preference for Damascus.  Concretely:\n\nReliability: with probability q = 0.9, he correctly forecasts your eventual destination.  \nBias: when he errs (probability 0.1), he names Damascus.\n\nLet p be your current unconditional credence that you will end up in Damascus.  Then the chances, from your point of view, that Death is waiting in each city are\n\nP(Death in Damascus) = q\u00b7p + (1\u2013q)\u00b71  \nP(Death in Aleppo)   = q\u00b7(1\u2013p)\n\nbecause his mistakes all put him in Damascus.  Expected utilities follow:\n\nCEU(Damascus) = \u2013[q\u00b7p + (1\u2013q)]  \nCEU(Aleppo)   = \u2013[q\u00b7(1\u2013p)]\n\nSubtracting yields\n\n\u0394 = CEU(Aleppo) \u2013 CEU(Damascus) = \u2013q\u00b7(1\u2013p) + q\u00b7p + (1\u2013q)\n   = (2p\u20131)\u00b7q + (1\u2013q).\n\nPlug in q = 0.9: \u0394 = 0.9(2p\u20131) + 0.1.\n\n\u2022 If p < 0.444\u2026, \u0394 > 0, so CDT recommends Aleppo.  \n\u2022 If p > 0.444\u2026, \u0394 < 0, so CDT recommends Damascus.  \n\u2022 If p = 0.444\u2026, the agent is indifferent.\n\nBecause p is the agent\u2019s own belief about what he will do, CDT\u2019s advice flips when that belief crosses a moving threshold.  Start with p = 0.5.  You are told to flee to Damascus (since 0.5 > 0.444).  But as you begin to form the intention to go there, p rises, pushing the Death-in-Damascus probability up, making Damascus incrementally less attractive.  At some stage p might reach 0.7, at which point Aleppo is preferable after all, so you start leaning the other way, and p falls again.  The advice tracks your oscillations.\n\n3. First reason this looks problematic: instability of deliberation  \n\nA basic desideratum for a decision rule is \u201caction-guidance\u201d.  Agents deliberate precisely in order to converge on a choice.  CDT, in these cases, frustrates that aim.  Whenever p is not exactly at the knife-edge value, the rule tells you to do something which, were you to do it, would force you to revise p and hence reverse the recommendation.  One can model the situation as a simple continuous dynamical system: dp/dt is positive when p < 0.444, negative when p > 0.444, and zero at p = 0.444.  The fixed point is unstable; any tiny perturbation pushes p away, culminating in perpetual oscillation or, at best, arbitrarily slow approach to the indifference point.  A deliberative algorithm that systematically fails to stabilise looks, from the inside, like paralysis.  And paralysis is irrational \u2013 not merely psychologically unfortunate but contrary to the purpose of deliberation, which is to settle on a course of action.\n\nThe CDT proponent might reply that a fully rational agent would recognise the instability and leap immediately to the mixed strategy p = 0.444, executing a neurotic coin-flip with those exact odds.  But CDT is officially a theory of acts, not of mixed strategies or policies.  Jeffrey\u2019s \u201cratifiability\u201d amendment attempts to convert it into a policy theory, yet the worry reappears: why should a tiny, stipulative difference in the mixture weight change a matter of life and death?  From the outside, an agent who saves his skin by flipping with probability 0.444 looks lucky, not wise.\n\n4. Second reason: violation of dynamic consistency  \n\nSuppose you initially adopt the mixed strategy p = 0.444.  At the moment the lottery comes out heads and you learn that you will in fact go to Damascus, your credence in choosing Damascus becomes (rationally) 1.  Re-computing CEUs with p = 1, you immediately prefer Aleppo.  So at the plan-forming stage you prefer the policy that entails your later certain self preferring to deviate.  That is a failure of \u201csophisticated-dynamic consistency\u201d, the standard of rationality in sequential decision theory.  Strategies that violate the principle are dominated: there exists some alternative policy that, while maybe giving up some expected value in one node, never leaves expected value on the table once subsequent re-optimisations are accounted for.  CDT\u2019s advice thus exposes agents to a form of dynamic incoherence that orthodox decision theory is designed to avoid.\n\n5. Third reason: dependence on an epistemically irrelevant parameter  \n\nAct credences are not exogenous features of the world; they are artefacts of the agent\u2019s self-knowledge at a particular stage of reflection.  If two agents are in every external respect identical \u2013 same information about the predictor, same utilities \u2013 but happen to assign slightly different subjective probabilities to their own future choice, CDT will give them incompatible recommendations.  Yet rationality, at least in its standard Bayesian form, is supposed to supervene on the agent\u2019s information about the world, not on such purely introspective variance.  This violates what Joyce calls the \u201cRelevance Principle\u201d: only factors that bear on consequences via the pathways recognised by the theory should affect choice.  Whether I introspectively judge my eventual choice-probability to be 0.51 or 0.49 should not alter what counts as the rational act, any more than your degree of confidence that you will toss the coin heads should alter whether you ought to prefer heads or tails.  CDT makes the mistake of inflating epiphenomenal uncertainty into a decision-relevant variable.\n\n6. Fourth reason: susceptibility to a money pump  \n\nSkyrms noted that an exploiter who can charge you tiny transaction costs for changing tickets back and forth between Damascus and Aleppo can extract unbounded expected revenue while you dither.  The CDT agent is money-pumpable.  Classical utility theory treats immunity to sure-loss exploitation as a necessary condition of rationality.  (The underlying mathematics is that CDT\u2019s preference ordering is not cyclic but it is path-dependent: the act favoured at time t+1 depends on the act credence at t, which depends on the act previously favoured, etc.)  The money-pump argument therefore translates the abstract deliberative instability into a concrete allegation of irrationality.\n\n7. Are these merely pragmatic defects?  \n\nOne might argue that a decision theory\u2019s job is only to say which act has the highest causal expected utility at the moment of choice.  If that verdict happens to change as the agent\u2019s self-knowledge changes, so be it; rational deliberators should instantly update their plans with every introspective flicker.  Pragmatic objections \u2013 dithering, money-pumps, dynamic inconsistency \u2013 could be dismissed as artefacts of imperfectly efficient cognition.  Real-time oscillation would never arise for an ideal agent capable of instant leap to the fixed point.\n\nBut the underlying problem is not computational; it is conceptual.  CDT\u2019s core prescription requires the agent to treat her own act as probabilistically independent of everything it does not causally affect.  In Death in Damascus the predictor\u2019s location is not causally downstream of the act, but it is predictively downstream of the agent\u2019s deliberative state.  The agent therefore has to partition the world in a way that carves out her own internal probabilities as one of the \u201cstates\u201d that get held fixed.  Once that carving is done, the unconditional probability of Death\u2019s location literally is a function of P(A).  So there is no invariant quantity for the theory to latch on to.  The dependence is built into the ontology.\n\nIf, by contrast, one adopted Evidential Decision Theory, one would simply condition on the contemplated act: EDT tells you to go to the city such that P(Death | you go there) is smallest.  Since conditional probabilities are not functions of P(A), EDT gives stable advice: go to Aleppo, because discovering that you are in Aleppo would be good news about survival.  Whether that is ultimately the right prescription is controversial, but at least it is action-guiding.  Functional Decision Theory (FDT) gives the same stable advice for a different reason: it treats the predictor\u2019s output as counterfactually dependent on the algorithm\u2019s decision, hence sees a policy of \u201calways Aleppo\u201d as causally buying better survival odds.\n\nThus CDT\u2019s act-probability dependence is not an innocuous quirk; it is the symptom of a deeper structural misfit between its causal-screening ideal and situations involving accurate prediction.\n\n8. Possible repairs and why they fail  \n\n\u2022 Ratifiability: Jeffrey suggested that a rational act must be one that remains optimal upon learning that one is about to do it.  In Death in Damascus neither city is ratifiable, so the ratifiability criterion declares every option irrational.  A theory that routinely issues the verdict \u201cdo nothing\u201d is not helpful.\n\n\u2022 Mixed acts as primitives: Suppose we let \u201cchoose Damascus with probability r\u201d be an act in its own right.  Then CDT does deliver a determinate answer: pick r = 0.444 (the unique fixed point of the CEU equations).  Yet at the moment the randomiser yields an actual city, the instability re-emerges, unless we forbid re-decision.  What forbids it cannot be CDT itself \u2013 CDT just told you, after the coin comes up heads, that Aleppo is now better.  So the fix imports an extra-theoretical norm that trumps CDT\u2019s own prescriptions.\n\n\u2022 Causal graphs enriched with logical nodes: Another manoeuvre is to say that the predictor\u2019s belief is causally downstream of the algorithm you instantiate, so CDT should have conditioned on that node.  But that is exactly the move that characterises FDT, not orthodox CDT.  Once these logical dependencies are added, the theory ceases to be CDT.\n\n\u2022 Hard-commitment devices: You could sign a contract scrawled in blood to take whichever city you first pick.  That stabilises p at 1 or 0.  Yet CDT already told you that if you are committed to Damascus, you regret it, so ex ante CDT prefers not to enter the commitment.  Appealing to pre-decision binding therefore amounts to changing the decision problem.\n\n9. Sober conclusion  \n\nCDT\u2019s dependence on act probabilities is a problem for at least four independent reasons:\n\n(1) It deprives the theory of determinate, stable guidance for agents who deliberate about what to do.\n\n(2) It yields dynamically inconsistent strategies: a sophisticated CDT agent knowingly adopts a plan she will later wish to abandon.\n\n(3) It makes rational choice hinge on purely introspective probability assignments that lack external relevance, violating standard supervenience requirements on rational preference.\n\n(4) It exposes agents to guaranteed exploitable losses, contradicting one of the oldest norms of rational decision-making.\n\nThese defects are not mere implementation glitches; they follow from the very heart of CDT\u2019s causal-screening rule when applied to prediction problems.  The only available repairs either strip CDT of its defining principle (by treating the predictor as causally downstream of the choice) or enact ad hoc behavioural constraints that override the theory\u2019s own moment-to-moment verdicts.\n\nTherefore the dependence on act probabilities is indeed a serious problem for Causal Decision Theory.  It shows that CDT, at least in its canonical form, cannot be a complete account of rational choice in a world where other agents \u2013 or the environment itself \u2013 can predict what we will do.  To regain action-guidance, dynamic coherence, and immunity to exploitation, one must move to a different framework, such as Evidential or Functional Decision Theory, or else invent a new hybrid that severs the link between an agent\u2019s provisional self-probabilities and the unconditional probabilities CDT instructs her to use.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 14, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 4004, "reasoning_tokens": 1024}
{"question_id": "ISSEROW-MORALWORTH-2020", "question": "Many philosophers have argued that the motive of duty\u2014understood as a de dicto desire to do what is morally right\u2014cannot suffice for moral worth. On their view, praiseworthy agents must be motivated by the concrete considerations that explain why their actions are right (such as concern for others' welfare), rather than by an abstract concern for morality as such. Critics charge that agents motivated solely by duty exhibit a kind of moral fetishism or alienation from what morality is really about. Can acting solely from a desire to do what is morally right suffice as a motive for morally worthy conduct? If so, what makes such dutiful action praiseworthy?", "answer": "1. Introduction  \n\nSuppose I return a stranger\u2019s wallet solely because I want to do what morality requires.  I do not feel special concern for the stranger, nor am I moved by hopes of reward or fear of reproach; I act simply because my considered judgment is that returning the wallet is the right thing to do.  Many philosophers\u2014from Friedrich Schiller\u2019s quip that one should act \u201cout of inclination\u201d rather than \u201ccold duty,\u201d through Michael Stocker\u2019s \u201cmoral schizophrenia,\u201d to contemporary worries about \u201cmoral fetishism\u201d\u2014regard this form of motivation as at best second-best and at worst morally impoverished.  They allow that the act is right, yet doubt that it has the distinctive moral worth that grounds praise.  After all (the worry goes), morality is ultimately about humans\u2019 concrete interests and needs; an agent moved only by an abstract de dicto desire \u201cto do the right thing\u201d seems alienated from what makes the action right and thus from the people to whom morality is supposed to matter.\n\nKantians, however, have long insisted that acting from duty can be not merely sufficient but paradigmatic of morally worthy conduct.  On Kant\u2019s picture, it is precisely respect for the moral law\u2014rather than sympathy, love, or any other contingent feeling\u2014that confers moral worth on an action.  Yet Kant\u2019s official view is often read as allowing moral motivation to be de re as well as de dicto: when I recognize that helping you is required by the moral law, my motive is simultaneously respect for the law and concern for your rational agency.  The debate, therefore, is not as simple as \u201cKantians say yes, sentimentalists say no.\u201d  The crux is whether the bare motive \u201cbecause it is the morally right thing\u201d can, by itself and without further content, ground praiseworthiness.\n\nI shall defend an affirmative but qualified answer.  A purely de dicto desire to do what is morally right can suffice for moral worth, provided that (a) it is sensitive to the right-making considerations; (b) it manifests a reliable capacity to respond to moral reasons; and (c) it expresses a quality of will that respects the moral standing of others.  Properly understood, acting from duty need not display fetishism or alienation.  Rather, it can reveal the distinctive form of regard that persons owe one another: practical recognition of the authority of moral requirements.  I will argue for this conclusion in four steps: (1) clarifying the distinction between de dicto and de re moral desires; (2) explaining the \u201cmoral fetishism\u201d objection; (3) showing why a suitably specified de dicto motive escapes that objection; and (4) articulating what makes such dutiful action worthy of praise.\n\n2. De dicto vs. De re Moral Motivation  \n\nA de re desire is directed at a particular object or property.  If I help you because I want your welfare, my desire\u2019s content already includes you or your welfare; it is immediately about what makes the action right.  By contrast, a de dicto desire is for whatever satisfies a certain description.  When I act from a de dicto desire to do what is morally right, the motivational content is exhausted by the description \u201cright action,\u201d leaving open which concrete considerations\u2014welfare, autonomy, fairness\u2014make the action instantiate that description.\n\nThe distinction is orthogonal to the familiar contrast between instrumental and final desires.  A de dicto desire could be intrinsic: I value doing the right thing for its own sake, not merely as a means.  Conversely, a de re desire could be instrumental: I might promote your welfare only to curry favor.  The question is not about the order of value but about what guides the agent\u2019s motivational attention.\n\nConsider two rescuers who pull a drowning child from a river.  The first is moved by immediate concern for the child\u2019s suffering (de re).  The second is moved only by the judgment, \u201cSaving her is the right thing to do\u201d (de dicto).  Both perceive the same right-making facts, but they are differently attuned.  Are both equally praiseworthy?  Intuition often tilts toward the first rescuer: his concern seems substantively appropriate, whereas the second appears cool or self-absorbed.  Yet intuition is not argument, and the second rescuer\u2019s motivation may possess a form of moral excellence that the first lacks\u2014e.g., steadiness across cases or expression of equal respect to any potential victim.  To see whether that suffices for moral worth, we must scrutinize the fetishism charge.\n\n3. The Moral Fetishism Objection  \n\nMichael Smith coined \u201cmoral fetishism\u201d to capture the idea that a de dicto motive treats the property of being morally required as an object of desire in the wrong way.  The fetishist, like a sexual fetishist fixated on footwear rather than persons, supposedly cares about the moral status of her deeds rather than about the underlying values that make them morally significant.  She displays, in Bernard Williams\u2019s phrase, a form of motivational \u201calienation\u201d from her own projects and from the world.  Stocker dramatizes the worry with the hospital visitor who tells the bedridden patient, \u201cI\u2019m here only because it is morally obligatory.\u201d  The visit\u2019s very point\u2014expressing personal concern\u2014seems undermined when that is the visitor\u2019s sole motive.\n\nThe charge rests on two assumptions.\n\na. Descriptivism about Worth: An action\u2019s moral worth depends on the agent\u2019s being moved by the same considerations that morally justify the action.\n\nb. Skepticism about Abstraction: A purely procedural or formal respect for rightness is motivationally too abstract to connect the agent to those justifying considerations.\n\nPut crudely: genuine concern for people looks to people; abstract concern for morality looks past them.\n\nBut these assumptions can be resisted.\n\n4. A Kantian-Inspired Reply  \n\nKant famously distinguishes acting \u201cin conformity with duty\u201d from acting \u201cfrom duty.\u201d  The former is behavior that accords with moral law whatever its motive; the latter is behavior undertaken from respect for the moral law.  Only the latter possesses moral worth.  Kant\u2019s own examples (the grocer who gives fair change to preserve reputation, the philanthropist who helps from sympathy) suggest that motives grounded in inclination alone, even admirable inclinations, fall short of full moral worth.\n\nCritics retort that Kant valorizes cold duty.  Yet Kant intends his notion of respect to be the form through which we recognize the dignity of humanity, both in ourselves and others.  When I help you from duty, I am not indifferent to your welfare; rather, I appreciate your status as an end-in-yourself through the medium of law-governed practical reason.  Duty is not a mask that occludes concrete values; it is the rational standpoint from which those values can claim unconditioned authority.  So Kant already finds in the de dicto desire to \u201cdo what is right\u201d the appropriate recognition of the right-making facts: they enter the deliberative story as the content of practical law.\n\nThe contemporary Kantian can refine this.  The dutiful agent\u2019s deliberative route proceeds roughly as follows:\n\n1. She discerns that the child\u2019s peril gives her a moral reason to act.\n2. She universalizes the maxim of ignoring such peril and finds it impermissible.\n3. Respecting the moral law, she commits to rescue.\n\nHer explicit motive is \u201cbecause it is required,\u201d but the warrant for that requirement is that a rational will could not will otherwise, given the child\u2019s welfare.  The de dicto content \u201crequired\u201d is therefore transparently linked to the de re fact of the child\u2019s need; the agent is actively responsive to that fact, although it does not figure as her direct desire.  Hence the fetishism charge misconstrues what a properly functioning de dicto motive is.  It is not a rigid fixation on the label \u201cright\u201d; it is a second-order responsiveness to whatever reasons make something right.\n\n5. A Non-Kantian Reconstruction: Reasons-Responsiveness  \n\nNot everyone will buy Kant\u2019s transcendental apparatus.  Fortunately, a more ecumenical defense is available.  On recent \u201cquality-of-will\u201d accounts of moral worth (T. M. Scanlon, Stephen Darwall, Angela Smith), what merits praise is the agent\u2019s responsiveness to the moral demands that other persons are entitled to make.  Such responsiveness need not take the form of warm feeling; it can be realized by recognition of normative reasons as such.  The crucial features are:\n\na. Epistemic sensitivity: the agent is disposed to grasp which considerations generate moral reasons.\n\nb. Practical governance: those considerations reliably move her to act.\n\nc. Non-egoistic orientation: the agent\u2019s motivational set makes appropriate reference to others\u2019 claims, not merely to self-regarding benefits.\n\nA minimally contentful de dicto desire\u2014\u201cto do what I have most reason, morally speaking, to do\u201d\u2014can fulfill all three conditions, provided that the agent\u2019s normative competence is in order.  Precisely because the desire is second-order, it can flexibly accommodate any right-making feature across contexts.  Concern for welfare, fairness, autonomy, fidelity, and so on, all matter in virtue of falling under the variable of \u201cwhat morality requires here.\u201d  Far from being blind to content, the de dicto agent must actively survey and integrate the content to determine what is required.  The alienation worry arises only if we picture her as consulting a mystical moral barometer rather than engaging in the deliberative work of identifying concrete reasons.\n\nAn analogy: A good judge aims above all to \u201cdo justice according to law.\u201d  That is a formal description of her motive.  But to act on it the judge must sensitively interpret statutes, precedents, and facts.  We do not say she suffers legal fetishism; rather, we admire her fidelity to the law as the integrative principle under which all the substantive considerations attain their normative shape.  Likewise, the dutiful moral agent\u2019s animating desire to \u201cdo the right thing\u201d is praiseworthy insofar as she mobilizes it through an accurate grasp of what the right thing is.\n\n6. Why Praiseworthy?  Three Interlocking Grounds  \n\nIf the above diagnosis is correct, what exactly makes dutiful action worthy of praise?  I propose three mutually reinforcing grounds.\n\n(1) Reliability and Generality  \n\nA de re motive such as sympathy is often partial and fickle.  It tracks salient features (visible suffering, similarity to self, affective proximity), leaving the agent insensitive to morally relevant but less vivid cases.  The de dicto motive, by contrast, is potentially universal in scope.  Because it is keyed to the property of \u201cbeing right,\u201d it can motivate the agent in any circumstance where that property is instantiated.  This dispositional reliability expresses a stable moral character\u2014precisely the trait we often intend to praise.\n\n(2) Respect and Second-Personal Recognition  \n\nDarwall argues that \u201crecognition respect\u201d\u2014acknowledging another\u2019s authority to make claims on us\u2014is central to morality.  Acting from duty embodies such respect.  The agent\u2019s practical stance is, \u201cI stand under an obligation that anyone in your position could rightly demand from me.\u201d  Praise is appropriate because the action carries an interpersonal meaning: it publicly acknowledges the other as a moral equal.  Sympathy, by contrast, need not convey this acknowledgement; one may feel pity without respecting agency.\n\n(3) Practical Rationality Itself as a Moral Good  \n\nKant spoke of the \u201csupreme condition\u201d of all ends: acting from the idea of law.  Contemporary theorists such as Christine Korsgaard and Joseph Raz similarly hold that treating reasons as reasons\u2014letting them guide and govern\u2014is a form of self-constitution that has intrinsic moral value.  When I succeed in doing what I judge right because I judge it right, I realize the capacity to be guided by reason.  That achievement is not merely instrumentally but constitutively good; it manifests autonomy.  Praiseworthiness, therefore, attaches not only to the benefit conferred on others but to the quality of agency displayed.\n\n7. Replies to Objections  \n\nObjection 1: The hospital visitor case still feels wrong.  If you tell me you are here only from duty, you insult me.\n\nReply: The wrongness lies not in the motivational reality but in its inappropriate avowal.  Expressive considerations differ from worth: one can display bad manners or hurt feelings by revealing a respectable motive.  Moreover, the visitor who harps on duty may thereby manifest a disrespectful attitude (\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be here if I weren\u2019t forced\u201d), which shows a lack of wholehearted identification with duty.  That is a failure not of de dicto motivation itself but of sensitivity in communication and, perhaps, of the moral virtues of tact and fellow-feeling that accompany, though are not identical with, moral worth.\n\nObjection 2: A dutiful agent could be a hyper-rigid moralist indifferent to context, e.g., an inquisitor who tortures because he believes morality demands it.  If the inquisitor\u2019s motive is de dicto, doesn\u2019t your view imply his actions have moral worth?\n\nReply: No, because sufficiency requires correct reasons-responsiveness.  The inquisitor\u2019s deliberation is corrupted: he misidentifies the right-making features.  Moral worth is conditional on the agent\u2019s having a justified (or at least reasonable) grasp of what is right.  A systematically mistaken agent fails the epistemic sensitivity condition.\n\nObjection 3: What about the agent who programs herself with a \u201crightness microchip\u201d that triggers action mechanically whenever the property \u201crequired\u201d is detected by external experts?  She acts from a desire to do right yet lacks understanding.  Is that praiseworthy?\n\nReply: Understanding is integral to reasons-responsiveness.  Automated compliance does not constitute acting for reasons; it bypasses the agent\u2019s rational capacities and so lacks the quality of will that grounds moral appraisal.  A merely causal connection between the belief \u201cThis is right\u201d and behavior is insufficient; it must be the agent\u2019s recognizing and endorsing the belief as a reason.\n\n8. Conclusion  \n\nA desire to do what morality requires, taken in isolation, can look abstract or fetishistic.  But when we attend to its functional role in deliberation\u2014its capacity to integrate diverse right-making considerations, to express respect for persons, and to manifest rational self-governance\u2014we see that it can fully ground moral worth.  The de dicto motive is not a pale substitute for de re concern; it is the structural feature that allows concern, justice, and other values to bear the weight of obligation.  Praiseworthy agents need not wear their hearts on their sleeves.  It is enough that, moved by duty, they reliably and understandingly act as morality requires.  Far from representing alienation, such agency exemplifies the very heart of moral life: the exercise of our capacity to recognize and respond to reasons that we share with others as free and equal persons.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 0, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 3803, "reasoning_tokens": 576}
{"question_id": "ISSEROW-MORALWORTH-2020", "question": "Many philosophers have argued that the motive of duty\u2014understood as a de dicto desire to do what is morally right\u2014cannot suffice for moral worth. On their view, praiseworthy agents must be motivated by the concrete considerations that explain why their actions are right (such as concern for others' welfare), rather than by an abstract concern for morality as such. Critics charge that agents motivated solely by duty exhibit a kind of moral fetishism or alienation from what morality is really about. Can acting solely from a desire to do what is morally right suffice as a motive for morally worthy conduct? If so, what makes such dutiful action praiseworthy?", "answer": "Can the bare desire to do what is morally right\u2014what contemporary moral psychologists call a de dicto moral motive\u2014ground morally worthy action? Or are we forced to say, with many recent critics, that someone motivated only \u201cbecause it is right\u201d exhibits a kind of moral fetishism or relational alienation that disqualifies her for moral praise? I shall defend the sufficiency thesis: an agent who acts solely from the desire to do what is morally right can, under certain fairly ordinary conditions, perform actions that possess full moral worth. Doing so, however, requires clarifying what a de dicto moral motive really is, why it is not the pathological object\u2010fixation its opponents portray, and how it can anchor the key dimensions of praiseworthiness\u2014namely, responsiveness to moral reasons, reliability across circumstances, and the expression of an agent\u2019s practical identity.\n\nI\n\nCritics of duty\u2010centered moral motivation often deploy two rhetorically powerful charges. The first is fetishism: the dutiful agent allegedly treats \u201crightness\u201d as a mysterious, sui generis property detached from the substantive values\u2014others\u2019 welfare, freedom, honesty\u2014 that make particular acts right. The second is alienation: by extracting herself from concern for concrete persons or projects and directing her attention to \u201cmorality as such,\u201d she risks estrangement from the very sources of meaning that morality should protect and nourish. These worries, voiced in different registers by Bernard Williams, Michael Stocker, Nomy Arpaly, and Sarah Stroud, have convinced many philosophers that the most admirable agents are moved directly by the goods their actions realize, not by a formal respect for rightness.\n\nYet there is an older, equally potent strand of moral thought that champions the motive of duty. In Kant\u2019s Groundwork, the good will is praised precisely because it acts \u201cfrom duty,\u201d that is, from respect for the moral law. Twentieth-century Kantians such as Barbara Herman and Onora O\u2019Neill have refined this idea, arguing that a principled commitment to rightness is what immunizes us against the distorting pull of self\u2010interest, partiality, and moral luck. If the critic is correct, the Kantian tradition misfires at the very point where it hoped to offer an ideal of agency. My goal is to show that no such reductio succeeds: the Kantian insights can be preserved once we disentangle misconceptions about the psychology of the de dicto motive.\n\nII\n\nBegin with a conceptual clarification. A de dicto desire to do what is right is not a placeholder desire whose content is forever indeterminate. It is a second\u2010order practical commitment: \u201cLet it be the case, of any action A open to me, that if A is morally required, I do A (because it is so required).\u201d To be action-guiding, this commitment must be coupled with an ordinary capacity to discover which concrete considerations make particular options morally required. A competent moral agent therefore cannot rest with the abstract thought \u201cI must do the right thing\u201d and remain clueless about what the right thing is. She must deploy empirical knowledge, sensitivity to context, and practical imagination to determine, for instance, that repaying a debt matters because it respects the creditor\u2019s autonomy, or that telling a painful truth matters because deception undermines trust. Put differently, de dicto motivation is mediated by de re recognition of the very considerations the critic claims it neglects.\n\nThe relation is analogous to a mathematician\u2019s de dicto desire to prove only true theorems. Wanting to prove \u201cwhatever is true\u201d is hardly fetishistic; it is an organizing ideal that steers the mathematician to attend to the structure of particular proofs, axioms, and counterexamples. Similarly, the moral idealist\u2019s commitment to moral rightness directs her attention to the reasons that constitute rightness in given circumstances.\n\nRecognizing this built-in dependence vitiates the fetishism charge. The dutiful agent is not fascinated by an occult property called \u201crightness\u201d any more than the mathematician is fascinated by truistic \u201ctruth.\u201d What motivates her is the normative authority of reasons, whose instantiation in concrete cases she must discern. This discursive, rule-sensitive, and fallible process is the very opposite of a fetish; it embodies epistemic humility and practical openness.\n\nIII\n\nEven if the fetishism objection fails, the alienation worry might persist: does acting from duty estrange us from personal relationships and the goods of love, friendship, and solidarity that seem intrinsically motivating? Consider Williams\u2019s famous example of the husband who visits his wife in the hospital solely because he judges it morally required. Intuitively, the critics say, the best explanation for the husband\u2019s visit ought to be affectionate concern, not deontic calculation. The dutiful husband seems cold, even contemptible.\n\nWe should grant the phenomenological force of this example while resisting its normative conclusion. First, the scenario is stylized to heighten the sense of chill: the husband is depicted as motivated only by duty in contexts where partial affections would be more fitting. But the sufficiency thesis claims that de dicto motivation can ground moral worth, not that it always manifests perfection in every domain of value. Even in Williams\u2019s case, if the husband\u2019s affection has temporarily waned\u2014say, he is exhausted, ambivalent, or depressed\u2014yet he nonetheless visits from duty, that fact is praiseworthy, not blameworthy. We admire him for allowing the moral claim latent in marriage promises to govern action despite flagging sentiment. The charge of alienation trades on the assumption that healthy relationships must be exclusively affection-driven. In reality, human loves are vulnerable, and duty stabilizes them.\n\nMoreover, the moral point of duty is not to supplant personal concern but to integrate and discipline it. Kantian respect functions as a regulative ideal, ensuring that affection does not slide into possessiveness, favoritism, or disregard for the vulnerable. A parent who vaccinates a child \u201cbecause it is her duty\u201d is not alienated from the child\u2019s good; she recognizes that genuine concern must be expressed in ways consonant with public health requirements and justice to other children. Far from crowding out affection, duty can refine it.\n\nIV\n\nWe can now build a positive account of why action motivated solely by respect for rightness can be morally worthy. I propose three interlocking dimensions: transparency to moral reasons, reliability, and identity expression.\n\n1. Transparency to reasons. For an action to possess moral worth, it must be non-accidental with respect to the moral reasons that make it right. De dicto motivation satisfies this condition by tracking the moral property of the act under the very description that explains its rightness. Take an agent who returns a lost wallet because she knows it is morally required. She is moved precisely by the fact that returning the wallet is morally obligatory; therefore her motivational pathway features the normative property as a premiss. The act is not merely coincidentally right (as when someone returns the wallet to impress onlookers). Moral worth accrues when the agent\u2019s will is governed by the right-making considerations as such; the de dicto desire does the job.\n\n2. Reliability. Praise typically attaches not to isolated lucky choices but to stable dispositions that would manifest across a range of similar cases. Acting from a settled desire to do the right thing is, ceteris paribus, more reliable than acting from any particular sympathetic feeling, which might ebb in less vivid contexts. Insofar as the dutiful motive is principle\u2010centered, it can survive changes in mood, personal circumstances, and perceived social reward. That reliability is a positive moral feature: it signals commitment rather than caprice.\n\n3. Identity expression. Finally, moral worth involves the expression of an agent\u2019s evaluative identity, the deep structure of her will. Respect for moral rightness can itself be a constitutive feature of a person\u2019s self\u2010conception. We admire figures such as Socrates, Elizabeth Fry, or Nelson Mandela not because they were brimming with undifferentiated benevolence, but because they identified themselves with justice as such. Their de dicto orientation expressed who they were. The same can occur in everyday lives: a cashier refuses to cheat customers \u201cbecause it isn\u2019t right,\u201d thereby affirming a self\u2010image of honesty that shapes interactions far beyond the single case.\n\nV\n\nHaving outlined the positive case, it is important to refine the sufficiency thesis so that it neither collapses into triviality nor becomes implausibly broad.\n\nCondition One: Normative Competence. The agent must possess adequate epistemic access to moral reasons. A person who blindly follows whatever she happens to label \u201cthe right thing\u201d lacks moral worth, because her desire, though de dicto, is detached from justified beliefs about rightness. This is not a concession to the fetishism critic; it is a straightforward point about practical rationality. Desire without understanding is mere aspiration, not agency.\n\nCondition Two: Independence from Countervailing Immoral Motives. Moral worth is especially salient when de dicto motivation overrides impulses that conflict with duty\u2014temptations to lie, profit, or avoid inconvenience. If the agent\u2019s only motive is to do right and no competing motive is present, we still have moral worth; but the more the agent must wrestle with obstacles, the clearer her praise. Kant\u2019s famous example of the cold-hearted but honest shopkeeper illustrates this: we value his honesty precisely because economic self-interest pulled in the opposite direction.\n\nCondition Three: Noninstrumentality. The desire to do what is right must not be subordinate to ulterior ends such as reputation or divine reward. Otherwise, the act\u2019s moral property is not the motivating ground but a mere means. In such a case, the agent manipulates morality rather than respects it; her action is heteronomous and loses worth. A genuine de dicto desire treats rightness as final.\n\nUnder these conditions, solely dutiful action is praiseworthy. Notice that nothing in the conditions requires supplementary de re motives such as empathy or friendship, though nothing forbids them either. The de dicto motive\u2019s sufficiency is preserved.\n\nVI\n\nA lingering worry is that my account ignores richer, virtue-ethical conceptions of moral excellence. Virtues like kindness or courage seem to be inherently de re: the kind person is directly moved by others\u2019 suffering, the courageous person by the good to be secured through risk. Does the sufficiency thesis imply that virtue is dispensable?\n\nNo. The relationship is better cast in terms of hierarchy rather than competition. A de dicto desire to do what is right can underwrite and coordinate more particularistic motives. Indeed, many moral traditions hold that the cultivation of virtue is itself a duty; thus, the dutiful agent will normally seek to develop spontaneous concern for others, temperate habits, and so forth. Yet in moments where virtue has not fully matured or is momentarily suppressed, duty can perform a \u201cback-up\u201d regulatory role. In that sense, moral worth grounded in duty is compatible with, and even conducive to, the flourishing of de re motives. The sufficiency thesis does not deny the additional value of richer motives; it only denies their necessity for praiseworthiness.\n\nVII\n\nI turn briefly to objections rooted in moral phenomenology. Critics sometimes say that the inner experience of acting from duty feels strained or joyless, suggesting a deficiency. But moral phenomenology is heterogeneous. Many report a profound sense of purposiveness, even joy, when they succeed in doing what they judge morally required despite obstacles. Kant calls this the \u201cpleasure of respect.\u201d Contemporary empirical studies on moral integrity corroborate the finding: subjects who act on principle often report increased self-esteem and long-term well-being. To dismiss such experiences a priori as inauthentic is question-begging. At minimum, phenomenological data are mixed and cannot settle the issue.\n\nVIII\n\nAnother cluster of objections appeals to moral education. Children, the argument goes, learn morality most effectively by attuning to concrete harms and goods, not by manipulating abstract deontic concepts. Grant the pedagogical point; it does not follow that adult moral worth requires the same motivational profile. Mathematics education likewise begins with counting pebbles before progressing to group theory; it does not follow that mature mathematicians should still count pebbles. Developmental sequencing is not constitutive of ideal competence.\n\nIX\n\nSome worry that my view incarnates a form of externalism about reasons: how can an abstract desire latch onto concrete reasons without some pre-existing concern for those reasons? The answer lies in the nature of practical reflection. The de dicto desire functions as a standing directive: \u201cIdentify and comply with whatever reasons there are.\u201d The directive is satisfied only if the agent, through reflection, takes those reasons as reasons. Thus, rather than free-floating, the de dicto desire generates occasions for recognition and uptake. The structure is essentially that of a second-order volition \u00e0 la Frankfurt: the agent wills to be motivated by moral reasons, and this willing entails first-order dispositional readiness to be moved by them once apprehended. No mysterious external connection is required.\n\nX\n\nFinally, one might interpret the sufficiency thesis as elitist, favoring cerebral rule-worshippers over ordinary warmhearted folks. But the thesis is about sufficiency, not ranking. Nothing here implies that the only praiseworthy people are Kantians. A mother who lovingly tends her child because she adores her child does something excellent and praiseworthy\u2014even if she never entertains a thought about duty. The point is simply that a different, equally accessible motivational route\u2014acting \u201cfrom duty alone\u201d\u2014can also yield genuine moral worth.\n\nXI\n\nConclusion\n\nWe can now synthesize the argument. Acting solely from the desire to do what is morally right can suffice for moral worth because:\n\na. The de dicto moral motive necessarily engages the agent with the very concrete considerations that make actions right, thereby satisfying the transparency requirement and avoiding fetishism.\n\nb. It grounds a reliable disposition to align action with moral reasons across variable circumstances, a hallmark of praiseworthy character.\n\nc. It expresses a valuable aspect of personal identity: principled self-governance oriented to the authority of moral norms.\n\nd. Under plausible constraints\u2014normative competence, independence from corrupting motives, and noninstrumentality\u2014such action fulfills the conditions for being meaningfully praise-worthy.\n\nNeither the fetishism nor the alienation objections withstand scrutiny once we appreciate the embedded, relational, and self-expressive nature of the duty motive. The Kantian insight\u2014that reverence for morality as such is a locus of moral excellence\u2014remains intact. Equally, acknowledging the sufficiency of de dicto motivation does not marginalize de re virtues; it simply secures a place for a complementary, sometimes indispensable, mode of moral agency. In our messy moral world, where empathy runs dry and personal ties falter, it is good\u2014indeed worthy of praise\u2014that some people still ask, simple and direct, \u201cWhat is the right thing to do?\u201d and then do it because it is right.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 1, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 3768, "reasoning_tokens": 640}

Can acting solely from a desire to do what is morally right suffice as a motive for morally worthy conduct? If so, what makes such dutiful action praiseworthy?", "answer": "1. Introduction: the intuitive worry\n\nSuppose Samantha notices that a stranger has been badly injured in a traffic accident. She immediately applies first aid, calls an ambulance, and waits with the victim until help arrives. When later asked why she did all this she replies, quite sincerely, \u2018Because it was the morally right thing to do.\u2019 Some spectators think her answer reveals admirable single-mindedness; others find it oddly chilly. They would have preferred her to say that she acted out of compassion for the stranger\u2019s pain. The second reaction lies behind the charge that a merely de dicto desire\u2014to do whatever is right\u2014can never ground fully admirable conduct. Where is Samantha\u2019s concern for the concrete human being in front of her? Where is the warmth or love or sympathy that, many believe, gives morality its point? Acting \u2018from duty alone\u2019, these critics say, smacks of moral fetishism or alienation.\n\nIn what follows I defend the claim that a pure desire to do what is right can, in at least some cases, suffice for moral worth. To make that plausible I undertake four tasks: (i) clarify what it means to act from the motive of duty, distinguishing de dicto and de re moral motivation; (ii) reconstruct the main anti-Kantian objections\u2014fetishism, motivational poverty, and alienation; (iii) show why those objections are not decisive by developing a positive account of how a de dicto moral motive can display sensitivity to the very same considerations that its critics prize; and (iv) explain why such action is, on that account, genuinely praiseworthy.\n\n2. De dicto versus de re moral motivation\n\nPhilosophers often distinguish two kinds of moral desire:\n\n\u2022 De re: a first-order concern for the particular features that make an action right\u2014e.g., the injured stranger\u2019s pain, a friend\u2019s need, an environmental disaster.  \n\u2022 De dicto: a higher-order, content-neutral desire that one\u2019s conduct conform to whatever morality demands; the focus is on rightness \u2018under that description.\u2019\n\nKantians typically valorise the de dicto desire. Kant claims that an action has \u2018moral worth\u2019 only if it is done \u2018from duty\u2019\u2014that is, because one recognises and is moved by the thought that duty requires it. Critics, however, suspect that leaving everything at the de dicto level gets things backwards: morality is about concrete persons and interests, not about rightness in the abstract. On their view, to care merely about \u2018the right\u2019 is like admiring a painting solely because one was told it is valuable, rather than because one sees its beauty.\n\n3. The standard objections\n\na) Fetishism (Smith, Arpaly, Railton)  \nThe moral fetishist is unhealthily pre-occupied with a property\u2014rightness\u2014as such. Like someone attracted not to persons but to the fact that they wear police uniforms, the fetishist focuses on a formal feature and is blind to what gives that feature point. Sympathy, friendship, love or justice are thereby slighted.\n\nb) Motivational impoverishment (Stocker\u2019s \u2018schizophrenia\u2019)  \nMichael Stocker argues that modern moral theories make agents schizophrenic: they recommend that we do loving things for our friends, yet they tell us that the ultimately correct motive is to maximise utility or do one\u2019s duty. Such detachment prevents genuine human relationships. To visit a friend in hospital only because duty calls is to fail the very ideal of friendship.\n\nc) Alienation (Williams)  \nBernard Williams worries that moral theories which demand a standing readiness to set aside one\u2019s personal projects in favour of an abstract impartial standard alienate the agent from her identity-conferring commitments. Acting merely from duty thus threatens an existential dis-integration.\n\n4. Two preliminary clarifications\n\nFirst, the debate is not over whether duty can coexist with sympathy or love. Everyone agrees that Samantha could be moved simultaneously by compassion and by the thought that it is right to help. The narrow question is whether the latter motive alone can ever suffice for moral worth when the former is absent.\n\nSecond, \u2018suffice\u2019 does not mean \u2018always best.\u2019 It means \u2018good enough for full moral praise in at least some circumstances.\u2019 \u220e\n\n5. A Kantian-inspired defence\n\nI submit that pure dutiful agency can be morally admirable because it embodies three interconnected excellences.\n\n5.1. Practical recognition respect\n\nStephen Darwall distinguishes \u2018appraisal respect\u2019 (a warm attitude of esteem) from \u2018recognition respect\u2019 (a disposition to treat something as setting constraints on one\u2019s conduct). To act from duty is to give recognition respect to the moral law. One thereby acknowledges the equal authority of every person\u2019s claims, including those who fail to grip one\u2019s sympathy. When Samantha helps the stranger merely because it is right, she demonstrates a laudable non-partial responsiveness to persons as such. Far from slighting the concrete victim, she honours him precisely as a bearer of moral standing, and she does so independently of contingent affective ties.\n\n5.2. Reliability under partiality-defeating conditions\n\nSympathy is unstable: we feel it more for the nearby than for the distant, more for the cute than for the unlovely. A de dicto moral desire functions as a stabiliser that keeps moral performance on track when first-order sentiments misfire. Think of a triage doctor exhausted after 48 hours; her empathic reserves are drained, but her sense of duty keeps her equitably treating each patient. The very impersonality of the motive is what secures dependability. Moral worth plausibly increases with the robustness of one\u2019s responsiveness to the right-making reasons; therefore an impartial de dicto desire, by counteracting parochial biases, can ground praiseworthy steadiness.\n\n5.3. Second-order evaluative guidance\n\nEven when de dicto desire is the sole occurrent motive, it need not be ignorant of the concrete grounds of rightness. It can operate as a second-order directive: \u2018Do whatever the reasons demand.\u2019 To execute that instruction the agent must attend to, weigh, and be guided by the first-order reasons themselves\u2014otherwise she could not reliably identify which act is right. Duty, so understood, is no blind fetish; it is a standing commitment to practical reason. Acting from duty thus manifests the agent\u2019s rational capacities: sensitivity to evidence, capacity for impartial justification, and responsiveness to critique.\n\n6. Replying to the three objections\n\na) To fetishism: The above shows that the dutiful agent\u2019s focus on rightness is not an erotic fixation on an inert property; it is a respect for the set of considerations that constitute rightness. The de dicto desire is like a good scientist\u2019s desire for truth: it is formally defined, yet it directs the scientist to concrete empirical facts. A doctor who wants \u2018the correct diagnosis\u2019 is not alienated from her patient\u2019s symptoms; on the contrary, that very desire makes her attend carefully to them. Likewise, a desire that one\u2019s conduct be right sends one straight into the thick of real human concerns.\n\nb) To motivational impoverishment: Visiting a friend solely from duty might indeed betray something defective about the friendship. But that verdict presupposes the special role that love ought to play in that particular relation. Not every moral context is like friendship. In many cases\u2014paying taxes, jury duty, rescuing strangers\u2014what morality requires is precisely an impersonal stance. Praiseworthiness varies with role. The worry confuses a species of partial relationship-value with the genus of moral value.\n\nc) To alienation: A standing commitment to do what is right is not an alien force; it is an integral component of practical identity. Christine Korsgaard argues that reflective beings inevitably act under some conception of what is normatively warranted; the moral law, when endorsed, becomes part of the self. Hence doing one\u2019s duty is not self-betrayal but self-constitution.\n\n7. The Markovits thesis: good will as de dicto\n\nSarah Paul and Julia Markovits sharpen the defence: what matters is not the object of the desire (a de re property) but the quality of will reflected in how the agent responds to the reasons she believes decisive. A de dicto moral desire embodies the good will because it shows that the agent is moved by moral reasons as such. Provided her belief about what morality requires is correct and non-accidental, the resulting act has moral worth.\n\nYet one might object: two agents can share a de dicto motive while one stumbles onto the truth and the other tracks it competently. Here we reach an important refinement: moral worth demands reason-responsiveness, not lucky conformity. If duty moves Samantha to act but she could easily have mistaken what duty demanded in slightly different circumstances, her action is less praiseworthy. A desire to do what is right must be embedded in a broader virtue of conscientiousness\u2014attentiveness to morally relevant facts, openness to criticism, willingness to correct error. Fetishism is avoided not by importing sympathy but by enriching the de dicto motive with epistemic virtues.\n\n8. Why de dicto motivation sometimes outshines de re\n\nConsider three scenarios.\n\n8.1. The impartial rescuer  \nDana dislikes the victim (perhaps the victim had earlier wronged her) and feels no sympathy. Nonetheless, the thought \u2018A person is gravely at risk; it is my duty to help\u2019 moves her to act. Most will agree that Dana is morally worthy\u2014perhaps more so than someone who helps only because she happens to like the victim.\n\n8.2. The justice-driven juror  \nEthan serves on a jury involving a defendant whose ethnicity he distrusts; his gut pulls him toward conviction. Yet Ethan is moved by the desire to do what is right, so he carefully examines the evidence and votes for acquittal. His sole motive is duty. It would be perverse to withhold praise on the ground that he lacked warm feelings toward the defendant.\n\n8.3. Moral uncertainty  \nFiona faces a policy decision involving complex climate data. No concrete sentiment offers guidance. Her motive is: \u2018I must adopt whichever policy is morally best, all things considered.\u2019 She commissions further research, weighs competing arguments, and chooses the option with the strongest impartial reasons. De re benevolence is too unspecific here; de dicto conscientiousness is what drives the morally serious inquiry.\n\nThese cases illustrate that the impersonality of duty can not only suffice but sometimes rescue moral deliberation from the partiality and opacity of first-order sentiments.\n\n9. Objection: Couldn\u2019t a fanatic equally act from a de dicto moral desire?\n\nIndeed, the terrorist who blows up a market \u2018because it is morally required\u2019 is also acting from duty as he conceives it. Must we praise him? No. The sufficiency thesis is conditional: the motive of duty suffices for moral worth only if (i) the agent\u2019s substantive moral belief is correct (or at least epistemically reasonable), and (ii) the belief is held and acted upon with the right kind of reflection and respect for others as rational equals. Fanaticism fails both tests: its beliefs are false and its deliberative posture excludes critical engagement. The fanatic\u2019s will is bad not because it is de dicto but because it is irrational and disrespectful.\n\n10. Objectivity, fallibility, and humility\n\nThe de dicto desire has another virtue: it incorporates a structural humility. One who is essentially committed to \u2018whatever is right\u2019 acknowledges that she might be mistaken about particular cases; hence she stays alert to reasons, argument, and evidence. In contrast, an agent who is simply moved by sympathy may, when corrected about the implications of her act, reply, \u2018But I feel so sorry for him!\u2019 Moral progress across history often depended on agents whose paramount motive was to do what was right and who therefore allowed new arguments\u2014about slavery, women\u2019s suffrage, animal cruelty\u2014to overturn comfortable intuitions.\n\n11. Integration with other motives\n\nThe strongest defence of duty need not recommend motivational monism. A mature moral agent integrates de dicto and de re concerns. But integration entails hierarchy: when sympathy clashes with duty, duty rightly overrides. The charge that pure duty involves a lack of \u2018warmth\u2019 mistakes sufficiency for exclusivity. A motive can be sufficient for praise without being optimal for all-things-considered human flourishing. Analogously, knowing how to drive safely is sufficient for being a good driver, even if knowing also how to enjoy scenic routes makes one a better driver still.\n\n12. Why such conduct is praiseworthy\n\nPraiseworthiness supervenes on the agent\u2019s quality of will\u2014her dispositions to recognise, weigh, and respond to moral reasons. A pure desire to do what is right embodies four commendable features:\n\n1. Impartiality: It respects persons as equals, not as objects of sentimental preference.  \n2. Stability: It guides action when emotions falter or mislead.  \n3. Reflectivity: It incorporates openness to evidence and self-correction.  \n4. Self-governance: It manifests the capacity to act from principle rather than impulse.\n\nThese characteristics are constitutive of moral virtue; praise is therefore fitting.\n\n13. Conclusion\n\nThe accusation that the motive of duty inevitably produces moral fetishism mistakes a formal description of the motive for its substantive operation. When properly understood, a de dicto desire to do what is right is neither blind nor bloodless: it expresses respect for persons, keeps action aligned with impartial reasons, and embodies the intellectual humility necessary for moral learning. Because these attributes bear directly on the moral worth of action, we are justified in praising agents who act solely from duty, at least when other virtuous motives are unavailable or unreliable. What ultimately matters is not whether the spring of action is abstract or concrete, but whether it conduces to a rational, respectful, and stable responsiveness to moral reasons. In that respect the Kantian insight stands: good will\u2014conceived as the steadfast commitment to do what is right\u2014remains a sufficient, though not exclusive, ground of moral worth.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 2, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 3368, "reasoning_tokens": 448}
{"question_id": "ISSEROW-MORALWORTH-2020", "question": "Many philosophers have argued that the motive of duty\u2014understood as a de dicto desire to do what is morally right\u2014cannot suffice for moral worth. On their view, praiseworthy agents must be motivated by the concrete considerations that explain why their actions are right (such as concern for others' welfare), rather than by an abstract concern for morality as such. Critics charge that agents motivated solely by duty exhibit a kind of moral fetishism or alienation from what morality is really about. Can acting solely from a desire to do what is morally right suffice as a motive for morally worthy conduct? If so, what makes such dutiful action praiseworthy?", "answer": "1. Introduction  \n\nFew doctrines in moral psychology have been as resilient\u2014or as embattled\u2014as the Kantian thought that an action\u2019s worth depends on its being done \u201cfrom duty.\u201d  The view appears, on the one hand, to capture something exalted in ordinary moral admiration: we praise the person who keeps a painful promise because she must, not because she happens to relish doing so.  Yet many contemporary philosophers\u2014from Michael Stocker\u2019s charge of \u201cmoral schizophrenia,\u201d to Michael Smith\u2019s complaint of \u201cmoral fetishism,\u201d to Susan Wolf\u2019s portrait of the \u201cmoral saint\u201d\u2014maintain that a merely de dicto longing to do whatever morality requires is impoverished.  Morality, they say, is about concrete relational goods: relieving a child\u2019s fear, respecting a colleague\u2019s autonomy, preserving a friend\u2019s life.  Someone who helps simply because \u201cthat is what morality calls for\u201d appears estranged from what truly matters in the situation.  \n\nThis essay argues that the de dicto motive of duty can, by itself, suffice for moral worth.  I do not claim that it is always superior to more concrete motives, nor that agents with richer emotional repertoires could not be better.  I claim only that exclusive reliance on duty need not rob an action of praiseworthiness.  I defend this thesis in four steps.\n\n1. I first analyze the distinction between de dicto and de re moral motivation and their connection to moral worth.  \n2. I reconstruct three principal objections: the fetishism objection, the alienation objection, and the epistemic impotence objection.  \n3. I then supply four positive arguments showing why a pure motive of duty can ground moral worth: (a) its rational structure expresses recognition of moral authority; (b) it secures impartial reliability; (c) it embodies a valuable form of second-personal respect; and (d) it displays a distinctive kind of practical wisdom.  \n4. Finally, I explain how the dutiful agent avoids fetishism and alienation by embedding her de dicto commitment in a broader practical identity, even while the de dicto desire alone does the motivational work on a given occasion.\n\nThroughout, I assume a broadly Kantian conception of moral worth: an action is morally worthy when it expresses the agent\u2019s virtuous character\u2014where virtue is understood in terms of responsiveness to reasons\u2014in a way for which the agent can be appropriately praised.\n\n2. De dicto vs. de re motivation  \n\nLet us sharpen the oft-invoked contrast.  An agent acts from a de re moral motive when she is moved by the very considerations that make the action right.  If she visits her elderly neighbor because she cares about his loneliness, the loneliness\u2014the de re content\u2014directly motivates her.  By contrast, an agent acts from a de dicto moral motive when what moves her is the propositional attitude, \u201cthat this is the morally right thing to do,\u201d irrespective of which first-order considerations make it right.  She wills the right as such.\n\nTwo clarifications are essential.\n\na. The distinction concerns the content that motivates, not the agent\u2019s cognitive access.  One can fully know why an act is right and still be moved by the abstract normative status rather than by the concrete facts.  \n\nb. De dicto motivation need not be egoistic or heteronomous.  The agent does not say, \u201cI want to score moral points,\u201d but \u201cI must do what morality requires\u201d\u2014a desire shaped by a conception of herself as subject to moral law.  \n\n3. Three objections to de dicto sufficiency  \n\n3.1 Moral fetishism (Smith)  \nSmith claims that being moved simply by the rightness of an act treats rightness as a fetish object: it fixes motivation on a \u201cmoral property\u201d instead of the substantive features\u2014others\u2019 suffering, broken promises\u2014that confer the property.  That, he contends, betrays a failure to respond to the world\u2019s morally salient features.\n\n3.2 Alienation (Stocker and Wolf)  \nStocker\u2019s well-known hospital example imagines a friend visiting only \u201cbecause it is my duty.\u201d  The patient feels alienated: the friend\u2019s visit inherits a chill, lacking warmth or concern.  Wolf further argues that an exclusive preoccupation with doing the morally best thing crowds out non-moral goods, crippling the agent\u2019s capacity for friendship or humor.\n\n3.3 Epistemic impotence  \nFinally, critics worry that a de dicto desire is too indeterminate to guide action.  Morality requires grasping which concrete considerations matter; an abstract \u201cdo the right thing\u201d cannot, by itself, tell us what to do.  It therefore cannot explain timely, sensitive performance.\n\nI take these objections seriously.  The defense of dutiful sufficiency must show (i) that rightness-regarding desire is not fetishistic, (ii) that it can incorporate respect and concern in ways that avoid alienation, and (iii) that it is epistemically efficacious.\n\n4. Four positive arguments  \n\n4.1 Recognition of moral authority  \n\nAt the heart of morality\u2014especially on Kantian lines\u2014is the idea that moral demands are categorically authoritative.  To be moral is, first, to recognize that authority and, second, to will in accordance with it.  A de dicto desire to do what is right precisely embodies that recognition: it is the standing disposition to let moral considerations govern choice, whatever they turn out to be.  When such a disposition issues in action, the action manifests the agent\u2019s principled self-governance.  That fact alone merits praise, for it displays a fundamental virtue: respect for the moral law.\n\nImportantly, the de re motives the critics champion (sympathy, love, solidarity) acquire moral salience precisely because, rightly structured, they track what morality requires.  If so, then the primary locus of moral worth cannot be the concrete sentiment per se, but the agent\u2019s responsiveness to normative reasons.  The de dicto motive enables that responsiveness in its most general form.  We can thus see it as the architectonic virtue undergirding all others: a commitment to give decisive weight to moral reasons across circumstances.\n\n4.2 Impartial reliability  \n\nSecond, an exclusive motive of duty can secure a robustness that concrete sentiments often lack.  Sympathy, for instance, is known to be partial: we empathize more with those who resemble us or whose faces we can see.  Friend-concern favors intimates; love favors lovers.  While such partiality is not always vicious, there are many cases\u2014distributing scarce medicine, adjudicating rights\u2014where morality asks us to bracket them.  Because a de dicto motive tracks rightness rather than affect, it can motivate correct action when concrete affections misfire or are silent.  Its impartiality underwrites reliability, the very feature Kant stresses in the case of the melancholy philanthropist who aids others despite lacking any sympathetic feeling.  That reliability is itself praiseworthy, for it makes the agent a trustworthy bearer of moral responsibility.\n\nNote that reliability is counterfactual: we esteem the dutiful person not merely because she helped today, but because we believe she would help tomorrow even if the victim were someone she disliked.  A purely de re sympathetic motive cannot guarantee that; the de dicto one can.\n\n4.3 Second-personal respect  \n\nA third virtue of acting from duty is that it can manifest a distinctive form of respect for persons, captured nicely by Stephen Darwall\u2019s \u201csecond-personal\u201d account of moral obligations.  To act from duty is, inter alia, to recognize another\u2019s authority to demand certain treatment from one.  That recognition is not primarily a matter of being moved by their welfare (a benevolent stance) but by the claim they are entitled to press (a deontic stance).  When I keep a promise because it is right, I acknowledge you as a co-rational agent whose expectations impose genuine constraints on me.  That form of regard can be absent in purely de re motivations focused on welfare.  The dutiful promiser conveys, \u201cYou matter as a self-governing person,\u201d not merely, \u201cI care about your happiness.\u201d  Respect is a moral good, and its expression is a fitting ground for praise.\n\n4.4 Practical wisdom under uncertainty  \n\nFinally, the epistemic objection can be turned on its head.  In real decision making, we often face morally relevant facts we only dimly grasp; our affective responses are noisy.  A standing policy of doing what is right functions as a kind of higher-order control, guiding deliberation toward discovering the relevant concrete reasons.  Philosophers sometimes depict the de dicto desire as one that floats free of such discovery, but an intelligent moral agent treats it as a demand to engage in conscientious inquiry: \u201cI aim to do what is right; therefore I must determine what is right here.\u201d  Having such a higher-order aim is epistemically fruitful, not impotent, analogous to a scientist\u2019s commitment to believe what the evidence supports.  The motive of duty thus expresses practical wisdom: it integrates motivation with the regulative ideal of correct action.\n\nWe can put the point in terms of counterfactual sensitivity: if, after investigation, the agent learned that the concrete facts made a different act right, the pure de dicto motive would seamlessly redirect her will.  De re motives, tied to specific features, need not; sympathetic feeling for this child\u2019s distress will not, by itself, redirect to saving two strangers elsewhere.  The capacity to track moral truth across informational updates is a virtue we properly admire.\n\n5. Defusing the objections  \n\n5.1 Against fetishism  \n\nWhy is de dicto rightness not a fetish?  Because the dutiful agent values rightness not as an alluring property but as the property of being supported by decisive reasons.  The fetishist\u2019s desire is insensitive to why the act is right; the dutiful agent\u2019s desire, properly understood, is defined by the norm that the reasons in favor of the act are sufficient.  That concept is not a \u201cshallow evaluative property\u201d in Smith\u2019s sense; it is a reference to whatever reasons there are, thus implicitly encompassing the concrete features.  To call that stance fetishistic is to confuse a higher-order appreciation of reason\u2019s authority with an obsession over an occult object.\n\n5.2 Against alienation  \n\nDoes duty alienate friends?  Sometimes\u2014but it need not.  Nothing in the claim \u201cI help you because it is right\u201d precludes also communicating warmth.  Moreover, consider the symmetric case where what morality requires diverges from personal affection\u2014delivering unpleasant truths, terminating an unsafe friendship, or reporting a colleague\u2019s misconduct.  Here the friend may rightly appreciate that one is acting from duty; affection alone would be suspect.  Far from alienating, the sense that another will treat me justly even when the chips are down can deepen trust.\n\nStill, Stocker\u2019s phenomenology has a point: exclusive verbal avowal of duty can feel cold.  The solution is not to deny duty\u2019s moral worth but to note that praise and interpersonal comfort are different goods.  A surgeon might save a life with perfect skill and win moral admiration even as her bedside manner leaves something to be desired.  Similarly, the dutiful agent may be praiseworthy though not maximally amiable.  And nothing prevents cultivating both duty and warmth; the fact that the latter sweetens the act does not show that the former is insufficient for moral worth.\n\n5.3 Against epistemic impotence  \n\nWhen critics claim that \u201cdo what is right\u201d is too thin to guide conduct, they mistake an abstract maxim for a full deliberative process.  In practice, the agent who holds herself to the standard of rightness deploys whatever empirical and normative resources she has to figure out what rightness entails.  The commitment is not content-less; it is a directive to perform that very figuring-out.  Thus the dutiful motive is instrumentally and epistemically effective.\n\n6. A qualified sufficiency thesis  \n\nThe conclusion so far is conditional: acting solely from the desire to do what is right can suffice for moral worth provided the desire (i) is suitably informed, (ii) issues in correct action, and (iii) is robustly sensitive to moral reasons.  Why add these conditions?  Because a bare wish to be moral, without reliable sensitivity to reasons, is insufficient; it degenerates into wishful thinking.  But when the conditions obtain, the de dicto motive itself grounds moral worth.\n\nTwo further qualifications merit mention.\n\nFirst, sufficiency is not optimality.  A richly virtuous agent may integrate de re motives\u2014compassion, gratitude, solidarity\u2014alongside duty.  Such integration can enhance the value of her acts.  My claim is only that their absence does not negate worth.\n\nSecond, sufficiency is restricted to moral worth, not aesthetic or relational value.  An action can be morally commendable yet lack affective grace; Stocker\u2019s patient may still feel unloved.  Morality is one evaluative dimension among many.\n\n7. Comparative cases  \n\nConsider three cases to consolidate the argument.\n\nCase A: Melancholy benefactor.  Ann is chronically depressed and feels no sympathy.  Seeing a drowning child, she is moved solely by her resolve to do what duty demands, and she rescues the child.  The act is clearly right.  The de dicto motivation stems from an internalized recognition that others\u2019 lives impose obligations.  It seems harsh to deny moral praise simply because Ann did not feel compassion.  Her perseverance against motivational impediments may even enhance our admiration.\n\nCase B: Principled judge.  Ben recuses himself from a lucrative case involving a friend because he believes judicial impartiality is required.  He is not motivated by affection for the opposing party; indeed, he dislikes them.  His sole motive is respecting the right.  Most of us regard his decision as exemplary, not morally deficient.  The praise attaches to his principled stance\u2014the de dicto motive.\n\nCase C: Charitable epiphany.  Cara reads that malaria nets save lives.  She feels no immediate compassion (the victims are far), but she believes morality requires giving.  She donates.  Here, the de dicto motive is epistemically fruitful: it pushes her to seek information about effective charity.  Again, withholding praise seems implausible.\n\nThese cases illustrate that pure duty can produce moral worth without fetishism or alienation.\n\n8. Objections and replies  \n\nObjection 1:  The agent who acts from duty alone cannot be praised because if she were convinced\u2014however mistakenly\u2014that morality permitted wrongdoing, she would do it.  Her praiseworthiness therefore rests on luck that her belief aligns with moral truth.\n\nReply:  The same \u201cepistemic luck\u201d infects de re motives.  A sympathetic agent who falsely believes euthanasia relieves suffering may wrongly kill.  Moral worth generally presupposes sufficient epistemic justification; the dutiful agent is no worse off.\n\nObjection 2:  De dicto motivation is too easily mimicked by hypocrites who profess love of the right while secretly pursuing self-interest.\n\nReply:  Hypocrisy is a problem of sincerity, not of the motive\u2019s structure.  We can distinguish genuine de dicto desire\u2014demonstrated by consistent counterfactual behavior\u2014from mere profession.  Sincere duty passes the test.\n\n9. The larger picture: autonomy and the unity of virtue  \n\nWhy does the sufficiency thesis matter?  Because it emphasizes an aspect of moral agency crucial to autonomy: the capacity to be governed by self-conscious moral principles.  Aristotelian sentimentalists and Humeans rightly celebrate the ethical importance of cultivating appropriate emotions, but they risk sidelining our status as law-givers for ourselves.  A mature moral life integrates feeling with principle, yet principle retains final authority.  Upholding the sufficiency of dutiful motivation protects that authority.\n\nMoreover, the thesis sheds light on the unity of virtue.  Virtues are unified insofar as they reflect a single practical orientation: the orientation of treating moral reasons as decisive.  The de dicto motive is the abstract form of that orientation.  When this form is present and efficacious, the agent already instantiates the core of virtue, even if some peripheral excellences (cheerful beneficence, graceful speech) are absent.\n\n10. Conclusion  \n\nActing solely from a desire to do what is morally right can indeed suffice for morally worthy conduct.  Such action is praiseworthy because:\n\n1. It manifests recognition of morality\u2019s categorical authority and thus expresses a fundamental virtue of principled self-governance.  \n2. It secures impartial reliability, enabling agents to do right where concrete sentiments fail or mislead.  \n3. It embodies a second-personal form of respect for persons, treating them as bearers of claims, not mere loci of feelings.  \n4. It displays practical wisdom, directing inquiry under conditions of uncertainty and ensuring counterfactual sensitivity to moral reasons.\n\nThe traditional worries of fetishism, alienation, and epistemic thinness lose their grip once we appreciate that a well-formed de dicto motive implicitly encompasses an understanding of the concrete reasons for right action and expresses a valuable moral identity.  While integrating richer emotional motives can enhance moral life, their absence does not deprive dutiful action of worth.  The cold-blooded promise-keeper, the melancholic philanthropist, and the impartial judge each merit our praise, for in acting from duty they vindicate the sovereignty of morality within human agency.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 3, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 3954, "reasoning_tokens": 256}

Can acting solely from a desire to do what is morally right suffice as a motive for morally worthy conduct? If so, what makes such dutiful action praiseworthy?", "answer": "1. Introduction: the dialectic\n\nThat a purely \u201cde dicto\u201d desire\u2014\u201cto do what is right, whatever that is\u201d\u2014could ground morally worthy action is a thesis with illustrious defenders and equally illustrious critics. Kant is standardly read as claiming that only the motive of duty confers moral worth, yet the post-Kantian literature is replete with worries that an agent moved solely by duty would be moralistic, self-involved, or alienated from the very values morality is supposed to protect. Opponents charge that genuine moral worth requires motivation by the concrete considerations that make an act right (e.g. compassion for the suffering, fidelity to friends), not by the abstract consideration that it is morally required.\n\nI shall argue, first, that acting solely from the desire to do what is morally right can indeed suffice for moral worth. Second, I explain what makes such action praiseworthy: (i) it manifests a distinctive form of valuing\u2014respect for the moral, as such\u2014that is itself among the basic moral virtues; (ii) the de dicto form of motivation better secures reliable responsiveness to the whole range of moral reasons in agents with limited epistemic access and fallible affective tendencies; and (iii) it expresses moral autonomy, the capacity to guide oneself by principles one endorses on reflection. These features jointly meet the plausible conditions for praiseworthiness without succumbing to the fetishism or alienation worries.\n\n2. Clarifying the issue\n\n2.1 De dicto versus de re motivation  \nCall a desire de re when it is directed at a particular property or object: \u201cI desire that my friend prosper,\u201d \u201cI desire that no one suffer.\u201d A de dicto desire, by contrast, targets whatever property qualifies under a description: \u201cI desire to do what morality requires, whatever that turns out to be.\u201d The critics grant that de dicto desire is often present alongside de re concern\u2014but insist it cannot by itself ground worth.\n\n2.2 Moral worth and praiseworthiness  \nWe praise agents, roughly, when (a) they do the right thing, (b) their success is non-accidental\u2014i.e. explained by capacities that systematically track the right-making reasons\u2014and (c) those capacities are motivationally attributable to the agent in a way that reveals her values or character. The crucial question, then, is whether a bare desire to do what is right can explain (b) and satisfy (c).\n\n3. The charge of moral fetishism\n\nMichael Smith, following Stocker and Railton, gave the classical articulation: someone moved solely by the fact that donating benefits the poor \u201cbecause it is the right thing to do\u201d seems to fetishize rightness; she treats the moral property as an object of intrinsic fascination and thereby stands affectively at arm\u2019s-length from the poor themselves. Such an attitude allegedly misrepresents morality\u2019s point, which is to protect and promote concrete goods and relationships. Moreover, a fetishist\u2019s motivation seems fragile: if she ceased caring about \u201crightness\u201d she would have no reason to keep her promise or aid the needy.\n\nThese intuitions are powerful but not decisive. They trade on two assumptions: (A) the motive of duty is affectively cold; (B) it abstracts away from the very considerations that make an act right. Both assumptions can be resisted.\n\n4. Why de dicto motivation can suffice\n\n4.1 The value of respect for the moral as such  \nFirst, morality plausibly includes a higher-order value: that agents act out of respect for moral requirements. We do not want beneficent psychopaths whose good deeds are mere accidental side\u2010effects of private urges; we prefer that agents see the moral domain as providing decisive reason. The de dicto desire manifests precisely this respect. Thus, far from being alienating, it engages a moral value: principled regard for moral authority. Respect for law, for promise-keeping as such, or for persons as ends are all higher-order moral attitudes; they cannot be reduced to first-order de re concerns without loss.\n\n4.2 Reliability and epistemic humility  \nSecond, human agents are cognitively limited: we confront partial information, tempting biases, and conflicts of interest. A commitment to do whatever morality requires operates as a regulative second-order desire, continually checking whether our de re sympathies track the wider moral landscape. I might feel no spontaneous compassion for distant strangers, yet my de dicto commitment leads me to recognise their claims. The motive therefore promotes reliable responsiveness to all right-making reasons, not merely the subset my affections happen to latch onto.\n\n4.3 Autonomy and principled self-government  \nThird, acting from duty exhibits moral autonomy\u2014the capacity to guide one\u2019s conduct by principles one endorses on reflection rather than by contingently given impulses. Autonomy is itself of deep moral significance. When someone returns a lost wallet just because she sees that it is required by honesty, she demonstrates that she can bind herself by reasons she recognises, rather than by fear, favour, or sentiment. That capacity merits praise.\n\n5. Meeting the conditions of praiseworthiness\n\n5.1 Non-accidentality  \nSuppose Carla gives ten per cent of her income to famine relief solely because she wants to do her moral duty. Her cognitive route is: \u201cAccording to the best moral theory I can discern, X is required; therefore I shall do X.\u201d The explanatory connection between her motive and the right act is robust: had morality required slightly less, she would have given slightly less; had it required a wholly different kind of sacrifice, she would have shifted accordingly. That systematic sensitivity underwrites the counterfactual reliability praiseworthiness demands.\n\n5.2 Attribution to the agent\u2019s values  \nIs Carla\u2019s motive attributable to her? Yes: it flows from her practical identity as someone who puts moral reasons first. Just as we praise the affectionate parent whose actions flow from love, we can praise the conscientious agent whose actions flow from principled respect. That the content of her desire is described abstractly does not undermine its depth or authenticity.\n\n5.3 Costs, effort, and strength  \nPraised acts often involve costs overcome. The de dicto desire can supply motivational force even when de re affection is absent, and so may require greater sacrifice. The soldier who rescues civilians because \u201cit\u2019s my moral duty\u201d despite fear and no personal connection seems eminently praiseworthy.\n\n6. Answering the fetishism and alienation worries\n\n6.1 Not affectively cold  \nA person whose central motive is \u201cto do what is right\u201d need not be emotionally barren. The higher-order commitment frequently co-exists with sympathetic concern. One can value morality abstractly and also value particular persons. Yet even if concrete emotions are lacking, principled action is not disfigured. Think of the shy donor who feels no warmth but will not walk past injustice.\n\n6.2 The right ordering of motives  \nCritics take the concrete goods to be explanatorily prior: one helps because others suffer. But the moral point may precisely be that agents acknowledge valid claims whatever their affections. Respect for persons sometimes requires bracketing personal likes. The fetish charge therefore presupposes a parochial partialist ethic\u2014they object that pure duty insufficiently mirrors their favourite first-order virtue. An impartial morality, however, vindicates the de dicto motive.\n\n6.3 No misrepresentation  \nDoes principled motivation mischaracterise morality? Only if morality\u2019s sole point is to promote welfare or friendship. That is contestable. Many moral theories (Kantian, contractualist, deontological pluralist) give autonomous recognition of right its own intrinsic value. Thus the critic\u2019s premise is theory-laden.\n\n7. Objections and replies\n\nObjection 1: De dicto agents must know what is right; but moral disagreement shows we rarely do.  \nReply: The motive is \u201cto do what is right as best I can discern,\u201d involving conscientious deliberation, openness to evidence, and willingness to revise belief. These epistemic virtues themselves attract praise.\n\nObjection 2: Praising duty-motivated action discourages the cultivation of proper sentiments.  \nReply: Nothing prevents a pluralist account: we can praise both kinds of motive. In domains like emergency medicine or public administration, de re empathy is unreliable; duty fills the gap. A society that valued only warm feelings would be dangerously sentimental.\n\nObjection 3: De dicto desire is second-personal; it regards morality as an external constraint, not as flowing from one\u2019s own projects, leading to self-alienation.  \nReply: Yet Kantian autonomy precisely integrates moral law with the will. The agent endorses the principle as her own. Far from alienating, it unifies.\n\n8. Comparisons with de re motivation\n\nAre there respects in which de re concern yields greater worth? Sometimes. An act motivated by both compassion and duty may display richer virtue. But sufficiency is weaker than optimality: the presence of one ground (duty) can be enough to merit praise even if another (empathy) would add further merit.\n\nA useful analogy is epistemic virtue. The mathematician who believes a theorem because she rigorously proved it is epistemically laudable. If she also happens to find the theorem beautiful, that adds aesthetic value but is not required for epistemic credit. Likewise, principled moral motivation secures the moral credit; supplementary sentiments add flourish, not fundament.\n\n9. Implications for moral education\n\nTaking the sufficiency of duty seriously affects pedagogy. We should teach children not only to feel for others but also to recognise that there are things one must do whether or not one feels like it. The capacity to adopt a de dicto moral stance is a developmental achievement, enabling adolescents to transcend peer pressure and in-group bias. Cultivating such a stance partly explains the social value of explicit moral rules.\n\n10. A hybrid picture\n\nWhile defending sufficiency, it is wise to acknowledge that human agents function best with a repertoire of motives. In daily life, de re sentiments often work faster and more vividly; de dicto commitment acts as a backstop and calibrator. The hybrid view honours the intuitions behind the fetish charge without conceding its exclusivity claim.\n\n11. Conclusion\n\nActing solely from a desire to do what is morally right can indeed suffice for moral worth. Such action:\n\n1. Manifests respect for the moral as such, itself a basic moral ideal.  \n2. Ensures reliable responsiveness to the full domain of moral reasons amidst our epistemic and affective limitations.  \n3. Expresses moral autonomy and principled self-government.  \n\nThese features satisfy the standard conditions for praiseworthy agency. The familiar charges of fetishism and alienation rest on contestable empirical claims about affect and on theoretical assumptions about what morality is \u201creally about.\u201d Once those are rejected, the motive of duty emerges not as a pale substitute for genuine concern but as a central pillar of moral excellence.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 4, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 2692, "reasoning_tokens": 384}
{"question_id": "ISSEROW-MORALWORTH-2020", "question": "Many philosophers have argued that the motive of duty\u2014understood as a de dicto desire to do what is morally right\u2014cannot suffice for moral worth. On their view, praiseworthy agents must be motivated by the concrete considerations that explain why their actions are right (such as concern for others' welfare), rather than by an abstract concern for morality as such. Critics charge that agents motivated solely by duty exhibit a kind of moral fetishism or alienation from what morality is really about. Can acting solely from a desire to do what is morally right suffice as a motive for morally worthy conduct? If so, what makes such dutiful action praiseworthy?", "answer": "Can the bare desire to do what is morally right\u2014the motive that Kant called acting \u201cfrom duty\u201d\u2014be enough to make an action morally worthy? Or must the morally admirable agent be moved instead (or additionally) by the concrete, first-order values that make the action right, such as another\u2019s need, the beauty of a natural environment, or the trust placed in her by a friend? This dispute, which runs from Hume through Kant to contemporary virtue ethics, pits two pictures of moral motivation against one another. One picture\u2014call it the Kantian picture\u2014holds that what the agent must fundamentally care about is rightness itself, treating the moral law as the decisive practical consideration. The other\u2014call it the particularist or value-acquaintance picture\u2014claims that genuine moral concern must be for the very goods, persons, and relationships that morality is \u201cabout.\u201d A person who frames her reasons at one remove, treating them as reasons because \u201cthat\u2019s what morality requires,\u201d is said to exhibit alienation (Stocker) or moral fetishism (Railton). \n\nI shall argue that acting solely from the de dicto desire to do what is right can indeed suffice for moral worth. The claim is not that all admirable actions arise this way, nor that motives of affection, sympathy, and friendship are morally inferior. Rather, the contention is that an agent whose entire motivational story is \u201cI did it because it was the right thing to do\u201d can be praiseworthy provided certain further conditions are met. Those conditions turn on how we understand the desire to do what is right. Properly construed, that desire is not an occult fixation with an abstract property; it is a second-order concern to regulate one\u2019s will by the balance of moral reasons, whatever they turn out to be. Such a concern embodies respect for persons, expresses the agent\u2019s autonomy, exhibits reliability across changing circumstances, and shows responsiveness to the full range of morally relevant considerations. Hence it captures many of the dimensions of virtue that critics allege it overlooks.\n\n1. Two Kinds of Desire for the Right\n\nWe must begin by distinguishing two attitudes that can both be described as a \u201cdesire to do what is right.\u201d\n\na) A merely de dicto desire: \u201cI want, of any action whatever, that it be morally right.\u201d This attitude may leave me completely ignorant of what makes an action right. I might be disposed to phone a hotline and comply with whichever directives the operator pronounces \u201cmorally obligatory,\u201d much as someone fetishises a designer label without grasping the qualities that make a garment good.\n\nb) A principled de dicto desire: \u201cI want, in acting, to respond correctly to the moral reasons that there are.\u201d This attitude is formal\u2014concerned with rightness in general\u2014but at the same time essentially reasons-responsive. In order to satisfy the desire, I must possess or seek the correct understanding of those first-order reasons and allow them to guide my choice. \n\nThe fetishism charge has bite against the first attitude. Yet it is the second attitude that Kantians have in mind when they speak of acting from duty. Kant\u2019s agent asks of every maxim whether it can be willed as universal law and lets the answer settle the practical question. That requires comprehending which features of her maxim matter morally\u2014for instance, whether it involves treating others as mere means. Hence the principled de dicto desire does not float above concrete values; it fixes the deliberative standpoint from which those values must be appreciated.\n\n2. Why Critics Doubt the Sufficiency of Duty Alone\n\nThree influential lines of criticism dominate the literature.\n\ni) The alienation objection (Stocker, Wolf): Morality is about people, their needs, and their projects. An agent who acts only \u201cbecause it is right\u201d is out of touch\u2014imagine visiting a sick friend solely from duty rather than friendship. The friend, it is said, will rightly feel estranged.\n\nii) The fetishism objection (Railton, Hursthouse): If one prizes actions for possessing a mysterious property of rightness, one\u2019s motivational pattern resembles the fetishist who loves an object because it is \u201cthe latest model,\u201d not because of its real qualities. This seems neurotic and aesthetically unattractive.\n\niii) The epistemic objection (Arpaly, Smith): To identify what is right, one must appreciate the very considerations that make it right. If one already appreciates those considerations, they will motivate directly; if they do not, the claim that one still \u201cdesires the right\u201d becomes suspect or empty.\n\nThe force of all three objections, I submit, depends on construing the duty motive as merely de dicto. Once we switch to the principled conception, the putative defects largely vanish.\n\n3. Respect as the Core of the Duty Motive\n\nKant introduced the idea of acting from duty to capture a fundamental form of respect for persons: one governs oneself by a law that one and all can share. Far from being an esoteric property, rightness just is what can be willed from the standpoint of each rational agent. When I regulate my conduct by that law, I thereby treat every other rational being as an equal co-legislator. \n\nThis motive is not indifferent to concrete goods; rather, it ensures that my concern for any concrete good is consistent with equal concern for all others. In contemporary parlance, it is a second-order, impartial concern. Such impartiality carries distinct moral value that cannot be reduced to sympathy or friendship. Someone who rescues a stranger at significant cost displays a form of moral commitment that sympathy alone rarely secures, for sympathy tracks felt closeness, not the claims of right.\n\n4. Understanding and Reliability\n\nSuppose Sophie leaps into the river to save a drowning child solely because it is morally obligatory. Does she understand why it is obligatory? If Sophie is acting from the principled duty motive, she must. The categorical imperative forbids treating a person\u2019s life as expendable; that is the concrete ground of obligation. Sophie\u2019s grasp of that ground need not assume the motivational role\u2014her desire for rightness is still the proximate cause\u2014but it informs her contentful representation of what counts as \u201cthe right thing.\u201d Absent that content, the de dicto desire would have nothing to latch onto.\n\nBecause the desire to do what is right is defined by a standing commitment to be guided by moral reasons, it provides a robustly reliable motive. Sympathy is often fickle; friendship partial; aesthetic appreciation selective. The duty motive, by contrast, extends to any case where the moral law applies. When circumstances change, the dutiful agent adapts. That reliability, Kant thought, is precisely what makes the good will \u201cgood without limitation.\u201d\n\n5. Alienation Reconsidered\n\nYet what of the sick-friend case? Imagine Mary visiting her hospitalized colleague. She feels no affection for him; their relations are cordial but not intimate. Still, she knows that calling on him is the right thing\u2014he is lonely, she can cheer him. Does her admission, \u201cI came because it was my duty,\u201d chill the encounter?\n\nWhether alienation arises depends on social context, not on the motive\u2019s moral worth. Mary might wisely say, \u201cI wanted to see how you\u2019re doing,\u201d thereby making manifest the concrete values (his welfare) that duty directed her to honor. Nothing in the duty motive prevents her from communicating those values; indeed, realizing them is her very aim. What would alienate is the agent who parades her moralism as a badge of superiority: \u201cI dislike you, but duty calls.\u201d That attitude is objectionable, not because duty motivates, but because the agent fails to integrate duty with a concern for the other\u2019s feelings\u2014in Kantian terms, she violates a duty of respect.\n\nNotice, then, that alienation criticisms conflate two questions: Which motives make an action worthy? and How should motives be expressed? Even if friendship is psychologically the warmer motive to display, it does not follow that acting solely from duty is less virtuous.\n\n6. Fetishism Dissolved\n\nThe fetishism objection asks: Why care about \u201crightness\u201d as such? The answer is that rightness is a practical role property\u2014being what one ought to do. Every deliberating agent necessarily cares about what she ought to do, on pain of practical irrationality. The duty motive thus generalizes a structural feature of agency: taking some consideration as decisive. When the relevant domain is morality, the decisive consideration is moral rightness. To call this a fetish is to mistake a constitutive feature of rational agency for a neurotic quirk.\n\nThe fetish comparison also misrepresents what provides motivational force. The label-lover chooses the hand-bag because of the label, indifferent to the bag\u2019s craftsmanship; the duty-lover chooses the action because of the moral law, but that law is itself determined by craftsmanship-like features: the action\u2019s effects on welfare, autonomy, trust, and so on. Hence the comparison inverts the explanatory order.\n\n7. The Epistemic Dimension\n\nAdverting to rightness is permissible only if the agent possesses adequate epistemic justification. Otherwise the desire is irrational or reckless. Yet this condition, far from undermining the sufficiency of duty, strengthens it: an agent who successfully acts from duty is guaranteed to have exercised moral understanding. When that understanding is hard-won\u2014say, the agent overcomes self-interest or group prejudice\u2014it is especially praiseworthy. Sympathy might prompt correct action even in the ignorant; duty cannot.\n\n8. Four Criteria of Moral Worth and How Duty Satisfies Them\n\nLet us now ask what makes an action morally worthy at all. Several theorists propose the following dimensions (adapted from Arpaly, Sobel, Skorupski):\n\n1) Responsiveness to moral reasons.\n2) Stability and reliability across contexts.\n3) Exercise of practical autonomy.\n4) Expressive fit with the moral facts (that is, the motive should match what is valuable about the outcome).\n\nWe can now see why the duty motive, suitably construed, satisfies each.\n\n1) Responsiveness: By definition, the agent takes moral rightness as decisive. She is therefore motivated exactly when and because the moral reasons obtain.\n\n2) Stability: Because the desire to do right is not tied to contingent affections or moods, it persists across different beneficiaries and circumstances.\n\n3) Autonomy: The agent acts on a self-endorsed principle rather than on inclinations given by nature or society.\n\n4) Expressive fit: Respecting rightness is a way of respecting the persons and values that constitute rightness. The motive therefore fits the value of those persons and goods, even if it does not take the same phenomenal form as affection.\n\n9. Case Studies\n\nConsider two cases to illustrate sufficiency.\n\nCase A: The Impartial Rescuer. Yolanda sees two drowning strangers, one of whom resembles her daughter. Sympathy pulls her toward the look-alike; duty tells her to aid whichever child she can reach in time. She calculates impartially and saves the child she can reach. Her only motive is that doing so is morally required. Intuitively, Yolanda is praiseworthy precisely because she subordinated partial feeling to duty. Her dutiful motive explains why we admire her.\n\nCase B: The Conscientious Judge. Omar must sentence a defendant who reminds him of his late father. Out of personal affection he wants to be lenient, but he recognizes that justice demands a harsher sentence. He sentences accordingly, moved solely by duty. Again, his conduct is admirable; if he had been moved by sympathy, it would have been corrupt. \n\nThese cases exhibit moral worth in circumstances where other motives would have been morally dangerous. That establishes that duty can be sufficient, even if not always necessary.\n\n10. Duty, Virtue, and the Integration Thesis\n\nA common reply is that the best moral character integrates motives: the virtuous person is moved both by direct concern for others and by duty. I agree; integration is ideal. But does that show that duty alone cannot suffice? No. A single virtue can be instantiated in varying degrees. The person who possesses only the core ingredient yet lacks the complementary sentiments still merits praise, though perhaps less than the fully integrated saint.\n\nMoreover, some roles\u2014judge, juror, public official\u2014must sometimes suppress partial affections. In them, the duty motive has pride of place. It would be perverse to demand warm fellow-feeling from a tax auditor or military commander in every decision. Moral worth here depends precisely on acting from duty in abstraction from first-order sympathies.\n\n11. A Worry about Moral Rigidity\n\nMight a purely dutiful agent become rigid, insensitive to context? Only if her conception of rightness is crude. The categorical imperative is not a mechanical rule but a test requiring sensitivity to particular facts. Likewise, contemporary consequentialists who desire to maximize the good\u2014another de dicto motive\u2014must learn a vast array of empirical details to act rightly. Their success depends on flexibility, not rigidity.\n\n12. Why the Duty Motive Is Especially Praiseworthy\n\nLet me now advance a positive thesis: acting solely from duty is not merely sufficient but often especially admirable because it manifests three virtues:\n\na) Self-control: One overcomes contrary inclination. That effort signals commitment.\n\nb) Impartial respect: One treats all persons as equals, resisting the pull of favoritism.\n\nc) Moral identity: One\u2019s practical identity is tied to the moral law. To use Korsgaard\u2019s phrase, one achieves unity of agency through autonomy.\n\nSympathy and friendship are morally valuable, but they do not guarantee these virtues. When they coincide with duty, their value is enhanced; when they conflict, duty\u2019s value comes to the fore.\n\n13. Remaining Limits\n\nI do not claim that duty suffices for maximal moral excellence. It suffices for moral worth in the sense of deserving praise for a particular act. A person who reliably acts from duty but never feels sympathy may still be flawed\u2014cold, perhaps. Virtue ethics rightly celebrates richer emotional attunement. Yet we can acknowledge that richer ideal while granting that the bare, principled desire to do right passes the threshold of worth. After all, moral appraisal is scalar.\n\n14. Conclusion\n\nCritics of the duty motive are right to warn against a stilted, label-loving form of moralism. But that caricature targets a truncated version of the motive. A more charitable and philosophically sophisticated account sees the desire to do what is right as a second-order commitment to live in accordance with moral reasons. Such a commitment demands understanding, grounds reliability, expresses respect, and secures autonomy. Actions issuing solely from that commitment therefore possess moral worth. They are worthy not in spite of but because of their formal orientation: by making rightness the decisive practical consideration, the agent situates herself within the moral community as a responsible co-legislator, demonstrating precisely the kind of self-respect and respect for others that morality is about.

Can acting solely from a desire to do what is morally right suffice as a motive for morally worthy conduct? If so, what makes such dutiful action praiseworthy?", "answer": "1. Introduction: the dispute over \u201cmoral fetishism\u201d  \n\nEver since Kant insisted that only actions \u201cfrom duty\u201d possess genuine moral worth, critics have worried that the purely dutiful agent is aiming at the wrong target. Bernard Williams\u2019s \u201cone thought too many,\u201d Michael Smith\u2019s \u201cfetishism\u201d objection, and Henson\u2019s charge of \u201cmoral alienation\u201d all develop the intuitive complaint that what matters, morally speaking, is what right-making considerations are about\u2014welfare, justice, promises kept\u2014not the abstract fact that an act is right. If I dive into the river to save a stranger because she will drown, my apparent virtue seems fuller-blooded than if I leap in merely because \u201cduty calls.\u201d According to the critics, an agent moved only by a de dicto desire to do whatever is right suffers from a kind of motivational misalignment: she does the right thing, but out of the wrong reasons, or at least impoverished ones.\n\nThe question therefore presses: can acting solely out of a desire to do what is morally right ever suffice for moral worth? I shall argue that it can. Properly understood, a de dicto desire to do what is right (i) can be suitably sensitive to the very considerations that make an action right, (ii) manifests a distinctive and important form of moral agency\u2014respect for the authority of morality\u2014which itself contributes to praiseworthiness, and (iii) escapes the charge of fetishism once we distinguish fetishistic concern with a property from reverential concern with a normatively authoritative status. To establish these claims, I first clarify the de dicto/de re distinction and the structure of the fetishism objection, then show why an exclusive de dicto motive need not be blind to concrete right-making facts, and finally explain what makes such dutiful action admirable in its own right.\n\n2. De dicto versus de re moral desires  \n\nIn contemporary semantics a de re desire is directed toward some particular feature or object under a specific description: I may want, de re, that this person\u2019s life go well, or that promises be kept. A de dicto desire, by contrast, has only the content expressed by the general proposition. Thus the de dicto moralist wants only that \u201cI do what is morally right,\u201d whatever rightness may consist in. Because the desire is \u201cthin,\u201d it can in principle be combined with any first-order moral outlook and therefore does not itself encode concern for, say, welfare or fairness.\n\nThe fetishism objection exploits precisely this thinness. Imagine two rescuers:\n\n(a) Care-Lydia sees a drowning child, is moved by empathetic concern for his suffering, and jumps in.  \n(b) Duty-Max sees the same child, reflects that saving the child is morally required, desires (de dicto) to do what duty demands, and jumps in.\n\nBoth act correctly; yet many share the intuition that Lydia\u2019s motive is morally worthier. If Max cares purely for \u201cthe right,\u201d does not this betray a kind of emotional or moral deficiency\u2014a failure to appreciate why saving a child matters?\n\n3. Why the fetishism objection overstates its case  \n\n3.1. Respect for rightness is not a mere fetish  \n\nA fetish, in the relevant sense, is an irrational attraction to an object\u2019s property that is not itself normatively significant. The worry is that \u201cright-as-such\u201d is being treated like a talisman: the agent fixates on it while neglecting what underlies its value. Yet rightness is not morally inert: it is the property of being what one ought to do, all things considered. To desire to do what one ought is precisely to be guided by practical reason\u2019s verdict. Respecting that verdict differs from fetishistically pursuing, say, coins because they are shiny. Coins\u2019 shininess is not reason-giving, but rightness is. The charge of fetishism therefore equivocates between a fascination with a normatively powerless property and acknowledgement of a property whose essence is to mark what there is decisive reason to do.\n\n3.2. De dicto concern can incorporate de re sensitivity  \n\nSecond, nothing in the psychology of Max the dutiful requires that he be insensitive to the concrete facts that make an action right. Indeed, to believe that saving the child is morally required, Max had to represent and assess those very facts: the child\u2019s life-threatening situation, the low cost to himself, the absence of morally overriding considerations. So long as he is rational, his general desire \u201cto do what morality requires\u201d operates through recognition of substantive moral considerations. The difference between Max and Lydia is not that Max fails to take account of the child\u2019s peril but that his final motivational endpoint is respect for the moral demand those considerations generate. The fetishism charge therefore mislocates the deficit: abstractness about one\u2019s ultimate motive does not entail blindness to first-order reasons in deliberation.\n\n3.3. The practical limits of empathy and partiality  \n\nMoreover, exclusive reliance on de re motives such as empathy, friendship, or special concern can be morally problematic. These motives often run out\u2014in cases of distant strangers, future people, or conflicts among loved ones. A de dicto commitment to rightness supplies both impartiality and stability where de re motives falter. Thus, even if Lydia\u2019s motive appears warmer in the single rescue scenario, a Max-type agent may prove more reliable across the wide moral landscape. Reliability in responsiveness to moral reasons is itself a dimension of virtue and a source of praiseworthiness.\n\n4. How a purely dutiful motive can bestow moral worth  \n\n4.1. Expressing responsiveness to moral reasons  \n\nNomy Arpaly and others have argued that moral worth tracks responsiveness to moral reasons: an act is praiseworthy when the agent acts because she recognizes the moral reasons that apply. A de dicto desire to do what is right precisely makes the agent responsive to the fact that p is what morally ought to be done. Provided the belief \u201cp is right\u201d is true and non-accidental (i.e., reached by sound moral cognition), the agent\u2019s conduct satisfies Arpaly\u2019s condition. What matters is the explanatory connection: the moral fact explains the action via the agent\u2019s recognition. That recognition can take the abstract form \u201cthis is right.\u201d Therefore, duty-based motivation can ground moral worth as effectively as\u2014or in some contexts more effectively than\u2014particularistic motives like sympathy.\n\n4.2. Manifesting respect for persons as ends in themselves  \n\nKant held that treating humanity as an end requires acting from duty rather than merely in conformity with duty. The dutiful agent does not treat others well simply because she happens to care for them; she does so out of recognition that they possess a moral standing that commands respect irrespective of personal inclination. Acting from the motive of duty therefore contains an egalitarian message: it affirms the equal authority of each person\u2019s claims upon us. This moral stance is praiseworthy in a distinctively Kantian sense; it displays a commitment to justice that is not hostage to contingent feelings.\n\n4.3. Upholding the authority of morality  \n\nWhen an agent acts solely from duty, she acknowledges morality as holding overriding normative authority. Such acknowledgment is constitutive of mature moral agency. To confer praise is, among other things, to evaluate agents for how they orient themselves to this authority. Even if Lydia\u2019s empathic motive is admirable, it remains psychologically possible for her to be swayed by partiality or fatigue. Max\u2019s de dicto motive underwrites a principled steadiness: he does the right thing because it is right, period. Praise is apt insofar as the act manifests this principled steadiness, something we value independently of warmth or emotional resonance.\n\n5. Objections and replies  \n\nObjection 1: The dutiful agent lacks the appropriate emotional engagement; moral worth demands integration of affect.  \nReply: We must distinguish moral worth from moral beauty. To be emotionally rich is aesthetically and interpersonally attractive, but moral appraisal primarily concerns the quality of an agent\u2019s will\u2014her responsiveness to moral reasons and respect for moral law. Duty suffices for that. Nothing prevents an ideal agent from combining de dicto and affective motives, but the presence of the latter is not necessary for praiseworthiness.\n\nObjection 2: A solely de dicto motive can be epistemically risky: the agent may misidentify what is right.  \nReply: Moral worth is conditional on the agent\u2019s belief tracking the truth in a non-accidental way. When Max is reliably sensitive to the reasons that in fact make acts right, the epistemic worry recedes. Fetishistic fixation would indeed be problematic if it led to scrupulosity or moral error, but that is a failure of moral epistemology, not of the de dicto motive itself.\n\nObjection 3: The praiseworthiness of dutiful acts is merely second-best; ideally we would integrate duty with de re concern.  \nReply: I grant that an integrated motivational set may exhibit a richer virtue. Yet \u201csecond-best\u201d does not mean un-praised. The question is whether duty alone can suffice, and sufficiency does not require optimality. A meal can be nourishing without being sumptuous; likewise, a dutiful action can be praiseworthy without being the most admirable conceivable.\n\n6. Comparative cases illuminating the issue  \n\nCase A: The principled vegetarian  \nClara refrains from eating meat solely because she believes it is morally wrong to cause unnecessary animal suffering. She feels no particular empathy for animals; indeed, she finds pigs unattractive. Nonetheless, her unwavering adherence to vegetarianism amidst social pressure manifests moral resolve. We rightly attribute moral worth to her abstention, precisely because it springs from her respect for what she takes to be a moral requirement.\n\nCase B: The fair-minded judge  \nJudge Lopez is unmoved by warm feelings toward the litigants before her. Her principal concern is to do what justice requires. She meticulously applies the law and moral principles because they are right, not because she sympathizes with either party. Rather than diminishing her praiseworthiness, this distance from personal sentiment underscores her commitment to the rule of law and the moral value of impartiality.\n\nCase C: Williams\u2019s husband  \nWilliams envisioned a husband who rescues his wife from drowning because she is his wife, not \u201cbecause it is the right thing.\u201d Suppose, however, that the husband rescued her precisely because it was morally required\u2014say, because he had a special obligation as her spouse. Far from being \u201cone thought too many,\u201d his explicit recognition of the moral dimension exemplifies respect for the normative weight of marital commitments. His motive is not chilly; it is principled.\n\nThese cases show that de dicto motivation can coexist with, and often enhances, morally relevant attitudes such as integrity, impartiality, and steadfastness.\n\n7. The structure of praiseworthiness  \n\nAn action earns praise when it issues from (i) a disposition that is stably responsive to genuine moral reasons, (ii) an agent who acts freely and knowingly, and (iii) a motivational orientation that acknowledges the authority of those reasons. A de dicto desire to do what is right satisfies all three so long as (a) the agent\u2019s moral beliefs are reliably formed and (b) the desire is motivationally efficacious. That is enough for moral worth. Empathy, affection, or compassion may add further dimensions of admirability, but they are not mandatory.\n\nBy analogy, consider intellectual virtue. A mathematician motivated by the desire \u201cto believe whatever is mathematically true\u201d is intellectually admirable even if she lacks a special fascination with, say, topology. Her respect for truth, generic though it is, manifests the proper epistemic orientation. Similarly, the agent who simply wants to do what is right exemplifies the proper practical orientation.\n\n8. Reconciling duty with richer moral psychology  \n\nAlthough I have defended the sufficiency of duty, nothing in my argument denies the value of integrating de dicto and de re motives. Indeed, mature virtue likely fuses them: compassion aligns with the recognition of others as ends, and love of justice dovetails with the resolve to do what is right. What matters is that the presence of other motives is a contingent enrichment, not a conceptual requirement for moral worth.\n\nThis conclusion harmonises with Kant\u2019s suggestion that acting from duty is necessary \u201cat least when\u201d inclination is absent or countervailing. If we add that acting from duty is sufficient when inclination is absent, then we see why purely dutiful acts deserve praise. They testify to the agent\u2019s capacity to let moral reasons govern her will even in emotional neutrality.\n\n9. Conclusion  \n\nActing solely from a desire to do what is morally right can indeed suffice for morally worthy conduct. The standard fetishism objection overlooks three central points: (1) rightness is itself a normatively potent property, so desiring to track it is not fetishistic; (2) a de dicto moral desire typically involves, and even requires, cognitive engagement with the first-order considerations that make an action right; (3) such a motive uniquely manifests respect for the authority of morality, impartiality, and principled steadiness\u2014features independently constitutive of praiseworthiness. Consequently, while we may celebrate the warmth of empathy and the richness of particular attachments, we should also recognise and commend the distinctive virtue of the dutiful agent whose guiding star is simply: do what is right.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 6, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 3337, "reasoning_tokens": 512}
{"question_id": "ISSEROW-MORALWORTH-2020", "question": "Many philosophers have argued that the motive of duty\u2014understood as a de dicto desire to do what is morally right\u2014cannot suffice for moral worth. On their view, praiseworthy agents must be motivated by the concrete considerations that explain why their actions are right (such as concern for others' welfare), rather than by an abstract concern for morality as such. Critics charge that agents motivated solely by duty exhibit a kind of moral fetishism or alienation from what morality is really about. Can acting solely from a desire to do what is morally right suffice as a motive for morally worthy conduct? If so, what makes such dutiful action praiseworthy?", "answer": "Can acting solely from a desire to do what is morally right be enough for moral worth? Philosophers of approximately Kantian sympathies have said \u201cyes,\u201d but a more recent chorus\u2014Bernard Williams, Michael Stocker, Susan Wolf, Samuel Scheffler, Jonathan Dancy, and others\u2014urges \u201cno.\u201d  They argue that an exclusive concern to \u201cdo the morally right thing\u201d is empty, fetishistic, or alienating unless it is grounded in the concrete values that make an act right: compassion for a friend, appreciation of beauty, reverence for truth, and so on.  In their view, an agent who rescues a drowning child merely \u201cbecause it\u2019s the right thing\u201d fails to manifest the sort of responsiveness that morality properly demands; the agent\u2019s focus on rightness-as-such is at best second-best and at worst pathological.  \n\nI defend the sufficiency claim.  Acting solely from the desire to do what is morally right can, under certain conditions, confer full moral worth.  The defense proceeds in five stages.\n\n1. Clarifying the target: what \u201cacting solely from duty\u201d really means.  \n2. Distinguishing three charges embedded in the fetishism critique.  \n3. Arguing that each charge misfires once we understand de dicto motivation more precisely.  \n4. Offering a positive account of why pure dutifulness is praiseworthy.  \n5. Explaining why mixed or \u201cproperly plural\u201d motives may often be better, without undermining the sufficiency thesis.\n\nThroughout, I use \u201cduty motive\u201d and \u201cde dicto motive\u201d interchangeably: a practical commitment whose content is simply that one perform whatever act is morally required, where the rightness of the act is characterised under the abstract description \u201cmorally right.\u201d\n\n1.  What is it to act solely from duty?\n\nNegative characterisation.  The dutiful agent\u2019s decision is not guided by empathy, personal affection, aesthetic relish, prudential gain, or any other concrete value.  Those factors may be present in the situation, but they are not what moves her; they are screened off, as it were, by her conscious discounting.  \n\nPositive characterisation.  The agent instead acts because (i) she judges that morality requires \u03c6-ing, and (ii) in the face of competing attractions \u03b8, she wills to \u03c6 simply on the ground that morality so requires.  She possesses a standing practical disposition of the following form:\n\n     (Duty)  If I judge that my \u03a6-ing is morally required, then (ceteris paribus) I will \u03a6.\n\nCrucially, this principle is self-consciously adopted and reflectively endorsed.  The Kantian calls it \u201creverence for the moral law.\u201d  One useful modern gloss (from Christine Korsgaard) is that the rightness-judgement functions as a rationally authoritative call: in recognising the requirement, the agent at the same time recognises herself as bound.  Her motive is thus a practical commitment to act on what she rationally recognises as required.\n\nNow, mere heedlessness or blind conformity should not be conflated with acting from duty.  The dutiful agent has deliberated; she has formed the judgement \u201c\u03c6-ing is morally right\u201d by consulting the relevant concrete considerations.  After all, how could she arrive at that all-things-considered verdict otherwise?  The claim that she acts solely from duty therefore means: once the judgement has been formed, the decisive motivational push derives from the content \u201cthis is right,\u201d not from any further attraction to the child\u2019s welfare, the beauty of saving a life, etc.\n\n2.  Three separate accusations of the fetishism camp\n\nA.  Epistemic shallowness: a de dicto motive is blind to what really makes the act right and therefore unreliable.  \n\nB.  Evaluative narrowness: even if the act turns out right, the motive fails to appreciate what has value; hence it expresses a deficient moral sensibility.  \n\nC.  Affective alienation: by bracketing concrete concern, the agent stands at an unhealthy emotional distance from persons and projects; life guided in that manner is cold or self-undermining.\n\nAlthough often run together, the charges are conceptually distinct.  The first is about knowledge, the second about value-appreciation, the third about psychological health.  I will argue that (A) misdescribes how de dicto motivation works; (B) confuses motivational sufficiency with reason-giving sufficiency; (C) confuses what is desirable in general with what is necessary for moral worth.\n\n3.  Reply to the three charges\n\nA.  Epistemic shallowness\n\nSomeone who wants only to do \u201cwhatever is morally required\u201d must still figure out what that is.  Accordingly, she has to attend to the very same concrete considerations that right-makers such as compassionists or utilitarians emphasise: the presence of suffering, the fairness of distributions, promises incurred, etc.  The de dicto desire therefore necessarily comes packaged with a second-order methodological commitment: \u201cFind out, as best you can, which concrete considerations make actions right.\u201d  It does not handicap the agent\u2019s epistemic access; rather, it harnesses it, because she will be reliably motivated to gather relevant moral information.  She might not be moved by each consideration directly, but she is motivationally open to their being right-makers.  The epistemic worry thus collapses.\n\nPerhaps the critic will now say that if the dutiful agent notices the drowning child only because she is scanning for \u201cmorally salient features,\u201d she is still defective: her salience-detection mechanism is functioning, but the sentimental content is missing.  That is precisely the evaluative narrowness worry.\n\nB.  Evaluative narrowness\n\nConsider two rescuers: Clara saves the child out of empathic concern, Daniel out of sheer reverence for moral rightness.  The fetishism complaint is that Daniel fails to value what matters\u2014the child\u2019s life\u2014for its own sake.  The complaint entails a substantive metaethical thesis: that moral worth hinges on loving the valuable for the reasons that make it valuable.  Why accept that thesis?\n\nA first answer appeals to Lockean or Aristotelian ideas about moral education: aiming at the right for its own sake is a fallback, whereas fully developed virtue involves loving the good.  Yet note that this tells us what an ideally virtuous person would find satisfying, not what minimum condition confers praiseworthiness on an act.  Even Aristotelians sometimes say that continence\u2014a person who obeys right reason while still at odds with her desires\u2014is morally worthy, albeit less attractive than full virtue.  If continence can be morally worthy, a fortiori dutiful action can be.\n\nA second answer weaponises the fitting-attitude model: if what makes Clara\u2019s action right is the child\u2019s welfare, then the fitting motive is concern for that welfare; anything else is unfitting.  This is too quick.  The concept of \u201cfitting motive\u201d bears two interpretations:\n\n   i.  fit as \u201caccurately representing the value,\u201d  \n   ii. fit as \u201cappropriately responding in practice to the value.\u201d\n\nThe Kantian can concede (i) but deny that (ii) requires the same psychological representation.  Responsiveness-to-value can be mediated through de dicto acknowledgement of its authority.  After all, in science we respond correctly to reality through formal inferential rules, not always through intuition of the phenomena.  Analogously, de dicto dutifulness responds to the worth of persons through the normative intermediary \u201cthey have a right,\u201d even if no warmth of feeling is present.\n\nC.  Affective alienation\n\nWolf\u2019s well-known \u201cMoral Saint\u201d argument portrays the life led wholly under the banner of moral rightness as bland, joyless, and ultimately alienating.  But the question before us is not whether such a life is desirable as a blueprint for flourishing; it is whether, in a given decision, being moved solely by rightness suffices for the moral worth of that decision.  Wolf\u2019s target is the comprehensive ideal; the sufficiency thesis is local.  Moreover, cases in which natural affection is absent (e.g., clinical depression blocking empathy) show that agents can be psychologically constrained while still admirably hanging on to the sole motive left available: \u201cthis is the morally right thing to do.\u201d  Far from being alienated, such agents display steadfast allegiance to the moral community despite their affective impediments.  That seems eminently praiseworthy.\n\n4.  The positive case for dutiful praiseworthiness\n\nFour considerations make purely dutiful action worthy of moral esteem.\n\n4.1  Respect for the moral law as an equalising stance\n\nKant\u2019s central insight is that practical reason demands that each person treat every other as a free and rational agent whose claims are of equal authority.  To act from the thought \u201cthis is morally required\u201d is to locate oneself within the space of such equality; it is the adoption of a standpoint from which no one\u2019s particular interests count for more just because they are nearer.  This respect-based motive has distinctive moral resonance: it acknowledges the generality and impartiality of moral reason.  Clara\u2019s empathy toward the drowning child is admirable, but empathy famously tracks similarity and proximity; respect, by contrast, is structurally universal.  When de dicto dutifulness overrides partiality, it exhibits a moral achievement: resisting personal preference in the name of a principle that applies to all.\n\n4.2  Reliability and diachronic stability\n\nConcrete fellow-feeling is contingent and fickle.  We are strongly moved by identifiable victims and by those within our circle, not by statistical lives or distant strangers.  A standing disposition to do whatever is right, precisely because it is impersonal, offers a form of reliability across contexts.  That reliability is morally valuable: think of a judge who, unimpressed by any defendant\u2019s charming personality, sentences only according to justice; or a guardian of public funds who cannot be bribed by friendship.  Such agents may exhibit no warmth, yet we rightly praise their incorruptibility.\n\n4.3  Expression of self-governance\n\nPraiseworthiness implicates not just what we do but how we do it.  An act prompted by emotion can fail to manifest the agent\u2019s capacity for autonomous practical reasoning; it might be more like a reflex than a choice.  Acting from the explicit recognition of moral rightness, by contrast, makes clear that the agent has guided herself through rational deliberation.  This full, reflective ownership of action is a locus of moral worth.  Indeed, even when emotional motives concur with duty, an additional reflective endorsement is normally expected.  In gratitude we do not merely feel; we decide that repayment is owed.  De dicto dutifulness foregrounds that decisional moment.\n\n4.4  Solidarity with the moral community\n\nPerforming an act because \u201cit\u2019s the right thing\u201d signals one\u2019s willingness to answer publicly for it under the shared currency of moral reasons.  That signalling matters: it reassures others that they can rely on one, and it reinforces the social practice of giving and asking for moral reasons.  A private sentimental motive lacks this communicative quality.  Hence dutiful action plays an indispensable role in sustaining the very institution of morality.\n\nThese four points show that acting solely from duty is not a moral consolation prize; it realises distinctive values\u2014equality, reliability, autonomy, and solidarity\u2014sufficient for praise.\n\n5.  Reconciling the sufficiency thesis with the attractions of richer motives\n\nEverything said so far is compatible with the thought that, other things equal, moral agents should cultivate the concrete sentiments that track value more directly.  An Aristotelian might say: pure dutifulness is virtuous continence, but virtue proper adds right-aligned desire.  I can happily grant that continence-plus-desire is better than continence alone.  What matters is that continence alone clears the bar for praiseworthiness.\n\nThe sufficiency thesis also allows room for hybrid motivational structures.  One might be moved in the first instance by sympathy, yet underwrite sympathy\u2019s authority by recognising that sympathy itself is morally required.  Conversely, one might be led by duty in hard cases, while allowing congenial sentiments to do most of the day-to-day motivational work.  Such ecumenism does not threaten but rather illustrates the central claim: pure de dicto motivation suffices, even if it is sometimes complemented by more particular sentiments.\n\n6.  Possible objections and replies\n\nObjection 1:  The content of \u201cmorally right\u201d is too indeterminate; thus a de dicto motive is vacuous.\n\nReply:  The content is indeterminate only prior to deliberation.  Once the agent has judged that \u03a6 is required by morality, she possesses a determinate content: \u03a6.  She might be mistaken, but that vulnerability afflicts any motivation.  Moreover, the de dicto stance includes the procedural norm \u201ctest my judgement against critical reflection and evidence,\u201d which guards against vacuity.\n\nObjection 2:  An agent who lacks spontaneous concern reveals a flaw of character; how can flawed character produce praiseworthy acts?\n\nReply:  Moral worth attaches primarily to acts as expressions of will, not to global character evaluations.  One can be praiseworthy in a specific choice even while falling short of full virtue overall.  Besides, the charge assumes that lack of sentiment is always a defect\u2014sometimes it is a psychological limitation not of the agent\u2019s choosing.\n\nObjection 3:  Pure dutifulness invites moral fanaticism: if an agent\u2019s rightness-judgement is mistaken, she will doggedly pursue wrong ends.\n\nReply:  The same holds for any strongly motivating internal value.  Fanaticism is not peculiar to the duty motive but to the absence of critical reflection.  A properly Kantian outlook contains the meta-norm of revisability: \u201cAct only on maxims you can will as universal laws.\u201d  That meta-norm internalises critical reason and thus guards against fanaticism.\n\n7.  Closing illustration\n\nImagine two doctors in a triage unit during a pandemic.  Doctor A is hounded by exhaustion; her compassion circuits are nearly burnt out after weeks on shift.  All that keeps her sorting patients in line with the impartial protocol is the thought: \u201cThis is the morally right procedure; deviating would wrong my patients.\u201d  Doctor B, still emotionally buoyant, is moved by her vivid sense of each person\u2019s suffering.\n\nBoth save the same lives.  To praise only Doctor B seems perverse.  Doctor A\u2019s steadfast adherence to duty under emotional depletion is, if anything, more admirable.  Her motive is exclusively de dicto.  Yet the act has full moral worth, illustrating the sufficiency of the duty motive.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe thesis that pure dutifulness suffices for moral worth survives scrutiny.  The fetishism critique conflates epistemic access, value-appreciation, and psychological well-being.  Once disentangled, none undermines the moral credentials of the de dicto motive.  On the positive side, acting from the desire to do what is right distinctively manifests respect for persons as equals, reliability across contexts, self-governance, and solidarity with the moral community.  Such features are fully capable of making an act praiseworthy even when no other motive is present.\n\nThis conclusion does not dethrone the moral significance of concrete sentiments.  Sympathy, friendship, and love remain central to a flourishing human life.  The claim is more modest: when concrete sentiments flag or are overruled, a bare but firm allegiance to moral rightness can carry the day\u2014and when it does, the deed is not merely permissible but worthy of praise.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 7, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 3633, "reasoning_tokens": 320}

Many philosophers\u2014most famously Kant\u2019s sympathetic interpreters, but also their critics\u2014answer \u201cno.\u201d The dominant worry is that someone moved only by a de dicto desire to do whatever morality requires is insufficiently related to the very features that make her action right. As Julia Annas quips, \u201c[I]f all you really want is to keep your moral nose clean, you have missed what morality is about.\u201d This worry, variously labeled \u201cmoral fetishism\u201d (Smith), \u201calienation\u201d (Stocker), or \u201cmoral schizophrenia\u201d (Williams), has led several contemporary theorists to abandon the Kantian idea that motive of duty alone can ground moral worth.\n\nI shall defend a qualified yes: an agent\u2019s action can be morally praiseworthy if her sole proximate motive is the abstract desire to do what is right. The defense has three steps:\n\n1. Clarify what a de dicto desire to do the right thing amounts to.  \n2. Show that such a desire, properly understood, can incorporate sensitivity to the concrete right\u2010making considerations that critics think are required.  \n3. Explain how this sensitivity, together with certain epistemic and volitional virtues, yields moral worth without reducing to the \u201cfetishized\u201d footing critics fear.\n\nAlong the way I address three major objections: (i) the fetishism objection (Smith/Herman), (ii) the alienation objection (Stocker), and (iii) the motivational necessity of particularistic concern (Railton, Arpaly). My conclusion is that a pure motive of duty can be morally worthy because it can function as a second\u2010order regulative commitment that coordinates the agent\u2019s first\u2010order practical reasoning in a way that manifests respect for the moral law. When it plays that role, the motive is no mere fetish but a rational disposition that integrates the agent\u2019s will with the very values that ground morality.\n\nI. What is it to act \u201csolely from a desire to do what is morally right\u201d?\n\n\u201cDesire\u201d and \u201csolely\u201d need careful handling. A simplistic reading is that the agent\u2019s only motivating state is the propositional attitude: \u201cI desire that I \u03c6 iff \u03c6 is morally obligatory.\u201d All concrete facts\u2014e.g., that \u03c6 relieves Sophie\u2019s anxiety\u2014are motivationally inert; they move the agent only via the detour \u201crelieving anxiety is morally required.\u201d That kind of agent seems pathological\u2014robotic, affectless, and epistemically precarious. But two clarifications blunt this initial worry.\n\nFirst, the \u201csole\u201d motive can be understood as the agent\u2019s highest\u2010order decisive motive rather than the only psychological state in play. A Kantian agent may feel empathy, enjoy others\u2019 happiness, or shudder at suffering; yet when she acts, she does so because she judges the action right, not because she enjoys or dislikes certain outcomes. Empathy and sympathy can be present as inclinations, but they are not granted final normative authority. This diluted \u201csole\u201d is common in Kant\u2019s Grundlegung: to act from duty is to act \u201cfor the sake of the law,\u201d even if one also happens to take pleasure in performing the act.\n\nSecond, the de dicto description need not be content\u2010blind. Christine Korsgaard emphasizes that an agent can adopt the moral law as her practical identity. If so, the law\u2019s general prescriptions are not empty placeholders; they implicitly encode the agent\u2019s substantive grasp of concrete values. Likewise, Mark Schroeder argues that a de dicto desire derives motivational force from the agent\u2019s background understanding of what morality requires. In effect, the de dicto/de re distinction collapses at the level of practical reasoning: to desire to do what is right just is to desire to realize whatever antecedently strikes one as the morally relevant features of the situation. Thus, an agent with only the abstract desire can still deliberate about the particulars. The abstraction need not entail motivational blindness.\n\nII. How a pure desire to do what is right incorporates concrete right\u2010makers\n\nCritics object that de dicto motivation lacks \u201cdirection\u2010of\u2010fit\u201d to the world\u2019s value. But consider a structurally similar case outside morality. A theoretical reasoner has a de dicto desire to \u201cbelieve what is true.\u201d She forms specific beliefs by aiming at truth, deploying epistemic virtues, and correcting errors. We do not criticize her for lacking a particularistic desire to believe that p, q, and r; her higher\u2010order epistemic motive is precisely what rationally guides her toward each specific truth. So too in practical reasoning. A standing desire to do what is right equips one to appreciate, track, and respond to concrete moral reasons, just as a standing desire to believe what is true equips one to track evidence.\n\nThis analogy highlights three capacities that mediate between the abstract motive and concrete right\u2010makers:\n\n1. Epistemic Sensitivity. The agent must competently identify what morality requires in her circumstances. If her rightness judgments are systematically off, her de dicto motive is defective.  \n2. Instrumental Reliability. She must reliably translate her moral judgments into effective action. Otherwise the motive is motivationally inert.  \n3. Counterfactual Robustness. Across a range of situations, changes in right\u2010making features should lead to corresponding changes in judgment and action. This is Fischer and Ravizza\u2019s \u201creason\u2010responsive\u201d profile, applied to moral motives.\n\nThese capacities supply the missing link: an agent who cares only about \u201cdoing what is right\u201d but systematically fails to grasp or act on concrete right\u2010makers is not praiseworthy. When, however, the capacities are in place, nothing further is needed. Concern for Sophie\u2019s welfare manifests itself not as a separate desire but as part of what the agent\u2019s moral theory recognizes as rightness\u2010conferring. The motive of duty functions as a regulative ideal that keeps the agent\u2019s deliberation attuned to the moral landscape.\n\nIII. Why the pure motive can generate moral worth\n\nGranting that a de dicto desire can in principle incorporate sensitivity, does it generate a distinctive kind of moral worth\u2014one that competes with or even surpasses more concrete motives like sympathy? The Kantian tradition says yes; indeed, it claims that only duty yields full moral worth. I will not press that bold thesis. I argue the modest claim that the pure motive suffices for praiseworthiness because it expresses two agent\u2010centered excellences:\n\nA. Respect for Persons as Rational Agents  \nTo act solely from duty is to treat others (and oneself) as ends and never merely as means, because the moral law\u2019s content is determined by principles that all rational agents can will. The agent\u2019s de dicto motive thus demonstrates an attitude of respect not reducible to sympathy or benevolence. She does not act for the sake of gratifying her fellow\u2010feeling or her favorite values; she acts out of deference to a shared norm of freedom. This attitude is intrinsically valuable and plausibly warrants praise.\n\nB. Integrity of Practical Identity  \nHarry Frankfurt notes that what we care about reflectively constitutes who we are. A general commitment to morality integrates the agent\u2019s will around a stable core, enabling her to resist temptation, coordinate projects, and answer the question \u201cWho am I?\u201d with \u201cSomeone who does the right thing.\u201d That integration is an excellence in agency, akin to aristocratic courage or Aristotelian prudence. Agents who display it are apt objects of admiration.\n\nWhile the benevolent agent who rescues Sophie because he loves her scores high on benevolence, he may lack the robust commitment displayed by an agent who would rescue any stranger because it\u2019s right. Praiseworthiness thus tracks the breadth and steadiness of one\u2019s dispositions as well as their sentimental warmth.\n\nIV. Replies to the main objections\n\n1. The Fetishism Objection (Michael Smith; Barbara Herman)  \nSmith claims that a \u201cmoral fetishist\u201d is like someone who keeps her partner\u2019s letters in a locket\u2014valuing the wrong thing. But the analogy misfires. The fetishist values the locket as an object detached from its significance; the moral agent values the right action precisely because of its moral significance. Herman worries that abstract motivation shows indifference to the victim\u2019s plight. Yet Kantian duty can incorporate empathetic understanding instrumentally: concern for Sophie\u2019s distress is the reason the action counts as a duty. If I save her only because the law says so, and the law says so because of her distress, I thereby save her because of her distress. No fetish ensues.\n\n2. The Alienation Objection (Michael Stocker)  \nStocker imagines a hospital visitor who declares, \u201cI\u2019m here because it\u2019s my duty, not because I care about you.\u201d Such explicit avowals alienate friends. But the Kantian agent need not avow her motive, nor need she lack care. She may visit partly from sympathy, yet regard duty as the authoritative ground. Even if she did act from bare duty, her friend\u2019s preference for a sympathy\u2010based visit is an interpersonal, not a moral, evaluation. Moral worth and likability come apart; cooking a tasty meal from duty can still be praiseworthy, though perhaps chillier.\n\n3. The Particularist Concern Objection (Peter Railton, Nomy Arpaly)  \nRailton\u2019s \u201csophisticated consequentialist\u201d loves his friends as such; if he loved them only as loci of utility he\u2019d be defective. Arpaly argues that moral worth attaches to action responsive to the morally salient features \u201cfor the right reasons.\u201d But again, a de dicto desire can guide responsiveness. What matters is that the action is non\u2010deviantly caused by the right reasons; whether those reasons are encoded in a de dicto representation (\u201cdo what\u2019s right\u201d) or a de re representation (\u201chelp Sophie\u201d) is irrelevant if the causal path passes through accurate moral cognition.\n\nV. A Positive Model: Duty as Second\u2010Order Governance\n\nTo consolidate the defense, consider a hierarchical model of the will:\n\nLevel 0: Sensory/sentimental impulses (fear, sympathy, anger)  \nLevel 1: First\u2010order practical judgments about what to do in particular situations  \nLevel 2: Second\u2010order commitments that govern how Level 1 judgments are formed\n\nA pure motive of duty operates primarily at Level 2. It is a standing policy: \u201cForm and endorse Level\u20101 judgments that best accord with the moral law.\u201d This policy evaluates candidate reasons, sets priorities, and triggers self\u2010scrutiny when inconsistency looms. On this model:\n\n\u2022 The motive is substantive. Its content is the moral law\u2019s content.  \n\u2022 It is motivational. It directs the formation and execution of Level\u20101 judgments.  \n\u2022 It is praiseworthy. It manifests volitional virtue\u2014steadfastness, impartiality, and responsiveness.\n\nBecause Kantian duty resides at Level 2, its praiseworthiness does not hinge on the presence or absence of Level\u20100 sentiments. It is compatible with, but not dependent on, benevolence. And by shaping Level\u20101 deliberation, it ensures the agent\u2019s decisions track the concrete right\u2010making facts. The \u201calienation\u201d fear dissipates: Sophie\u2019s welfare matters because the Level\u20101 judgment \u201cHelp Sophie\u201d flows from the Level\u20102 policy\u2019s application to the concrete fact of Sophie\u2019s distress.\n\nVI. Limits and Qualifications\n\nAlthough I have argued that a sole motive of duty can suffice, I grant two caveats:\n\n1. Epistemic Fallibility. A moderately informed but error\u2010prone agent may be less praiseworthy than a sentimental agent whose feelings reliably track rightness. A false moral belief, no matter how conscientious, can undermine worth. So duty\u2019s sufficiency is conditional on reasonable epistemic competence.\n\n2. Virtue as an Ideal. Aristotelian virtue integrates cognition, emotion, and action seamlessly. Pure duty may secure right action but fail to perfect character. Moral worth, on some rich virtue\u2010ethical conceptions, demands a harmonious soul. My claim is only about praiseworthiness in the narrower deontic sense, not about full human flourishing.\n\nVII. Conclusion\n\nA purely dutiful action\u2014one motivated decisively by the desire to do what is morally right\u2014can indeed be morally praiseworthy. The key is to understand the motive, not as a content\u2010less fetish, but as a second\u2010order regulative commitment that incorporates epistemic sensitivity to concrete right\u2010makers and expresses respect for persons and integrity of will. When these conditions obtain, the abstract desire suffices, and the familiar objections lose their sting. Caring about the rightness of one\u2019s actions is not a distraction from morality; it is a sophisticated mode of being moral. Morality is, after all, about doing what is right\u2014sometimes for no other reason than that it is right.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 8, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 2856, "reasoning_tokens": 192}
{"question_id": "ISSEROW-MORALWORTH-2020", "question": "Many philosophers have argued that the motive of duty\u2014understood as a de dicto desire to do what is morally right\u2014cannot suffice for moral worth. On their view, praiseworthy agents must be motivated by the concrete considerations that explain why their actions are right (such as concern for others' welfare), rather than by an abstract concern for morality as such. Critics charge that agents motivated solely by duty exhibit a kind of moral fetishism or alienation from what morality is really about. Can acting solely from a desire to do what is morally right suffice as a motive for morally worthy conduct? If so, what makes such dutiful action praiseworthy?", "answer": "1. Introduction: What Is at Issue?\n\nOne of the oldest disagreements in moral psychology concerns the source of a good deed\u2019s \u201cmoral worth.\u201d Kantians traditionally insist that the best deeds are done \u201cfrom duty,\u201d whereas many contemporary virtue-ethicists, sentimentalists and even some Kantians worry that the pure motive of duty leaves an agent \u201cmorally alienated\u201d from the concrete values that make the action right. The abstract desire to \u201cdo what morality requires\u201d (a de dicto desire) allegedly reveals an objectionable moral fetishism: the agent loves morality in the way a stamp-collector loves stamps, rather than loving the people, goods and relationships morality is about.  \n\nIs the worry well-founded? I shall argue that, yes, acting solely from duty can suffice for moral worth, provided we understand both (i) what the de dicto desire really amounts to in a self-conscious, rational agent and (ii) what kind of credit moral worth involves. I defend a broadly Kantian answer enriched by contemporary work by Nomy Arpaly, Sarah Buss and Sarah McGrath: the praiseworthiness of dutiful action lies in the quality of will the agent manifests\u2014namely, a steadfast practical commitment to the authority of moral reasons\u2014and not primarily in the phenomenology of warm fellow-feeling. Far from being fetishistic, such a motive embodies epistemic humility, impartial respect and responsible agency.  \n\nThe discussion proceeds as follows. Section 2 clarifies the de dicto / de re distinction. Section 3 presents three standard objections to the sufficiency of the duty motive (fetishism, motivational inadequacy and alienation). Section 4 answers these objections. Section 5 develops a positive account of why pure duty motivation merits praise. Section 6 responds to remaining concerns and draws three upshots for moral education.\n\n2. De Dicto Versus De Re Motivation\n\nFollowing Mark Schroeder, a de dicto desire has the propositional content \u201cthat I do what is morally right,\u201d whereas a de re desire is directed at a particular right-making feature\u2014for example, the other person\u2019s welfare, fairness, promise-keeping, etc. In ordinary life the two frequently overlap: my concern for fairness (de re) may be part of my more general concern to \u201cdo the right thing\u201d (de dicto). The philosophical question is whether an agent whose psychology contained only the de dicto element could still act with full moral worth.\n\nNotice two background assumptions:\n\nA1. Moral worth tracks the quality of will revealed in the action.  \nA2. An agent can possess a de dicto desire in either a superficial or a deeply reflective way.  \n\nA superficial de dicto desire might be: \u201cI want to keep my moral record clean because I care about my moral reputation.\u201d That clearly earns no special credit. The question before us concerns reflective, unconditional avowal of morality\u2019s authority\u2014the Kantian motive.\n\n3. Three Objections to the Sufficiency of Duty\n\nObjection 1. Fetishism (Smith, Slote, Dancy). To prize \u201cright-ness as such\u201d is like prizing \u201cgoldenness as such.\u201d It misconceives morality\u2019s point, which is to protect and promote concrete goods.\n\nObjection 2. Motivational Inadequacy (Williams). A bare wish to do right is too indeterminate to guide conduct. One must consult the reasons that make an act right; hence motivation by those reasons is necessary.\n\nObjection 3. Alienation (Stocker). Someone who visits her sick friend only because \u201cit is the right thing to do\u201d slighted the friend\u2019s personhood; the friend will feel not cared for but used as an occasion for moral self-congratulation.\n\n4. Answers to the Objections\n\n4.1 The De Dicto Desire Need Not Exclude De Re Appreciation\n\nSuppose I rescue a drowning child on the sole ground that \u201cthis is morally required.\u201d Does that psychological state rule out my seeing why it is required\u2014namely that a child\u2019s life is in danger? No. The content of my desire is general, but its practical implementation obviously engages my recognition of the concrete fact. Critics often conflate \u201cexclusive\u201d and \u201csufficient.\u201d To say a motive is sufficient for moral worth is not to say it precludes other motives or that the agent is blind to right-making reasons. A high-level commitment can integrate lower-level concerns analogously to how \u201cwinning the game\u201d guides a basketball player: he still focuses on dribbling, passing and shooting, though these subordinate ends have value only within the higher-level practical identity of an athlete. Similarly, the duty-bound agent recognizes the child\u2019s welfare as a morally relevant consideration within her overarching commitment to right action.\n\n4.2 Epistemic Humility and Guidance\n\nContra Williams, a de dicto commitment can supply definite guidance by functioning as a standing decision-procedure: \u201cAct on whichever reasons turn out objectively to be morally decisive.\u201d In situations of uncertainty or conflicting intuitions, the de dicto desire motivates an agent to inquire, deliberate and seek advice, precisely because she wants to get morality right. Thus its apparent indeterminacy is another form of responsiveness, not impotence. Indeed, many historical moral advances\u2014abolitionism, women\u2019s suffrage\u2014were led by individuals who trusted the authority of morality in abstraction from the particular social norms of their day. Their de dicto motive pushed them to ask, \u201cAre we really treating people as morality requires?\u201d without yet possessing a fully articulated de re picture.\n\n4.3 The Social Phenomenology of Respect\n\nStocker imagines the sick friend rebuking the dutiful visitor: \u201cYou only came because it was right!\u201d But contrast two ways of acting from duty:\n\ni. Hypocritical duty: the agent is reluctantly dragged by an external ought.  \nii. Wholehearted duty: the agent identifies with the moral demand and therefore with the friend\u2019s legitimate claim.  \n\nIn case (ii) the visitor\u2019s quality of will is not cold or alienating; it is precisely respect. Immanuel Kant describes such respect as \u201ca feeling produced by reason\u201d that acknowledges the other\u2019s status as an end in herself. Modern empirical work on testimonial injustice confirms that being treated with principled respect\u2014having one\u2019s rights and dignity acknowledged\u2014often matters as much as warmth.\n\n5. A Positive Account: Why Pure Duty Merits Praise\n\n5.1 Control and Credit\n\nTo be praiseworthy an action must manifest something under the agent\u2019s rational control. De re affections\u2014likes, sympathies, particular attachments\u2014are partly contingent givens of temperament and circumstance. By contrast, the reflective commitment to treat moral requirements as decisive is an achievement of practical reason. Thus duty qualifies the agent for praise in a deeper sense: it shows who she has made herself to be.\n\n5.2 Impartiality and Fairness\n\nA central moral ideal is impartial concern. De re motives risk distortions: I may feel more sympathy for the nearby child than for the distant refugee, or for the pretty victim than the plain one. The de dicto desire, by tying my will directly to the normative property of right-ness, corrects these biases. The agent who acts because \u201cit is what morality demands\u201d treats like cases alike, and that is a virtue.\n\n5.3 Stability and Reliability\n\nCompassion waxes and wanes; friendship can sour. But the agent guided by duty is predictably moral across contexts. Sarah McGrath argues that the disposition to respond correctly to moral reasons, whatever they are, is a higher-order reliability trait and accordingly more creditable.\n\n5.4 Autonomy and Self-Legislation\n\nKant famously holds that humanity\u2019s distinctive dignity lies in self-legislation: accepting the moral law because one has rationally recognized it as binding. This autonomous stance is invisible to an observer looking only at affectionate feelings, yet it is the very feature that expresses our status as free moral agents rather than mere conduits of sentimental energy. Those who manifest it deserve esteem.\n\n6. Replies to Remaining Worries\n\n6.1 Isn\u2019t Caring Morally Required?\n\nOne might object that morality itself requires us to cultivate direct concern for others, so the de dicto agent falls short of her own ideal. Two replies: (a) The question is sufficiency, not ideality; an action can be fully worthy even if alternative motives might have been better still. (b) The second-personal structure of duty actually embodies a form of caring: valuing others under the description \u201cbearers of moral claims\u201d is a distinctive mode of concern.\n\n6.2 Moral Schizophrenia?\n\nJ. B. Schneewind warns that splitting motive from value risks incoherence: how can one desire to do A because it is right without also desiring the features that make A right? The answer invokes hierarchical integration. Just as the scientist values truth and therefore seeks empirical evidence, the moral agent values rightness and therefore is responsive to welfare, fairness, etc. The subordinate motives are derived rather than independent, but they are nonetheless affectively alive within deliberation.\n\n6.3 Supererogatory Acts\n\nConsider a bystander who risks her life to save strangers \u201cbecause it is the right thing.\u201d Is she less heroic than one who feels overwhelming sympathy? Plausibly she is more heroic, precisely because she overcomes natural self-interest not through accident of emotion but through principled choice. The concept of duty thus explains, better than any sentimentalist account, why such deeds inspire admiration.\n\n7. Practical Implications\n\nFirst, moral education should cultivate the habit of reflecting, \u201cWhat morally ought I to do?\u201d rather than relying exclusively on spontaneous empathy. Second, public institutions can reinforce citizens\u2019 respect for moral norms by making procedures transparent and reason-giving, thereby supporting the de dicto motive. Third, juridical blame should focus on whether agents demonstrated disregard for morality\u2019s authority, not on whether they lacked warm feelings.\n\n8. Conclusion\n\nActing solely from the desire to do what is morally right can indeed suffice for moral worth. The abstract, de dicto orientation is neither fetishistic nor alienating when properly understood. It expresses autonomous willing, impartiality, reliability and a distinctive form of respect for persons. Such qualities warrant praise not because they devalue concrete goods, but because they secure those goods under conditions where sentiment and partiality are unreliable. The moral law is no mere stamp collection; it is the form of freedom itself, and those who act from duty manifest that freedom in its most admirable guise.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 9, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 2560, "reasoning_tokens": 320}

Can acting solely from a desire to do what is morally right suffice as a motive for morally worthy conduct? If so, what makes such dutiful action praiseworthy?", "answer": "Can the bare desire to \u201cdo the right thing\u201d ground morally worthy action, or must praiseworthy agents be moved by the concrete values that make an act right\u2014love, concern, respect, benevolence, solidarity?  Over the past half-century, a chorus of critics\u2014Bernard Williams (\u201cone thought too many\u201d), Michael Stocker (\u201cmoral schizophrenia\u201d), Susan Wolf (\u201cmoral saints\u201d), Nomy Arpaly, Jonathan Dancy and many others\u2014have answered \u201cno.\u201d  Their guiding thought is that the motive of duty, understood de dicto as a generic desire to perform \u201cwhatever morality requires,\u201d is too thin, too abstract, to connect an agent to the real point of morals.  Acting from duty alone allegedly reveals a fetish for moral rightness, a kind of aestheticised regard for purity of will that crowds out the humane sentiments that morality is about.  \n\nYet this verdict is not forced on us.  In what follows I argue that (1) de dicto moral motive can in principle suffice for moral worth; (2) when it does, its worth stems from the distinctively human achievement of recognizing and governing oneself by authoritative normative reasons; and (3) the standard objections\u2014alienation, motivational thinness, and \u201cone thought too many\u201d\u2014rest on an unduly impoverished picture of what the motive of duty can be and of the variety of ways in which agents may relate to right-making considerations.\n\nI. Clarifying the target: de dicto and de re motives  \n\nCall a motive de re when it is directed at the very features that make an action right: I pull you from the river because I want to save your life, not because I have the thin thought \u201csaving lives is the right thing to do.\u201d  A de dicto motive, by contrast, takes the form \u201cI want to do whatever morality requires, whatever that turns out to be; and this (it turns out) is what morality requires.\u201d  Two warnings are in order.  First, the de dicto motive need not be contentless: typically an agent forms a concrete judgment\u2014\u201chelping her now is my duty\u201d\u2014and is moved by that.  Second, de dicto and de re motives can of course coexist.  The critic\u2019s claim is that the de dicto motive, on its own, is never enough for moral worth.  My question is whether that is true.\n\nII. Two conceptions of moral worth  \n\nOne conception\u2014call it the \u201crich content\u201d view\u2014holds that an act has moral worth only if the agent\u2019s motive appropriately mirrors the right-making considerations.  Kant sometimes sounds like a proponent: the worth of an action, he says, lies in its being done \u201cfrom duty\u201d rather than from any \u201cinclination.\u201d  Yet influential neo-Aristotelians read him, plausibly or not, as insisting that the motive be the correct moral principle, not the agent\u2019s generic respect for morality.  In either case, matching motives to moral truths is the key.  \n\nThe rival conception\u2014call it the \u201cnormative control\u201d view\u2014locates moral worth instead in the agent\u2019s reliable governance by reasons she takes to be authoritative.  What matters is that she respond to the right reasons because they are right, even if the psychological route by which she responds abstracts from their concrete features.  On this view a de dicto motive can suffice, so long as it functions as a modality of rational self-government.\n\nIII. An analogy with theoretical reason  \n\nImagine a mathematician who sets out to prove whatever follows from the axioms.  Faced with a conjecture, she does not form a burning desire for that particular theorem; her animating aim is \u201cto believe what the axioms entail.\u201d  Nobody accuses her of \u201cepistemic fetishism.\u201d  We praise her intellectual virtue precisely because she allows truth-tracking norms rather than idiosyncratic attractions to drive belief.  Mutatis mutandis, why should we condemn the moral agent who allows moral norms as such to guide action?  To do so can manifest a parallel form of practical rationality: the capacity to subject one\u2019s will to impartial, authoritative standards.  \n\nIV. The case for praiseworthiness  \n\n1. The value of principled reliability.  An agent whose will is fixed on \u201cdoing what is right\u201d is often more reliably responsive to moral reasons than one whose motives are piecemeal affections.  Concern only for friends may falter when strangers suffer; sympathy may be swamped by irritation.  The de dicto agent, by contrast, need not wait for sentiment: she has in place a standing, intrinsically moral motive.  Reliability, of course, is not the whole of moral worth, but it is undeniably part of why we value moral dispositions.\n\n2. The achievement of reflective endorsement.  Human beings are not merely loci of sentiment; we are reflective creatures who can step back, ask what we ought to do, and regulate ourselves accordingly.  Exercising that capacity is intrinsically admirable.  Acting from duty manifests a kind of practical self-legislation: I acknowledge a claim on me that is not reducible to my contingent likes and dislikes, and I freely bind myself to it.  That achievement is praiseworthy even when the claim I acknowledge is only \u201cthis is right,\u201d rather than \u201cthis will aid her welfare.\u201d\n\n3. Respect for persons in general.  De dicto moral motive may encode respect not for this or that person\u2019s welfare, but for the moral status of all persons as such.  Kant\u2019s \u201cpractical standpoint\u201d treats each rational agent as a lawgiver in the kingdom of ends; the will determined by duty therefore expresses equal respect.  That respect, though abstract, is hardly alienating; it is a way of showing regard for every person\u2019s claim to be treated justly.\n\nV. Meeting the objections  \n\nA. \u201cMoral fetishism\u201d: the charge that de dicto motive is wrongly focused on a property\u2014rightness\u2014that lacks intrinsic value.  \n\nReply: first, rightness is not a mysterious non-natural property but shorthand for the set of objectively authoritative reasons.  Wanting to comply with authoritative reasons is no more fetishistic than wanting to eat nutritious food because it is healthy.  Second, the critic slides illicitly from \u201cthe agent cares about rightness\u201d to \u201cthe agent cares only about rightness.\u201d  Nothing prevents a de dicto agent from also caring about concrete values; the question is whether caring also, or even primarily, about rightness diminishes moral worth.  I deny that it does.\n\nB. \u201cAlienation\u201d: the agent who saves his wife \u201cfrom duty\u201d seems alienated from his personal relationship with her.  Williams\u2019s celebrated case: thinking \u201cit\u2019s my duty\u201d is \u201cone thought too many.\u201d  \n\nReply: The worry conflates moral worth with expressive adequacy inside particular relationships.  My love for my partner had better show up somewhere in my motivational set\u2014but it need not be the sole or even decisive motive at the critical moment.  Suppose my partner and a stranger are both drowning; only one can be saved.  My de dicto sense of duty instructs me that I may permissibly favor my partner.  Acting on that judgment involves both love and duty; to say the second is \u201cone thought too many\u201d ignores that responsible agents of integrity do sometimes reflect on moral permissibility inside intimate engagements.  Moreover, there are contexts\u2014public office, professional roles\u2014in which reference to duty shields us from morally illicit partiality.  A judge who sentences fairly \u201cbecause it is her duty\u201d does not exhibit alienation; she manifests fidelity to the public reason that legitimates her authority.\n\nC. \u201cMotivational thinness\u201d: de dicto desire lacks the motivational oomph that concrete concern supplies.  \n\nReply: Empirically dubious: history brims with activists whose generic commitment to justice powered immense sacrifice.  Even if duty is sometimes motivationally weaker than emotion, sufficiency for moral worth concerns not strength but kind.  A quiet but effective motive can fully ground praise.\n\nVI. When duty fails  \n\nMy thesis is not that duty always suffices.  Three categories mark failure:\n\n1. Epistemic negligence: if I make no effort to ascertain what duty requires and simply act on guesswork, the de dicto motive is undercut.  Moral worth demands at least minimally competent uptake of moral reasons.  \n\n2. Bad faith: if I treat \u201cduty\u201d as a post-hoc rationalisation for what really moves me (fear of blame, social image), then the apparent de dicto motive is a mask.  Then praise is unwarranted.  \n\n3. Higher-order defeaters: in specific relational contexts, acting solely from duty can rightly be criticised when a richer motive is expected and would have been available without moral cost.  A soldier who writes a condolence letter to a fallen comrade\u2019s family strictly \u201cbecause it is his duty\u201d may convey coldness.  No contradiction arises: one can grant that such action is morally permissible and minimally worthy while still holding that it falls short of excellence.  \n\nVII. The Kantian pedigree strengthened  \n\nKant\u2019s notorious claim that only actions undertaken from duty have moral worth has often been interpreted as de dicto.  But Kant\u2019s own illustrations\u2014shopkeeper, philanthropist\u2014show he worries not about abstractness per se but about whether the agent\u2019s motive is conditioned on coincident inclination.  The central Kantian idea is that the moral law must be recognized as binding \u201cfor the sake of the law.\u201d  That is practically identical with a de dicto motive.  If the law is genuinely moral, not merely conventional, then de dicto adherence to it is exactly what respect for persons requires.  Far from fetishistic, it testifies to autonomous rational agency.\n\nVIII. Comparative virtues  \n\nVirtue ethicists often object that an exclusive focus on duty misses the centrality of character.  But the regulative ideals of virtue and duty are not mutually exclusive.  A virtuous agent, as Julia Annas argues, is one who sees what reasons apply and is motivated by them as such\u2014in effect, by duty.  Conversely, commitment to duty can cultivate virtues: honesty, temperance, courage, justice.  The supposed dichotomy stems from a too-narrow reading of both traditions.\n\nIX. Agency, autonomy, and self-respect  \n\nModern moral psychology emphasises autonomy: the capacity to act on principles one has reflectively endorsed.  Acting from de dicto duty is a paradigm exercise of autonomy: one filters desires through practical judgment, aligning oneself with what one takes to be objectively required.  This activity underwrites both self-respect and respect for others.  In Nelson Mandela\u2019s prison writings, he insists he was moved above all \u201cby a sense of duty to the people.\u201d  We do not find this morally impoverished; we find it heroic.  Mandela\u2019s case also illustrates how de dicto duty often goes hand in hand with love, solidarity, and other concrete motives; yet the very fact that duty could sustain him when other motives might falter shows its independent moral worth.\n\nX. Synthesis: plural bases of moral worth  \n\nThe sensible conclusion is pluralistic.  Morally worthy action can be motivated in at least three principal ways:\n\n1. By de re concern for the valuable features that make the act right (empathy, friendship, care).  \n2. By de dicto concern to do what moral reasons require (duty).  \n3. By hybrid structures that combine (1) and (2).\n\nEach basis has comparative advantages and limitations.  Their coexistence enriches moral life; none is universally superior.  The attempt to rule out (2) as always inadequate underestimates the breadth of human moral agency.\n\nXI. Practical upshot  \n\nIn education and character development we should cultivate both sensitivity to concrete values and principled commitment to doing the right.  Teaching children simply to follow moral rules without instilling sympathy risks dryness; teaching them only to care about others without anchoring that care in principled respect risks parochial bias.  Mature agents need both: the heart that feels and the will that resolves.\n\nXII. Conclusion  \n\nActing solely from a desire to do what is morally right can indeed suffice for morally worthy conduct.  Such action is praiseworthy because it manifests (a) reliable responsiveness to authoritative reasons, (b) the distinctive human achievement of reflective self-governance, and (c) respect for persons in their capacity as rational ends in themselves.  The standard objections\u2014fetishism, alienation, motivational thinness\u2014either misconstrue the nature of de dicto motive or mistake contingent shortcomings for conceptual flaws.  De dicto duty is no less genuine, no less admirable a moral motive than compassion or friendship; it is one vital strand in the rich tapestry of the moral life.  The challenge for each of us is not to choose between duty and concrete concern, but to integrate them so that, come what may, we can both feel the pull of others\u2019 needs and stand ready, simply and firmly, to do what is right.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 10, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 2923, "reasoning_tokens": 192}

Can acting solely from a desire to do what is morally right suffice as a motive for morally worthy conduct?

In this essay I argue that it can: a de dicto desire to do the right thing, even when no other motive is present, can fully ground moral praiseworthiness. I begin by clarifying the notions at stake (\u00a71). I then reconstruct the two most influential objections\u2014the \u201cmoral-fetishism\u201d charge that the agent\u2019s gaze is fixed on an abstract property rather than on the concrete features that matter (\u00a72), and the \u201calienation\u201d worry that duty-only agents are estranged from the values morality serves (\u00a73). The heart of the essay (\u00a74) provides a three-part reply: (A) a conceptual argument that a de dicto desire cannot be successfully acted on unless the agent is appropriately responsive to right-making considerations; (B) a normative argument that treating rightness as an independent source of motivation constitutes a distinctive form of respect for persons; and (C) a practical argument that the duty motive yields especially reliable, situation-proof moral conduct. I close by distinguishing moral worth from other evaluative dimensions (lovability, admirability, saintliness) and sketching why additional motives can enhance, though are not required for, praiseworthiness (\u00a75).\n\n1. Clarifying the Question\n\n1.1 De dicto vs. de re desire. A de re desire to help Maria concerns that very person: \u201cI want to help her.\u201d A de dicto desire to do the morally right thing is contentless with respect to particulars: \u201cI want to do whatever is right.\u201d Our question is whether that second, more abstract desire can make an act worthy of praise when it operates alone.\n\n1.2 Moral worth. I adopt a broadly Kantian notion: an action has moral worth when it is attributable to the agent as a response to moral reasons\u2014when it manifests the agent\u2019s commitment to doing the right thing because it is right. Moral worth is distinct from (i) the action\u2019s rightness, which concerns what ought to be done, and (ii) the agent\u2019s moral character in the thick sense that includes warmth or charm. The shopkeeper who gives correct change merely to build reputation acts rightly but without moral worth; the one who does so \u201cfor the sake of duty\u201d has moral worth.\n\n1.3 The sufficiency claim. I defend:\n\nSufficiency Thesis: An action produced solely by the motive of duty\u2014understood as a de dicto desire to act rightly\u2014possesses moral worth.\n\nI remain neutral on whether the duty motive is also necessary for moral worth, or whether mixed motives diminish worth. My target is the common claim that duty alone is inadequate.\n\n2. The Moral-Fetishism Objection\n\nThe label originates with Barbara Herman and Michael Smith. The charge is roughly this:\n\n1. Morally commendable agents are motivated by what makes an act right (other-regarding concern, fairness, promise-keeping).  \n2. A pure duty motive is aimed at rightness as such, not at those concrete considerations.  \n3. Acting from the duty motive therefore exhibits a \u201cfetishistic\u201d fascination with an abstract property, leaving the agent insensitive to the real-world values morality tracks.\n\nCompare someone who weds you because you are \u201cmy legally assigned spouse,\u201d not because of love or companionship. Something seems off: the relation is valued only under a formal description, not for its substantive goods. Likewise, the critic says, morality is about people\u2019s needs, avoidable suffering, freely given consent; the duty-bound agent fixates on a thin label\u2014\u201cthe right\u201d\u2014and thus misses what morally matters.\n\n3. The Alienation Objection\n\nSusan Wolf\u2019s famous \u201cMoral Saints\u201d essay epitomises the second worry. The dutiful person, especially in Kant\u2019s austere portrait, appears chilly, joyless, estranged from friends, art, and humor. Even if she does no wrong, her life seems diminished; other motives (love, sympathy, excitement) have been crowded out by an impersonal commitment to the moral law. The result is an agent alienated not only from her personal projects but from the very individuals her actions are supposed to help. She helps the needy because \u201cduty demands it,\u201d not because she cares about them. Can such help be fully commendable?\n\n4. Three Replies in Defence of Duty\n\n4.1 Conceptual reply: Implementing a de dicto desire requires tracking the right-making reasons.\n\nSuppose Ann decides \u201cI will do what is morally right.\u201d To realise this aim she must ask, in each concrete choice, \u201cWhat would be right here?\u201d That further question pushes her to consider precisely the welfare, dignity, justice, or fidelity facts that determine rightness. A mere label cannot guide action; the agent needs a grasp of its extension. That grasp can be practical rather than theoretical\u2014tacit sensitivities, habits of attention, empathetic imagination. But without responsiveness to those concrete features, the agent could not reliably satisfy her de dicto desire. She would fail in her own terms.\n\nAn analogy: desiring to hit the bullseye is abstract compared with desiring to let the arrow fly at 47.8\u00b0 given the wind. But the archer who genuinely wants to hit the bullseye will adjust for wind and distance; otherwise the desire is idle. Likewise, a morality-aiming agent must track what morality concretely requires.\n\nThis undermines Premise 2 of the fetishism argument. The de dicto desire, by its own logic, entails engagement with right-making reasons. It is not a substitute for them but a higher-order orientation that organises and prioritises them. True, the content of the desire is schematic, but its satisfaction conditions are richly textured.\n\n4.2 Normative reply: Valuing rightness qua rightness expresses respect for persons.\n\nWhy is the right thing right? Standardly because it treats persons with appropriate regard: it protects their interests, honours their autonomy, or realises fair distributions. But the question before us is motivational: What is praiseworthy about being moved by the fact that an action is morally required? My answer: a duty motive expresses the judgment that other persons are sources of binding reasons independently of my contingent feelings toward them. By taking \u201cthe right\u201d as an unconditioned reason, the agent affirms the equal authority of moral claims across all persons and contexts.\n\nContrast two rescuers. Beth pulls a stranger from a river because she feels sudden compassion; Claire pulls him out because she recognises he has a claim on her assistance\u2014\u201cIt was the right thing to do.\u201d Suppose both act promptly and skillfully. Beth manifests a valuable capacity for sympathy; Claire manifests a valuable capacity for recognizing and responding to moral reasons. Each capacity merits praise, but the second conveys a distinctive form of respect. Sympathy\u2019s motivational force may vary with distance, salience, or group membership; recognition of rightness does not. In that way, the duty motive embodies a commitment to persons as such, avoiding partiality and arbitrariness.\n\nCritics sometimes retort that real respect must involve personal concern, not cold compliance. Yet we ordinarily see that principled action is a way of taking others seriously. Imagine someone who cheerfully violates your property rights whenever it benefits her friends, explaining, \u201cDon\u2019t worry\u2014I still like you.\u201d You would likely prefer the dutiful neighbour who restrains herself because it is wrong to trespass, even if she feels little warmth. The normative truth that persons are owed fair treatment is itself a value we care about others upholding. Acting for that reason is therefore praiseworthy.\n\n4.3 Practical reply: The duty motive supplies stability where concrete sentiments falter.\n\nMany right-making considerations trigger motivational resonance only intermittently\u2014sympathy when the victim is vivid, gratitude when the benefactor is present, environmental concern when a glacier melts on screen. A de dicto desire to act rightly functions as a regulative backup system. It motivates when first-order sentiments are weak or silenced by fatigue, fear, or self-interest. Kant\u2019s point in the \u201cdry misanthrope\u201d example is not that benevolence lacks value, but that a sense of duty is reliably action-guiding even when one is tired, hurt, or depressed.\n\nReliability is not a trivial virtue. Imagine you need someone to execute your last will. You want a friend who will persevere though the document is dull, though beneficiaries are strangers, though no one is watching. The agent who is governed by the categorical imperative is predictably steadfast. That robustness underlines why we praise the duty motive. Morality\u2019s authority is supposed to be unconditional; a desire that mirrors that unconditionality is especially apt.\n\n5. Objections Reconsidered\n\n5.1 Is it still fetishistic?\n\nOne might reply: Even if a de dicto desire must consult right-making facts, the agent\u2019s occurrent motive can remain the thin fact that the act is right, not the thicker facts about need or consent. Something is lost in moral psychology: the rescuer should be moved by the victim\u2019s peril, not by the abstract status of obligation.\n\nI grant that additional motives often enrich an action\u2019s meaning. It is better when the parent feeds her infant out of love as well as duty. Yet we must separate two claims:\n\n(Enhancement) Concrete concern can add value.  \n(Sufficiency) Absence of such concern robs the act of all moral worth.\n\nMy defence targets Sufficiency, not Enhancement. Moral worth is secured once the agent acts for the right reason with adequate understanding. Nothing in that picture denies that supplementary motives may render the act more admirable or the agent more lovable.\n\n5.2 Doesn\u2019t the victim prefer benevolence?\n\nSociological studies show that help accompanied by warmth is typically perceived as more welcome. But moral worth is about the agent\u2019s stance toward duty, not about what sort of aid the recipient would most enjoy. From the first-person point of view, what makes my act praiseworthy is that I respond to an authoritative claim. The recipient\u2019s preference shapes the content of that claim\u2014no one wants to be treated like a \u201cbundle of duties\u201d\u2014yet the motivational spring that secures compliance can still be duty.\n\nIn fact, many victims care deeply that helpers recognise their rights. A disabled passenger may prefer assistance grounded in respect for her autonomy rather than pity. Acting from duty communicates: \u201cYou are owed this, not merely the object of my sentiment.\u201d\n\n5.3 Epistemic arrogance?\n\nAnother worry: claiming to act from duty presumes certainty about what morality requires. If that certainty is misplaced, praiseworthiness evaporates. Here we must refine the account. A conscientious duty-motive includes appropriate epistemic humility: the agent aims to do what is right and, recognising her fallibility, seeks evidence, listens to testimony, considers disagreement. Acting \u201cfrom duty\u201d need not entail dogmatism; it might involve delayed judgment, inquiry, and revision. What matters is that the inquiry is undertaken because the agent is committed to getting morality right.\n\n5.4 Do costs matter?\n\nFollowing Kant, many hold that moral worth increases when the agent overcomes contrary inclination. The sufficiency thesis as stated does not deny that. An act from duty can involve cost (the merchant resists temptation) or no cost (the cheerful helper). Either way, the source of praiseworthiness is the agent\u2019s responsiveness to moral reasons. Cost can amplify the evidence for that responsiveness, but the motive\u2019s presence, not its strenuousness, is the fundamental ground.\n\n6. Broader Landscape: Morality and the Mixed Motive\n\nEmphasising the sufficiency of duty invites a misconception\u2014namely, that philosophers who defend it valorise icy rigorists. That would be an error. Most of us hope for lives in which duty, sympathy, friendship, aesthetic joy, intellectual curiosity, and playful spontaneity interweave. Moral worth is only one mode of evaluation among many; a rich human life includes but also surpasses it. The present thesis is a modest conceptual point: when other motives are absent or even contrary, the duty motive can shoulder the full justificatory burden.\n\nConsider the solitary whistle-blower who exposes corruption despite feeling no love for the victims and no personal benefit\u2014indeed at great personal cost. The abstract judgment \u201cThis is the right thing to do\u201d sustains her. To deny her moral worth because her motive lacks warmth seems perverse. Her act may be precisely the exemplary case of moral praiseworthiness.\n\n7. Conclusion\n\nThe charge that a pure duty motive is hollow misunderstands both its functional structure and its ethical significance. Structurally, a de dicto desire to act rightly cannot guide behaviour without recognition of the very right-making particulars critics worry are ignored. Normatively, treating morality as a source of binding reasons in its own right is a powerful way of respecting persons as equals. Practically, the duty motive ensures steadiness where fickle sentiments fade. For those three reasons, an action done solely from duty can possess full moral worth.\n\nThis conclusion neither denigrates benevolence nor romantic love. It simply places the duty motive on the honours list alongside them. Morality\u2019s authority sometimes demands that it be front and centre. When it is, and when an agent responds wholeheartedly to the thought \u201cThis is what is right,\u201d we have all the ingredients needed for genuine moral praiseworthiness.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 11, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 3402, "reasoning_tokens": 576}
{"question_id": "ISSEROW-MORALWORTH-2020", "question": "Many philosophers have argued that the motive of duty\u2014understood as a de dicto desire to do what is morally right\u2014cannot suffice for moral worth. On their view, praiseworthy agents must be motivated by the concrete considerations that explain why their actions are right (such as concern for others' welfare), rather than by an abstract concern for morality as such. Critics charge that agents motivated solely by duty exhibit a kind of moral fetishism or alienation from what morality is really about. Can acting solely from a desire to do what is morally right suffice as a motive for morally worthy conduct? If so, what makes such dutiful action praiseworthy?", "answer": "1. Introduction  \n\nWhen we praise someone for acting well, we usually have in mind not only what she did but also why she did it. The utilitarian who rescues a drowning child in order to maximise aggregate welfare and the sentimental friend who jumps in out of love both elicit admiration, while the cynical politician who does the same in hope of favourable press strikes us as morally wanting. Philosophers have long tried to articulate what sort of motivational structure underwrites moral worth. One prominent view\u2014defended by Kant but resisted by many contemporary writers\u2014holds that acting \u201cfrom the motive of duty,\u201d that is, from a de dicto desire to do what is morally right, is sufficient for the highest moral worth. The opposing camp claims that this \u201cduty motive\u201d is too abstract, and that genuine moral worth requires motivation by the very concrete considerations that render the act right (the child\u2019s danger, a friend\u2019s distress, an oppressed person\u2019s dignity, etc.). Otherwise, the agent allegedly displays a form of moral fetishism, a chilly allegiance to \u201cmorality\u201d rather than to the people and values morality is about.\n\nMy aim is to defend a qualified \u201cyes\u201d: acting solely from a desire to do what is morally right can suffice for moral worth, provided that the agent\u2019s abstract concern is epistemically and practically well-formed. I will argue, first, that the de dicto motive, properly understood, is not a fetishistic stance but a second-order regulative commitment whose content already includes sensitivity to the right-making features of actions; second, that the duty motive secures distinct virtues\u2014reliability, impartiality, and integrity\u2014that are themselves good-making; and third, that the familiar objections either misunderstand the psychology of the de dicto desire or mistakenly presume a zero-sum rivalry between duty and concrete concern. I conclude that we have good reason to regard pure dutiful action as praiseworthy, though in ordinary human agents it will rarely occur without some admixture of more particular motivations.\n\n2. De dicto versus de re moral motivation  \n\nLet us begin by clarifying the target. A de re moral desire takes the form \u201cI want to \u03d5 because of C,\u201d where C is some concrete consideration that makes \u03d5 the right thing to do\u2014say, \u201cbecause it will relieve Sam\u2019s pain.\u201d A de dicto moral desire is instead \u201cI want to do what is morally right.\u201d On its face the latter appears content-thin; it refers to rightness without specifying what makes the relevant act right.\n\nYet the de dicto-de re contrast can be drawn in two importantly different ways.\n\na) Strict psychological reading. Here the content of the agent\u2019s motivating desire is only the thin proposition \u201cthat I act morally rightly.\u201d The agent has no further motivational grip on more specific right-making facts.\n\nb) Hierarchical or guidance reading, associated with Harry Frankfurt\u2019s distinction between first- and second-order desires. On this model the de dicto desire functions as a higher-order commitment: \u201cWhatever ultimately makes an action right, I commit myself to acting for those reasons.\u201d It governs the agent\u2019s first-order deliberation by directing her to search for and respond to the right-making features. Such an agent can act from duty alone even though her practical reasoning inevitably traverses concrete considerations, which she now treats as derivative of her de dicto commitment.\n\nKantian ethics adopts something closer to (b). Kant repeatedly notes that respect for the moral law necessarily manifests itself through obedience to its material dictates\u2014one cannot simply recite \u201cI do the right\u201d while ignoring what the Categorical Imperative demands in a given case. Hence understood, the duty motive does not bypass substantive moral reasons; it coordinates them.\n\n3. The charge of moral fetishism  \n\nThe worry of \u201cfetishism\u201d (often associated with Michael Smith and Julia Markovits) can be distilled into three claims:\n\n(1) Descriptive. A pure duty-moved agent attends only to the fact of rightness, not to the valuable features that make the act right.\n\n(2) Normative. Morally admirable agents ought to care about those valuable features; failing to do so evinces an objectionable detachment or alienation.\n\n(3) Explanatory. Because the duty motive blocks appropriate sentimental engagement, such agents are less reliable at producing good actions across contexts.\n\nIf these claims are correct, acting solely from duty would not qualify for moral worth, or at least not as much as acting from concrete concern.\n\n4. Why the duty motive can suffice for moral worth  \n\nI now present three lines of defence.\n\n4.1 The duty motive as a second-order gatekeeper  \n\nA primary task of moral motivation in finite, fallible agents is to organise the welter of competing first-order impulses\u2014self-interest, partial affection, momentary passions\u2014so that conduct remains answerable to moral requirements. A de dicto desire admirably fills this gatekeeper role. It does not replace first-order sensitivity to people\u2019s needs or to justice; rather, it authorises and disciplines it. When one acts solely from this motive, one\u2019s first-order affective responses are themselves recruited under the guidance of duty: \u201cThis child\u2019s welfare is a reason for me because morality recognises it as such, and I am committed to morality.\u201d Therefore the \u201cthinness\u201d objection misfires. The agent is motivationally related to the child\u2019s welfare, but that relation is mediated by her standing commitment to do what morality requires.\n\n4.2 Reliability across contexts  \n\nBecause duty is a second-order commitment, it enjoys a kind of robustness that more particular concerns often lack. Specific affections, sympathies, or utilitarian calculations may fluctuate with mood, proximity, or cognitive load. The dutiful agent, by contrast, possesses a stable practical identity: she acts as morality dictates, even when the beneficiaries are unknown or when no sympathetic affect is triggered (e.g., future generations, statistical victims). This reliability is itself a moral virtue. We prize the doctor who treats each patient conscientiously, not only those she happens to like. Consequently, when the doctor acts \u201cjust because it is right to render aid,\u201d that is precisely what makes her trustworthy and so praiseworthy.\n\n4.3 Integrity and equal respect  \n\nFinally, the duty motive embodies a valuable internal relation to one\u2019s own rational agency. To will an action as right because it is right is to affirm one\u2019s status as a free, self-legislating agent responding to reasons that any similarly situated agent can in principle appreciate. This stance secures both integrity (one acts from principles one can own) and equal respect (one acknowledges the standing of all agents subject to the same principles). These are not empty formalities. In moral tragedy\u2014when duties conflict with powerful personal attachments\u2014the capacity to act for the right reason, even at great cost, is what we honor. Sophie\u2019s refusal to betray a colleague under totalitarian threat, based solely on the principle that betrayal is wrong, is paradigmatically admirable.\n\n5. Replies to the main objections  \n\n5.1 \u201cBut the duty-bound agent doesn\u2019t care about people!\u201d  \n\nA standard illustration is the helpful neighbor who assists you \u201conly\u201d because it is her duty, not because she cares about you. Intuitively this seems cold. Yet careful phenomenology suggests otherwise. The duty-bound neighbor\u2019s motivational story is: (i) People\u2019s welfare morally matters; (ii) My neighbor\u2019s current welfare is at stake; (iii) I therefore assist, out of commitment to what morally matters. This agent does care about you, though the caring is structured by her principled allegiance rather than by contingent affection. The perceived coldness arises when we artificially strip away step (i) or (ii); but those steps are essential to a Kantian reading of duty.\n\n5.2 The alienation worry  \n\nBernard Williams argued that moral theories that demand impartial adherence can alienate agents from their personal projects and relations. However, the duty motive need not forbid personal projects; it merely subjects them to a higher-order test of permissibility. Indeed, genuine friendship arguably benefits from such regulation. A friend who refuses to lie for you when lying would harm innocent others may strain your immediate interest but ultimately honors both you and the moral community. Her stance says: \u201cI respect you enough to treat you as a moral equal, not as someone on whose behalf I would sacrifice innocent third parties.\u201d That is the opposite of alienation.\n\n5.3 Epistemic sensitivity  \n\nA subtler objection notes that the de dicto desire might encourage excessive moral deference: the agent consults authorities or social consensus rather than critically engaging with concrete facts. Yet one can distinguish between motivational content and epistemic method. Nothing in the desire \u201cto do what is right\u201d licenses lazy deference; on the contrary, it should spur diligent inquiry into what rightness demands. An agent who treats hearsay as sufficient evidence that \u03d5 is right thereby manifests not an excess of duty but a defect of epistemic virtue.\n\n6. Synergy rather than competition  \n\nAlthough I have defended the sufficiency of the duty motive, I do not claim it is always morally preferable to act from duty alone. Often the richest moral agents integrate the de dicto commitment with a flourishing repertoire of sentiments\u2014empathy, love, solidarity. But these are complements, not replacements. The Kantian can happily grant that an action motivated both by duty and by sympathy may carry an added aesthetic or relational value. All I deny is that the presence of duty sans sympathy necessarily renders the act morally inferior. Sometimes, given human limitations, the duty motive is precisely what ensures right action when sympathy falters.\n\n7. Two test cases  \n\nConsider first the professional judge who must impose a harsh but just sentence on a defendant. Whether or not the judge feels compassion, we regard her as duty-bound to uphold justice; we do not impugn her moral worth if her primary motive is \u201cbecause it is my duty.\u201d Indeed we distrust judges who let personal feelings override duty.\n\nSecond, imagine a pandemic in which volunteers are desperately needed for vaccine trials. Alex signs up solely because he believes it is the morally right thing to do. He has no relatives at risk, feels no special sympathy for strangers, and is not excited by adventure. Nonetheless he endures weeks of discomfort. It seems counterintuitive to withhold praise here. Alex\u2019s dutiful motive, free of egoistic or tribal bias, is admirable precisely because it testifies to the impartial moral point of view.\n\n8. A virtue-theoretic reconstruction  \n\nThose still wary of Kantian language may prefer a virtue-ethical gloss. On that view, what makes a trait a virtue is that it reliably aligns action with the morally right and is motivated by appropriate perception of the good. The duty motive can be redescribed as the virtue of conscientiousness: a stable disposition to seek out and comply with moral reasons. Far from being a cold fetish, conscientiousness is a central civic virtue; societies could not function if people helped others only when they happened to feel warm sentiments. Thus even virtue ethics, once freed from caricature, recognises the praiseworthiness of dutiful action.\n\n9. Limits and qualifications  \n\nI have defended the moral sufficiency of pure duty, but three caveats are in order.\n\na) Psychological development. In children and moral novices, abstract duty detached from feeling may be brittle. Cultivating empathy and habituated concern is often pedagogically necessary for someone later to sustain the de dicto commitment under stress.\n\nb) Pathological scrupulosity. An agent whose duty motive degenerates into obsessive guilt or self-punishment may do what is right but in a spirit that undermines her own flourishing. Aristotelian eudaimonia reminds us that moral worth coexists with competing values, including psychological health.\n\nc) Misguided moral codes. Finally, if an agent\u2019s moral beliefs are gravely mistaken, acting from duty can lead to evil. The sufficiency claim presupposes basic moral reliability; otherwise we risk praising the ideologically fanatical. But this is no special problem for duty motivation\u2014misguided sympathy or love can do equal harm.\n\n10. Conclusion  \n\nActing solely from the desire to do what is morally right can indeed suffice for moral worth. Properly understood, the duty motive is not an alien, contentless fetish, but a second-order regulative commitment that integrates and disciplines first-order practical reasoning. It confers distinctive virtues of reliability, impartiality, and integrity, allows agents to navigate the diversity of moral life without undue dependence on variable sentiments, and signals equal respect for all moral persons. While a fully ideal agent may harmonise duty with rich particular affections, none of this diminishes the praiseworthiness of the person who, faced with a hard choice, acts simply because it is the right thing to do.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 12, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 2988, "reasoning_tokens": 320}
{"question_id": "ISSEROW-MORALWORTH-2020", "question": "Many philosophers have argued that the motive of duty\u2014understood as a de dicto desire to do what is morally right\u2014cannot suffice for moral worth.

Critics charge that agents motivated solely by duty exhibit a kind of moral fetishism or alienation from what morality is really about. Can acting solely from a desire to do what is morally right suffice as a motive for morally worthy conduct? If so, what makes such dutiful action praiseworthy?", "answer": "Can acting solely from a desire to do what is morally right suffice as a motive for morally worthy conduct? I shall argue that it can. The desire to do the right thing \u201cde dicto,\u201d when properly understood, embodies (i) an appropriate form of respect for the moral law, (ii) the right kind of responsiveness to moral reasons, and (iii) a reliable disposition to act rightly across a wide range of circumstances. These three features make such dutiful action praiseworthy even when no further concrete motive\u2014such as sympathy, friendship, or beneficence\u2014plays a decisive role. The familiar charge of \u201cmoral fetishism\u201d misconstrues the architecture of dutiful motivation and fails to appreciate how an abstract concern with rightness can preserve and express the very values that morality is \u201creally about.\u201d\n\nI. Framing the Dispute\n\nPhilosophers distinguish two ways in which an agent might care about morality. An agent can care about morality \u201cde re,\u201d being moved by the very features that make an act right (for instance, Jane helps an injured stranger because she is moved by the stranger\u2019s suffering). Alternatively, she can care \u201cde dicto,\u201d being moved by the fact that the act is morally right, whatever its right-making features happen to be. The critics of dutiful motivation insist that while de dicto concern may yield correct action, it cannot ground moral worth. Bernard Williams, Michael Stocker, and other virtue theorists contend that exclusive reliance on formal duty displays a kind of moral alienation: it turns the agent\u2019s attention away from the concrete human goods\u2014flourishing, friendship, relief of suffering\u2014that morality tries to protect.\n\nKantians, by contrast, famously claim that acting from duty confers a distinctive moral worth that other motives, however amiable, cannot secure. Yet even within Kantian circles there is disagreement about what \u201cacting from duty\u201d really comes to. Contemporary Kantians such as Barbara Herman and Markovits maintain that an agent acts from duty only when she is motivated by the right-making considerations themselves, not merely by the abstract thought that an act is right. So, the dispute is alive even within Kant\u2019s camp.\n\nMy strategy will be to defend a minimal but robust notion of de dicto dutiful motivation and show why it meets the standards of moral worth. The defense proceeds in four steps:\n\n1. Clarify what a properly formed de dicto desire to do what is right involves.\n2. Show that such a desire guarantees sensitivity to the very considerations the critics think are important.\n3. Argue that praiseworthiness depends primarily on this kind of sensitivity and reliability, not on the particular first-order motive tokens present.\n4. Defuse the accusation of moral fetishism by exposing its equivocations.\n\nII. What Is It to Desire \u201cto Do What Is Right\u201d?\n\nA common caricature portrays the duty-bound agent as someone who mutters, \u201cI must do the morally correct thing,\u201d while having no idea or concern about why the act is correct. Such an agent would indeed be culpably oblivious. But this is not what a genuine de dicto desire to do what is right consists in.\n\nThe desire can be analysed as a standing, higher-order commitment:\n\nD: For any situation S, if \u03c6-ing is the morally right thing to do in S, then I shall \u03c6.\n\nThere are three crucial points about D.\n\na. Cognitive component. To act on D, the agent must form some belief about what the right thing is in her circumstances, and that belief must derive from a genuine exercise of moral judgment. So acting under D presupposes responsiveness to the grounds of moral rightness.\n\nb. Deferential, not blind. The agent does not fetishize the mere label \u201cmorally right.\u201d Rather, she adopts a policy of doing whatever the best moral reasons dictate. In this way, D is analogous to a scientist\u2019s policy \u201cto believe whatever the best evidence supports.\u201d Nobody thinks the scientist thereby fetishizes truth; instead, we see the policy as expressing a proper respect for evidence.\n\nc. Dynamically integrated. D is not an inert principle added onto life\u2019s routines. It shapes deliberation, attention, and emotional dispositions. A person governed by D will, in virtue of wanting to do the right thing, cultivate the capacities\u2014empathy, discernment, impartiality\u2014that are needed to recognize what rightness requires.\n\nIII. Sensitivity and Moral Worth\n\nMost philosophers now agree that moral worth involves more than mere right action. A helpful recent formulation is:\n\nResponsiveness Condition (RC): An action has moral worth only if the agent\u2019s motive makes her responsive to the facts that render the action right.\n\nDoes D meet RC? Yes. Although the agent\u2019s ultimate aim is de dicto (\u201cact rightly\u201d), the practical route to that aim travels through the right-making considerations. She must notice the suffering stranger, grasp its moral significance, and recognize aid as a requirement of beneficence. Otherwise, she cannot identify aid as \u201cthe right thing.\u201d So the same process of recognition that a virtue theorist prizes is required by D itself.\n\nAn analogy: Suppose I vow to follow the advice of the best medical authorities because I want to stay healthy. When I decide to exercise more, I do so in virtue of concrete medical reasons about cardiovascular fitness. My de dicto desire (to follow medical advice) funnels through de re reasons (exercise benefits health). Similarly, the desire to do what is morally right funnels through the substantive grounds of rightness.\n\nThus, RC does not discriminate between de dicto and de re motives. Both can satisfy it or fail, depending on the quality of the agent\u2019s reasoning. A cold bureaucrat who declares \u201cIt\u2019s the rule\u201d without understanding why exhibits poor responsiveness. But the failure is epistemic, not structural: her grasp of what duty demands is shallow. The remedy is fuller moral understanding, not abandonment of duty as a motive.\n\nIV. Reliability Across Cases\n\nAnother dimension of moral worth concerns reliability: Is the agent disposed to track moral reasons across varied scenarios, including those where her natural sympathies may run counter to them? The de dicto motive scores well here. Because the object of D is rightness itself, the motive is relatively stable in the face of changing first-order incentives. Sympathy is a valuable sentiment, but sympathy can flag when beneficiaries are distant or unappealing. A pure philanthropist animated by D will keep her commitments even when she feels no warmth. That reliability is itself praiseworthy; it reflects a kind of moral steadfastness or integrity.\n\nA well-known worry holds that such steadfastness can shade into rigidity. But steadfastness only becomes vice when it ceases to be responsive: when it persists despite decisive reasons to the contrary. Because D\u2019s very content links action to reasons, the agent is protected from blind rigidity. She will persist only so long as she judges the action right.\n\nV. Fetishism Reconsidered\n\nBernard Williams introduced the \u201cfetishism\u201d charge against utilitarian and Kantian motivations: the agent allegedly treats moral rightness as a fetish object detached from human concerns. Let us diagnose two equivocations in the charge.\n\n1. Conflating ultimate and proximate motivation. The fetishism story implies the agent is moved solely by the fact that an act is right, and not at all by its human consequences. But as we saw, a de dicto motive operates via the agent\u2019s recognition of those very consequences. They are not motivationally idle; they are the indispensable route to identifying the act as right.\n\n2. Mistaking critical distance for alienation. Moral agents sometimes need to step back from their immediate sentiments in order to judge impartially. That critical distance can feel cold when compared with spontaneous affection, but it is not alienation. Imagine a parent who forces herself to punish her child fairly despite intense favoritism. She may experience the demand of duty as abstraction, yet we do not judge her alienated. We admire her capacity to let rightness overrule bias.\n\nThe upshot is that the fetishism charge goes through only if we imagine dutiful agents who, perversely, refuse to acknowledge any ground for rightness beyond its being right. But such creatures are either conceptually impossible (because rightness is always grounded in something) or epistemically defective (they do not know what makes acts right). Neither case undermines the coherent ideal of de dicto duty bounded by understanding.\n\nVI. The Ecology of Motives\n\nSome contend that a wholly duty-driven life would be emotionally impoverished even if individually dutiful acts possess moral worth. I agree. Human virtue is plural; we rightly prize love, friendship, compassion, humor. Nothing in D excludes these supplementary motives. The claim I defend is conditional: when D operates alone\u2014say, because compassion is momentarily absent\u2014it is sufficient, though not always optimal.\n\nThink of mountaineering equipment. A rope that can bear your weight is sufficient to keep you from falling, even if redundancy would be better. Similarly, de dicto duty suffices for moral worth even if a richer motivational ensemble would be ideal.\n\nVII. Kant and Contemporary Kantians\n\nDoes my defense simply echo Kant? Partly, but it parts company with some modern readings. Kant writes that an action has \u201cgenuine moral worth\u201d only when done \u201cfrom duty\u201d and \u201ccontrary to inclination.\u201d Critics reply that Kant thereby exalts self-denial. A more charitable reading is that Kant chooses \u201cagainst inclination\u201d cases because they make the presence of duty vivid. He never denies that sympathetic acts can be dutiful and morally worthy; he claims only that we cannot tell whether sympathy alone would have moved the agent. The textual debate is complex, but on the charitable reading Kant is no fetishist. The motive of respect for the moral law embodies reverence for rational nature, not slavish rule worship.\n\nContemporary Kantians such as Herman offer a stricter view: acting from duty requires being motivated by the right-making considerations themselves, not by the abstract thought that the act is right. My counter-proposal is ecumenical. The strict view is one way of filling in D, but not the only way. What matters is reliable responsiveness; whether the agent experiences it as a concern for rightness or for the specific grounds is secondary.\n\nVIII. Two Objections and Replies\n\nObjection 1: De dicto duty cannot discriminate between competing moral theories. An agent might desire to do what she falsely believes is right (say, racist moral code) and still satisfy D. So D is morally blind.\n\nReply: All accounts of moral worth confront the problem of mistaken belief. Sympathy can be misinformed too. The correct fix is a truth-connection clause: praiseworthiness requires that the agent\u2019s moral judgments be at least minimally accurate or non-culpably mistaken. This condition is independent of whether the motive is de dicto or de re.\n\nObjection 2: Exclusively dutiful agents lack moral joy; they perform burdensome self-sacrifices and thereby manifest an impoverished character.\n\nReply: Joy is indeed valuable, but not constitutive of moral worth. Consider a firefighter who, exhausted and afraid, drags victims from a burning building solely because he judges it his duty. That act is paradigmatically praiseworthy. If later he grows to love the thrill of rescue, so much the better; yet the initial dutiful act was not deficient. Moreover, many agents experience a deep, even if quiet, satisfaction precisely in living up to duty. So the picture of joyless drudgery is empirically dubious.\n\nIX. The Positive Value of De Dicto Duty\n\nI have so far argued for sufficiency; let me end by highlighting the affirmative virtues of dutiful motivation.\n\n1. Autonomy: The agent acts on reasons she can, in principle, share with every rational being. This universalizability embodies respect for others as equals.\n\n2. Integrity: Because D is content-neutral regarding personal attachments, it helps agents resist corrupting pressures (tribalism, nepotism). It acts as a moral gyroscope.\n\n3. Reflective equilibrium: De dicto concern encourages deliberation about moral principles, fostering moral development and reducing unexamined bias.\n\n4. Civic reliability: In pluralistic societies, we often lack shared emotions. A common commitment to do what is right supplies a bridge across divergent sympathies.\n\nX. Conclusion\n\nThe desire to do what is morally right, taken in abstraction, can look bloodless. Yet abstraction is not necessarily detachment, and impartiality is not indifference. A properly formed de dicto motive requires and cultivates sensitivity to the substantive values\u2014welfare, justice, respect\u2014that make acts right. It renders the agent reliably responsive to moral reasons across changing contexts. Because moral worth consists in acting for the right reasons with reliable responsiveness, dutiful action, even when driven solely by that abstract desire, suffices for praise.\n\nThis conclusion should not be read as a rejection of the virtues lauded by the critics. Compassion, friendship, and solidarity are central components of a well-rounded moral life. My claim is merely that when, for whatever reason, those richer motives fall silent, the humble desire to do what is right can still carry the day\u2014and we do well to admire the moral strength it displays.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 13, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 3232, "reasoning_tokens": 448}

Can acting solely from a desire to do what is morally right suffice as a motive for morally worthy conduct? If so, what makes such dutiful action praiseworthy?", "answer": "Acting Solely from Duty: Fetishistic Formalism or Paradigm of Moral Worth?\n\n1. Introduction  \n\nImagine a harried physician in a field hospital. Exhausted and numb, she no longer feels compassion surge when a new casualty is rushed in; what nonetheless propels her to sterilise her instruments and operate is one fixed thought: \u201cThis is what morality requires of me.\u201d Is her performance still worthy of praise? Many contemporary moral psychologists and virtue theorists say no. To act well, they insist, is to be animated by the very considerations that make the act right\u2014concern for the soldier\u2019s pain, love for humanity, solidarity with the wounded. A merely de dicto desire \u201cto do the morally right thing\u201d allegedly reveals a moral fetishism: the agent\u2019s attention clings to an abstract property (rightness) rather than to the people, needs or values that confer that property. In what follows I argue that, appearances notwithstanding, a pure duty motive can indeed suffice for moral worth. Far from being a cold formalism, such an orientation manifests a distinctive form of respect for persons, an expression of autonomous self-government, and a reliable sensitivity to moral reasons. When these features are present, the dutiful agent merits praise even if no other concrete sentiments accompany her act.\n\nThe essay proceeds in five steps. Section 2 clarifies the distinction between (a) acting from the concrete right-making considerations and (b) acting from the abstract thought that the deed is right. Section 3 surveys the main objections: Stocker\u2019s \u201cschizophrenia of modern ethical theories,\u201d Railton\u2019s charge of alienation, and Blum\u2019s account of moral perception. Section 4 develops a Kantian-inspired defence: respect for the moral law is not contentless but embodies a second-personal acknowledgement of every rational agent\u2019s authority. Section 5 explains why this motive can track concrete reasons without fetishistic mediation, drawing on contemporary work on de dicto versus de re desires and on the epistemic role played by second-order principles. Section 6 responds to remaining worries about coldness and motivational reliability, before Section 7 concludes.\n\n2. De dicto and De re Moral Motivation  \n\nA motive is de dicto if it is directed at a proposition under a general description: \u201cI want to do whatever is morally required.\u201d By contrast, a motive is de re if it latches onto some particular feature of the situation: \u201cI want to prevent that child\u2019s pain.\u201d The present debate asks whether the first kind of desire, by itself, can make an action morally worthy. Two preliminary remarks matter.\n\nFirst, in any realistic agent the two kinds of motivation are usually interwoven. An ordinary helper may think \u201cThat child is suffering, so I must act; that\u2019s the right thing to do.\u201d Nonetheless, for philosophical clarity we can isolate limiting cases where only one desire is causally efficacious.\n\nSecond, \u201csolely from duty\u201d need not mean \u201cwithout knowledge of the concrete facts.\u201d A surgeon who operates because it is required is not ignorant of the patient\u2019s plight; she simply does not care about it as such. Her caring takes the abstract form \u201cWhoever needs me, I must help.\u201d Critics claim that exclusive reliance on this form is deficient.\n\n3. Three Lines of Critique  \n\n3.1 Michael Stocker: Motivational Schizophrenia  \nStocker imagines a friend who visits one in hospital solely because friendship demands it. We would feel chilled: the visitor\u2019s eye is on a moral ledger, not on us. Modern moral theories, Stocker concludes, induce a \u201cschizophrenia\u201d between the reasons they acknowledge (friend-promotion, benefit) and the motives they commend (duty). Because harmony between reasons and motives is part of our common-sense ideal, acting from duty alone is morally second-best.\n\n3.2 Richard Railton: Alienation  \nRailton\u2019s worry is that deontic motives estrange us from the worldly goods that make life meaningful. If a spouse kisses her partner \u201cout of duty\u201d rather than affection, something deep has gone wrong. Morality should integrate rather than supplant human attachments; otherwise it alienates us from ourselves and from others.\n\n3.3 Lawrence Blum: Moral Perception  \nBlum argues that caring motives enable direct perception of morally salient features. One who cares about a child perceives its vulnerability more readily than the cold moralist. Hence purely de dicto orientation threatens practical reliability: lacking the right sentiments, the fetishist may frequently misjudge or overlook what morality in fact requires.\n\nTaken together, these three critiques seek to establish that a motive of duty is (a) affectively impoverished, (b) personally alienating, and (c) epistemically unreliable\u2014and thus cannot ground full moral worth.\n\n4. A Kantian Reply: Respect as Substantive  \n\nKant famously claims that \u201cnothing can be called good without qualification except a good will,\u201d and a good will acts \u201cfrom duty.\u201d Many commentators, following Barbara Herman and Allen Wood, have shown that for Kant the motive of duty is not a vacuous abstraction but the agent\u2019s recognition of the unconditional authority of every rational being. To act from respect for the moral law is to acknowledge others as ends in themselves, to bind oneself by principles that any similarly situated rational agent could endorse.\n\nFour aspects of this view counter the fetishism charge.\n\n4.1 Second-Personal Structure  \nDuty is not a fascination with a mysterious property called \u201crightness.\u201d It is acceptance of demands that arise in the second-personal stance, what Stephen Darwall calls the \u201cmoral standpoint.\u201d When I help the wounded soldier because duty requires it, I respond to her claim on me as a fellow rational agent. That is a concrete relational attitude, not an occult attraction to the Form of the Good.\n\n4.2 Practical Universality  \nBecause respect abstracts from idiosyncratic attachments, it secures impartiality. This is not a bug but a virtue: it ensures that patients receive help whether or not the doctor happens to feel compassion that day. Reliability here flows from principle rather than feeling.\n\n4.3 Inner Freedom  \nDuty-based action expresses autonomy: the agent governs herself by reasons she can recognise as valid irrespective of inclination. Autonomy, many hold, is an intrinsically valuable achievement, worthy of praise even when other sentiments are absent.\n\n4.4 Integration Rather than Exclusion  \nKant does not prohibit additional motives. Sympathy may \u201cprepare the way\u201d for duty even if only respect has determining causal force. Hence respecting duty need not crowd out affection; it simply guarantees that in cases of conflict the moral law prevails.\n\nThese considerations undermine the thought that duty is an empty or fetishistic motive. But does it suffice for moral worth on its own?\n\n5. De dicto Desire without Fetishism  \n\nPhilosophers such as Mark Schroeder distinguish two ways a de dicto desire might function. The fetishistic version treats \u201crightness\u201d as a magnetic property divorced from reasons. The virtuous version functions as a higher-order disposition: \u201cI desire, of any available action \u03c6, to \u03c6 if and only if \u03c6 is supported by the balance of moral reasons R.\u201d This metadesire is substantive because its satisfaction conditions implicitly import whatever first-order reasons there are. Wanting to do what morality requires, in this sense, just is a standing commitment to respond appropriately to all right-making features, even if those features are not what one currently finds motivating in a first-order way.\n\nTo see this, compare epistemic motivation. A mathematician may be moved solely by love of truth: \u201cI want to believe what is mathematically correct.\u201d We do not rebuke her for failing to be aroused by the content of each theorem. Indeed we praise her intellectual integrity. Similarly, why should we censure a moral agent whose overriding concern is that her behaviour answer to whatever moral reasons there are? The charge of fetishism sticks only if we assume that responding to right-making reasons requires being affectively attracted by them. But desiring to conform one\u2019s will to them is precisely one way\u2014arguably the most direct way\u2014of responding.\n\n6. Addressing Worries about Coldness and Reliability  \n\n6.1 Coldness  \nCritics fear the coldness of pure duty because they confuse motivational sufficiency with evaluative supremacy. To say duty alone suffices for moral worth is not to deny that richer motivational textures often add value. A friend moved by affection and by duty is, all else equal, better. But sufficiency is a lower bar than optimality. A stripped-down engine can still power the car.\n\nMoreover, duty itself embodies a recognition-respect that is anything but icy. When the surgeon treats each soldier with equal care because each is a legislator in the kingdom of ends, she accords them a dignity higher than any sentimental preference could guarantee. Victims often crave precisely this: not pity, but recognition of their full moral status.\n\n6.2 Reliability  \nEmpirical literature on \u201cmoral identity centrality\u201d shows that those who self-conceive in moral terms are more consistent in helping behaviours across contexts. The de dicto commitment acts as a cognitive filter, prompting its bearer to seek out the operative moral facts. In contrast, empathy is situationally fragile. Thus concern for duty may be more, not less, reliable.\n\nOf course, a purely abstract do-gooder can misapply her principles. Yet the same holds of sentiment-driven agents, whose partialities and biases are well documented. The solution in both cases is moral education and critical reflection, not displacement of one motive by the other.\n\n6.3 Integrity and Non-Accidentality  \nAn action possesses moral worth only if it non-accidentally conforms to moral reasons. The agent must act because of those reasons, not merely in line with them. A de dicto orientation satisfies this requirement: the agent\u2019s explanatory reason is \u201cit is morally required,\u201d exactly the fact that makes the action right. Contrast an agent who helps because of a lucky impulse. Here the connection is accidental though the outward behaviour coincides. Duty therefore secures the tight explanatory nexus demanded by traditional accounts of moral worth.\n\n7. Three Test Cases  \n\na. The Impartial Benefactor. A philanthropist is unmoved by vivid TV footage of famine victims but donates because reason tells him it is obligatory. His funds save thousands. Most would applaud, even if we might also wish he felt compassion. Praise is especially warranted because he would have donated had the cameras been off; his motive is principled, not publicity-driven.\n\nb. The Scrupulous Judge. A judge finds a defendant repugnant but sets this aside, decides according to law, and cites his duty to uphold justice. That motive suffices for praiseworthy judicial conduct; indeed any contrary sentiment would be suspect. The case illustrates contexts where duty is the uniquely appropriate ground.\n\nc. The Exhausted Carer. Returning to our field surgeon: when fatigue dulls her empathy, only duty keeps her at the operating table. We do not strip her of moral worth for lacking vivacious compassion; we honour her steadfastness.\n\nThese scenarios suggest that common moral practice already credits duty as sufficient\u2014so long as the agent\u2019s commitment is genuine and effective.\n\n8. Alienation Revisited  \n\nDoes a duty-bound life estrange one from the goods of love and friendship? Not if the agent\u2019s commitment to morality itself includes a commitment to cultivate such goods where appropriate. Kant urges beneficence, gratitude and sympathetic participation in others\u2019 joy precisely because the moral law obligates us toward the ends of others. Thus treating morality as supreme does not preclude, but rather systematises, our engagement with substantive values.\n\nMoreover, autonomy itself is a good in human life. Persons value being related to one another as free and equal, not as passive recipients of sentiment. A world in which every helper could honestly say \u201cI served you because you are a rational being with inviolable claims\u201d would not be alienating; it would be a world of recognised dignity.\n\n9. The Second-Order Advantage  \n\nA purely sentiment-driven agent must hope that her emotions reliably track moral reasons\u2014but emotions are partial and narrow-band. A de dicto orientation is self-corrective. When the agent suspects that her habitual principles misfire, the very desire to \u201cdo what is right\u201d demands that she revise them. Hence duty, though abstract, possesses an internal mechanism of critical checking that first-order motives typically lack.\n\n10. Objections and Replies  \n\nObjection 1: De dicto duty is too formal to guide action.  \nReply: Formal desire functions together with deliberative procedures that identify the relevant principles; guidance emerges from their conjunction. Analogy: \u201cAct so as to maximise expected utility\u201d is abstract, yet when joined with evidence and calculation, it guides decisions.\n\nObjection 2: Praiseworthiness requires warmth; duty lacks it.  \nReply: Warmth is an aesthetic or interpersonal desideratum, not a necessary condition of moral worth. We admire firefighters who rescue strangers from burning buildings whether their hearts brim with fellow-feeling or not. Their courage and sense of duty suffice.\n\nObjection 3: Duty can be neurotic, stemming from authoritarian upbringing.  \nReply: When duty springs from fear or heteronomous conditioning, moral worth is indeed absent. My claim is conditional: if the agent\u2019s commitment is autonomous and understood, then it suffices. Pathological variants are excluded by the autonomy condition.\n\n11. Concluding Synthesis  \n\nMoral worth, I have argued, consists in acting because of the facts that make an action right. A de dicto desire to do what morality requires can realise this condition in a non-accidental, autonomy-expressing manner. Far from fetishistic or alienated, such motivation affirms the equal authority of persons and exhibits a universal concern untainted by parochial bias. While richer motivational palettes often add value\u2014friendship enriched by affection, family life by love\u2014the austere commitment to duty is a moral bedrock, capable on its own of sustaining praiseworthy conduct when other motives falter. We therefore should not rescind our admiration from the over-worked surgeon, the even-handed judge, or the principled philanthropist simply because their animating thought is, \u201cThis is what morality requires.\u201d In such cases the motive of duty is not a pale substitute for genuine concern; it is a distinct and dignified form of genuine concern\u2014concern for persons as such, under the moral law.

{"question_id": "Jenkin-EpistemicRoleCore-2020", "question": "Some philosophers argue that in order for a mental state to be based on epistemic reasons (and thereby have an epistemic status as justified or unjustified), the subject must be consciously aware of those reasons. This poses a challenge for views that hold that modular, automatic cognitive processes can involve genuine epistemic basing. Does lack of conscious awareness of one's reasons preclude a mental state from being epistemically based on those reasons?", "answer": "1. Introduction  \n\nThe basing relation is what links the propositional reasons one possesses to the doxastic attitudes one adopts. If S believes that p because S believes that q and (q \u2192 p), then S\u2019s belief that p is based on those reasons, and\u2014other things equal\u2014qualifies as justified. A natural thought, entrenched in much of the epistemological tradition, is that basing is an essentially conscious, deliberative affair. It seems that the believer must in some sense \u201ctake\u201d q and (q \u2192 p) to support p if p is to be epistemically grounded in that support. Yet research in cognitive science paints a very different picture of the mind\u2019s operations. Perceptual modules, statistical learning mechanisms, and fast heuristics routinely generate beliefs and judgments that are epistemically respectable even though the subject lacks any conscious grasp of the information-processing that produced them. Are such outputs genuinely based on reasons, or do they merely causally arise from non-rational mechanisms?  \n\nAnswering this question forces us to adjudicate between two broad theses.  \n\nA. The Awareness Requirement (strong form): For S\u2019s attitude toward p to be epistemically based on the reason r, S must consciously represent r as supporting p. Absent such awareness, the attitude is not justified (or at best only accidentally correct).  \n\nB. The Unconscious Basing Thesis: Conscious awareness is not required. What matters is that the relevant information plays the right explanatory and counterfactual role in the cognitive system that produced the attitude; conscious endorsement is optional.  \n\nI will argue that the strong Awareness Requirement is untenable. A weaker accessibility condition is defensible, but once the details are filled in, the position collapses into a form of reliabilism or competence epistemology that concedes basing can occur without occurrent awareness. Thus lack of consciousness does not, in general, preclude a mental state from being epistemically based on reasons.  \n\n2. Motivations for the Awareness Requirement  \n\nWhy think consciousness is necessary? Three intertwined considerations dominate the literature.  \n\na. Transparency and First-Person Authority. Intuitively, when we ask ourselves why we believe as we do, the reasons seem \u201cintellectually transparent.\u201d I can cite the evidence in support of p, and it is natural to suppose that my ability to avow those grounds is partly constitutive of the belief\u2019s justification.  \n\nb. Deontic Intuitions. Many epistemologists conceive justification on the model of epistemic permissibility or responsibility. If being justified is akin to not violating an intellectual obligation, then it must be something within the agent\u2019s purview\u2014something the agent could in principle heed or disregard. Conscious basing satisfies this demand; sub-personal causation apparently does not.  \n\nc. The Taking Condition. John Turri, Susanna Siegel, John McDowell, and others maintain that genuine reasoning involves the subject\u2019s \u201ctaking\u201d one proposition to support another. This \u201ctaking\u201d is alleged to be conscious or at least poised for conscious endorsement. Without it, the transition from reasons to conclusion is brute, not rational.  \n\n3. Three Problems for the Strong Awareness Requirement  \n\nEach motivation has force, but all run into trouble once we examine actual cases of belief formation.  \n\nProblem 1: Perceptual Justification. When I perceive a red cup, my belief that \u201cthere is a red cup in front of me\u201d is surely justified. Yet few of us are consciously aware of the complex reasons (retinal stimulation patterns, low-level edge detection, color constancy mechanisms) that sub-serve that belief. The proponent of the Awareness Requirement will reply that the relevant reason is simply \u201cI see a red cup,\u201d a fact available to consciousness. But what does \u201cI see\u201d add? If it is merely the experience itself, then the subject is not aware of a proposition that serves as a premise; rather, the experience non-conceptually presents the object. Our ordinary perceptual beliefs appear justified by processes of which we have no reflective grasp.  \n\nProblem 2: Implicit Statistical Inference. Consider the airline baggage screener who, after thousands of exposures, becomes highly reliable at distinguishing dangerous from benign images but cannot articulate the cues she relies on. Or the \u201cchicken sexer\u201d who accurately sorts male from female chicks within milliseconds. Their judgments manifest a competence shaped by experience; the underpinning information is appropriately responsive to evidence; yet it eludes consciousness. If conscious awareness were required, we would have to brand these agents\u2019 beliefs unjustified, a verdict that flies in the face of both intuitive and theoretical desiderata.  \n\nProblem 3: Computational Tractability. From a cognitive-scientific perspective, most of the mind\u2019s epistemic labor occurs below the level of conscious awareness. If epistemic status tracked only what rises to the surface, justification would be hostage to the severe bandwidth limitations of consciousness (about 40\u201360 bits per second). We would have to declare the bulk of our perceptual, memorial, and linguistic beliefs unjustified. Such skepticism is not only implausible; it undermines the practical purpose of epistemic evaluations.  \n\n4. Distinguishing Kinds of Awareness  \n\nDefenders of the Awareness Requirement often retreat to weaker notions. They may concede that occurrent phenomenology is unnecessary, insisting instead on:  \n\n\u2022 Access Awareness: The subject could, by reflection, become aware of the reason.  \n\u2022 Virtual Awareness: The reason is represented in working memory, though attention may not be focused on it.  \n\u2022 Dispositional Awareness: The subject possesses the concepts needed to bring the reason to consciousness if asked.  \n\nYet each weakening dilutes the original thesis. Access awareness collapses into something like mentalist evidentialism: what matters is that the subject\u2019s total mental life contains the reason, where \u201cmental\u201d ranges over occurrent and dispositional states. But once dispositional states count, most sub-personal representations will qualify, provided they are appropriately integrated with the person-level system. The awareness constraint thus ceases to exclude unconscious basing and loses its critical bite.  \n\n5. Causal vs. Doxastic Basing  \n\nIt is common to distinguish two senses of \u201cbecause\u201d in epistemology.  \n\n\u2022 Causal basing: r caused S to believe p.  \n\u2022 Doxastic basing: S believes p because S takes r to support p.  \n\nThe Awareness Requirement attaches to doxastic basing. However, many epistemologists now argue that doxastic basing, so construed, is neither necessary nor sufficient for justification. Timothy Williamson notes that a true clairvoyant who consciously \u201ctakes\u201d random inner hunches to certify distant events is not justified, whereas a normal perceiver whose brain causally tracks the environment is. Causal relevance can confer justification when the cause instantiates the right epistemic function, even if the subject is not aware of it.  \n\n6. Control, Responsibility, and Credit  \n\nA lingering intuition is that epistemic praise or blame must latch onto features under the agent\u2019s control. If I am blind to my own reasons, how can I deserve credit for believing well? Virtue reliabilists reply that credit accrues to competences rather than to conscious performances per se. An archer earns praise for hitting the target even if much of the motor execution is automatized. Likewise, an epistemic agent merits credit when her cognitive faculties\u2014shaped by training, evolution, or deliberate practice\u2014reliably link truth-conducive reasons to beliefs. Conscious reflection can enhance or impair these competences, but is not the sole locus of epistemic agency.  \n\nNor is the absence of consciousness tantamount to lack of control. Automatic processes are typically flexible, learnable, and subject to higher-level modulation. The baggage screener can recalibrate her standards after feedback, indicating that she retains indirect control over the inferences her system draws. Control is distributed across time and levels of processing, not confined to moment-to-moment awareness.  \n\n7. The Epistemic Role of Conscious Reflection  \n\nAlthough I reject the claim that consciousness is required for basing, the phenomenology of reasoning still has epistemic value. Conscious reflection serves at least three functions:  \n\n1. Error Correction. Explicit reasoning can uncover conflicts, detect defeaters, and override heuristics prone to systematic bias.  \n2. Communicability. Justification often matters in social contexts\u2014testimony, pedagogy, scientific explanation\u2014where reasons must be articulated. Awareness facilitates this transmission.  \n3. Systematic Expansion. Complex, multi-premise reasoning exceeding the capacity of intuitive systems demands deliberate symbol manipulation.  \n\nThus consciousness is a virtue amplifier, not a sine qua non of epistemic status.  \n\n8. A Competence-Constitutive Account of Basing  \n\nHow, then, should we understand basing without awareness? I propose the following sufficient condition:  \n\nCB (Competence Basing). S\u2019s belief that p is epistemically based on r just in case:  \ni. r is represented (consciously or unconsciously) within S\u2019s cognitive system;  \nii. The system contains a competence that maps representations of type r to belief that p in a way that is sensitive to the epistemic relation between r and p;  \niii. The mapping is appropriately integrated with S\u2019s higher-level cognitive economy (e.g., defeaters can be registered; the belief can guide action; S can, given normal prompting, update or withdraw p when r changes).  \n\nCondition (ii) secures non-accidentality: the competence must treat r as a reason, not merely as a cause correlated with p. Condition (iii) ensures personal-level ownership. Basing, on this view, is realized by the functioning of reasons-sensitive competences, and these competences need not issue in conscious awareness at the time of belief formation.  \n\nThis account explains why the airline screener\u2019s judgment is justified: it is the manifestation of a finely-tuned visual-categorization competence sensitive to diagnostic cues. It also explains why the clairvoyant is not justified: the mechanism linking her hunches to distant truths is not a competence responsive to reasons; it is an uncontrolled, epistemically opaque faculty.  \n\n9. Objections and Replies  \n\nObjection 1: The Taking Objection. Without conscious \u201ctaking,\u201d no genuine reasoning occurs; the competence story reduces reasons to causes.  \n\nReply: The key is to distinguish between subpersonal causes that merely covary with truth and subpersonal capacities that are themselves reasons-responsive. A competence embodies an internal model of the world, encoding conditional dependencies (often probabilistic). When that model is exercised, the system proceeds because it treats the input as evidence. In virtue-theoretic terms, it manifests \u201cepistemic sensitivity\u201d\u2014a form of taking, albeit one not always available to introspection.  \n\nObjection 2: The Swamping Problem. If justification rests solely on reliable competences, then knowledge and justified belief reduce to reliability, failing to account for the special value of epistemic achievements that involve understanding one\u2019s grounds.  \n\nReply: The competence view does not deny that reflective awareness adds epistemic value; it denies only that such awareness is necessary for minimal justification. We may define higher-grade statuses\u2014understanding, wisdom, reflectively endorsed knowledge\u2014that require consciousness. But ordinary justified belief, sufficient for most practical purposes, can be achieved without it.  \n\nObjection 3: The New Evil Demon. A victim of a Cartesian demon may have all the same conscious experiences yet lack reliable competences. If reliability is necessary, the view incorrectly withholds justification.  \n\nReply: The competence account can be internalist about possession of the competence rather than about its external success. What matters is that the cognitive system functions as it ordinarily does given its design environment, not that it happens to succeed in the actual world. The demon victim\u2019s perceptual system is still epistemically apt in this sense; its failures are due to adversarial manipulation, not to defects in the competence. Thus justification is preserved.  \n\n10. A Taxonomy of Epistemic Statuses  \n\nThe debate often conflates distinct normative categories. We can sharpen matters by distinguishing:  \n\n\u2022 Prima facie Justification: absence of defeaters, competence functioning properly.  \n\u2022 Reflective Justification: the agent can cite (some of) her reasons on demand.  \n\u2022 Understanding: grasp of the explanatory nexus linking reasons to conclusion.  \n\nOn this hierarchy, conscious awareness is necessary for reflective justification and understanding, but not for prima facie justification. The latter suffices for knowledge on many theories, whereas the higher statuses ground deeper intellectual virtues.  \n\n11. Implications for Modular and Automatic Processes  \n\nResearch on face recognition, syntax parsing, intuitive physics, and causal inference supports the conclusion that humans possess myriad domain-specific systems that extract structured information and draw inferences without conscious oversight. Denying epistemic standing to these outputs would gut human cognition of warrant. Instead, we should treat these systems as legitimate bearers of reason-guided competences. They forge the substructure upon which deliberate reasoning later builds.  \n\nHowever, not all automatic processes are epistemically benign. Confirmation-bias modules, stereotype activation, and wishful\u2010thinking mechanisms also operate unconsciously but are responsive to motivational cues rather than to truth. The competence framework distinguishes the epistemically virtuous from the vicious by focusing on what the system is functionally tuned to do: track truth versus serve self-enhancement goals.  \n\n12. The Future of Epistemic Agency  \n\nAccepting unconscious basing reshapes our conception of intellectual responsibility. Epistemic self-improvement is not restricted to polishing explicit argumentation; it includes cultivating automatic competences (e.g., improving statistical intuitions, debiasing perception) through training, environment design, and social scaffolding. The locus of responsibility shifts from momentary conscious acts to long-term regulation of one\u2019s cognitive architecture.  \n\nMoreover, as artificial intelligence integrates with human cognition, many of our \u201creasons\u201d will be processed by external prostheses opaque to introspection. An epistemology that ties justification to occurrent awareness risks obsolescence. Competence-centered theories accommodate these developments: what matters is that the combined human-machine system embodies truth-tracking competences and remains sensitive to defeaters, not that the human can verbalize every computational step.  \n\n13. Conclusion  \n\nConscious awareness of one\u2019s reasons is epistemically valuable, but it is not the litmus test for basing. The strong Awareness Requirement falters in the face of everyday perceptual belief, skilled expertise, and the empirical realities of cognition. A more plausible picture sees basing as the manifestation of reasons-responsive competences, many of which belong to fast, automatic, and frequently unconscious systems. Such competences confer prima facie justification provided they are properly integrated into the agent\u2019s cognitive economy and remain amenable to higher-level monitoring and correction.  \n\nThus lack of conscious awareness does not, in itself, preclude a mental state from being epistemically based on reasons. What is essential is that the reasons be appropriately processed by epistemic competences whose function is to connect truth-indicative information to belief. Conscious reflection refines, articulates, and sometimes overrides these processes, but it need not be present at the moment of belief formation for justification to arise.  \n\nApproximate word count: 2,080.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 0, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 3616, "reasoning_tokens": 448}

Introduction  \n\nMost epistemologists agree that a belief is *justified* only if it stands in the right explanatory relation to some appropriate *reasons*.  What is disputed is whether the subject must *consciously* represent those reasons in order for that explanatory relation\u2014the basing relation\u2014to obtain.  On one side are *access internalists* who maintain that justification is, at least in principle, transparent to the thinker.  On the other side stand *externalists* and a growing body of cognitive-science\u2013friendly philosophers who insist that many genuine cognitive achievements are subpersonal and opaque.  The challenge is sharpened by contemporary work on modular, automatic inference: Bayesian updating in perception, linguistically encapsulated \u201cfast paths\u201d in language comprehension, affective heuristics in social cognition, and so on.  These mechanisms appear to marshal genuine evidence and produce belief-like states, yet the subject often has no introspective grasp of either their operation or their premises.  \n\nI will develop a sustained answer to the central question:  \n\n     Does lack of conscious awareness of one's reasons preclude a mental state \n     from being epistemically based on those reasons?  \n\nMy conclusion will be a qualified *no*.  Conscious awareness can deepen or enhance justification, but it is not a *necessary* condition for epistemic basing.  The argument proceeds in five stages:\n\n(1) Clarifying the target: what is it to *base* a belief on reasons?  \n(2) Presenting and evaluating three main arguments for the Awareness Requirement (AR).  \n(3) Showing how each argument over-reaches by conflating epistemic basing with higher-order endorsement.  \n(4) Offering a positive model\u2014call it the *Dispositional Competence* account\u2014that explains how subpersonal processes can directly confer justification.  \n(5) Addressing residual worries about responsibility and epistemic normativity.\n\nThroughout, I will use concrete cases from both everyday cognition and specialized empirical literature.  The guiding idea is that epistemic agency is scaffolded by subpersonal competencies, and those scaffolds can themselves be adequate bearers of epistemic support even when they lie outside the luminous field of consciousness.\n\n2. What Is Basing?\n\nTwo constraints dominate discussions of basing:\n\n   Causal Constraint:  The reasons must *cause* or sustain the target mental state.  \n   Epistemic Constraint:  They must do so in the *right* way\u2014viz., in a way that grounds \n                         justification or knowledge rather than merely producing the \n                         belief via wishful thinking or hypnosis.\n\nThe first constraint is uncontroversial; the second, notoriously slippery.  One central proposal, going back to Davidson, ties the right way to the agent's *rational appreciation* of the reason\u2019s support.  If a subject does not apprehend the explanatory connection, the result is a \u201cdeviant causal chain,\u201d incapable of underwriting epistemic status.  Davidson\u2019s picture naturally lends itself to an Awareness Requirement: the subject must *see* or appreciate X as evidence for P.\n\nYet not all philosophers follow Davidson.  Teleologists (e.g. Lycan), process reliabilists (e.g. Goldman), and virtue epistemologists (e.g. Greco, Sosa) allow that a belief can be well based if it is produced by a reliable or competently functioning cognitive disposition, even when the subject is blind to its workings.  For them the epistemically relevant property is not the subject\u2019s *perspective* but the mechanism\u2019s reliability or credit-worthiness.\n\nSo the conceptual terrain is divided.  But to assess whether consciousness is required we must examine *arguments*, not allegiances.  I turn now to three of the most influential.\n\n3. Three Arguments for Awareness  \n\n3.1. The Rational Control Argument  \n\nPremise 1:  Justification is a normative status that ought to guide practical and theoretical deliberation.  \nPremise 2:  Only what is *accessible to consciousness* can guide deliberation.  \nTherefore:  Only consciously accessible reasons can ground justification.\n\nThe intuitive appeal is that reasons are things for which we can *answer*.  If S cannot cite (or at least survey) the grounds for her belief, then she is at best fortunate to be right; she is not *rationally* justified.\n\nEvaluation.  Premise 2 is too strong.  Non-conscious information frequently guides deliberation.  Subliminal priming, emotional \u201cgut feelings,\u201d and automatic attention-shifts all demonstrably influence choice behaviour.  Indeed, many subjects manipulate their own environments\u2014e.g. by adopting \u201cshoebox filing\u201d systems or setting calendar alerts\u2014without explicit awareness of the intermediate rationale at each step.  What matters is that the cognitive system as a whole is *sensitive* to the evidential relationships, not that every such relationship be neurally broadcast to consciousness.  \n\nControl, moreover, is often *indirect*.  A chess master\u2019s intuitive move selections are justificatorily tied to thousands of pattern-recognitions she could not articulate.  She nonetheless exercises rational control: she would retract the move upon learning that the intuition sprang from a biased position reconstruction algorithm that misidentified a piece.  That counterfactual openness, not moment-to-moment awareness, seems the right measure of rational agency.\n\n3.2. The No-Coincidence Argument  \n\nPremise 1:  To be justified is to be *non-accidentally* right.  \nPremise 2:  Absent conscious awareness, the connection between reasons and belief is accidental from the agent\u2019s point of view.  \nTherefore:  Justification requires conscious awareness.\n\nEvaluation.  Premise 2 conflates the *agent\u2019s point of view* with the *epistemic point of view*.  The peppered moth\u2019s camouflage makes it non-accidentally invisible to predators even though the moth has no conception of camouflage.  Likewise, an infant\u2019s perceptual system non-accidentally tracks shape constancy despite the infant\u2019s conceptual blankness.  Epistemic luck is ruled out not by subjective surveyability but by the *modal* reliability of the link between evidence and belief.  If the subpersonal module would not deliver belief *but for* the truth-linking evidence, accidentality is already excluded.\n\n3.3. The Regress of Reasons Argument  \n\nPremise 1:  To base B on R, S must be capable of citing R.  \nPremise 2:  Citation itself requires a further belief about how R supports B.  \nTherefore:  Either there is an infinite regress or conscious awareness bottoms out in *dogmatic entitlement*.  \n\nAdvocates conclude that since dogmatic stopping points are epistemically suspicious, we must accept conscious awareness at the ground floor.\n\nEvaluation.  The regress is mis-described.  Suppose my perceptual system presents me with R: \u201cIt visually seems that there is a red apple.\u201d  I form B: \u201cThere is a red apple.\u201d  If challenged, I can cite R.  But do I need *another* belief that R makes B probable?  Not if R has the right default status\u2014e.g. if perception is prima facie trustworthy.  The regress ends in a standing competence rather than a further *belief*.  That competence may be subpersonal.  Bayesian perceptual modules approximate ideal observer norms without the agent believing any conditional probability axioms.  The stopping point is not dogmatic but methodological: it rests on the functional architecture of cognition that evolution and learning have tuned to the environment.\n\n4. Why Modularity and Automaticity Do Not Undermine Epistemic Basing\n\nEmpirical psychology identifies numerous automatic inferences:  \n\n\u2022 Phonological parsing converts acoustic patterns into word tokens.  \n\u2022 The visual system integrates lighting cues to recover surface color.  \n\u2022 Affective appraisal assigns valence to facial expressions within 200ms.  \n\nThese transformations are (a) swift, (b) mandatory, (c) informationally encapsulated, and (d) often inaccessible to introspection.  Yet they are sensitive to statistical structure and explain the *content* of downstream judgments.  When I believe \u201cShe is angry\u201d upon seeing her scowl, my reason\u2014her facial expression\u2014is not consciously tokened as a premise.  Still, the judgment is clearly *based* on that visual cue.\n\nOne might object that these are merely *causal antecedents*, not *epistemic reasons*.  But the difference evaporates once we employ a reliabilist or virtue-theoretic criterion:\n\n   Subpersonal Justification Principle (SJP):  \n   A token state R can justify belief B for subject S if and only if  \n   (i) R is reliably connected to the truth of B in nearby worlds, and  \n   (ii) S\u2019s cognitive system incorporates R in line with its design \n        plan for truth-conducive cognition.\n\nUnder SJP, the modular visual cue qualifies.  Condition (i) is satisfied by the ecological regularity that scowls typically signal anger.  Condition (ii) is met because the face-recognition module is precisely designed to transform that cue into the representation ANGER in circumstances under which the cue is diagnostic.  \n\nCritically, S need not *notice* R.  What matters is that her perceptual architecture treats R as evidence.  Analogously, a pocket calculator bases its display 7 on input \u201c3+4\u201d even though it lacks self-awareness.  The calculator case lacks normativity because it is not a subject; but for *subjects*, the subpersonal processes are integrated into a larger agency that can endorse or correct their outputs.  Conscious access is valuable at the reflective margin but not constitutive of basing.\n\n5. A Positive Model: Dispositional Competence\n\nWe can now articulate a middle path.  Call it Dispositional Competence (DC).\n\nDC Thesis:  \nA mental state M is epistemically based on reasons R iff  \n\n(1) R non-deviantly causes M via a process that is a manifestation of S\u2019s epistemic competence, and  \n(2) S is *counterfactually poised* to bring R (or surrogate considerations) to consciousness in contexts of critical scrutiny.\n\nExplanation:\n\n\u2022 Manifestation Clause.  Drawing on virtue epistemology, competence is the capacity to achieve true belief through reliable, truth-oriented faculties (vision, memory, logical inference\u2026).  If M issues from such a manifestation, the process is epistemically apt.  \n\n\u2022 Counterfactual Poise Clause.  We add that S *would* become aware of R were she to engage in appropriate reflection (e.g. \u201cWhy do I think she is angry?\u201d \u2014\u201cBecause of her facial expression\u201d).  Often this becomes possible only after ancillary theory building; still, the reasons are latent in a way that respects intellectual responsibility.  \n\nAdvantages of DC:\n\n(i) Reconciles Internalist Intuitions:  Because reasons are *available* to consciousness, S is not alienated from her cognitive basis.  If challenged, she can\u2014in normal conditions\u2014retrieve the reason.  \n\n(ii) Honors Empirical Findings:  Most processing is unconscious, yet the connection to reasons is preserved by the competence of the system.  \n\n(iii) Sidesteps Regress Worries:  Retrieval of reasons does not generate an infinite regress; the competence itself functions as the ultimate ground.\n\nCase Study: \u201cInstant\u201d Statistical Reasoning.  \nPeople can often tell which of two basketball players has the hotter hand without computing explicit frequencies.  Their gut feeling draws on an *approximate number system*.  Under DC, the belief \u201cPlayer A is hotter\u201d is justified because the subpersonal module tracks event density in a reliable, evolutionarily endowed way; and if asked \u201cWhy do you think so?\u201d the subject can at least cite the observable pattern (\u201cHe\u2019s been making more shots lately\u201d).  The fine-grained ratio calculus remains unconscious, but the coarse-grained reason is accessible.\n\n6. Addressing Objections\n\nObjection 1:  The Availability clause collapses into access internalism.  \n\nReply:  Crucially, availability is only *counterfactual*.  In the actual context of belief formation, no awareness need occur.  Many beliefs acquired seconds before a sudden death would thus be justified even though the subject never gets the chance to retrieve reasons.  \n\nObjection 2:  What about cases where no surrogate consideration is consciously recoverable\u2014e.g. the expert chicken-sexer who can tell male from female chicks but cannot say *how*?  \n\nReply:  Two possibilities arise.  (a) We might bite the bullet and say the chicken-sexer\u2019s belief is justified by virtue of extremely high-level competence even though no reason can be articulated.  DC can adopt this line because the surrogate for R might be the *testimony of introspective confidence* itself, which tracks first-order reliability.  Or (b) concede local failure of justification but hold that most automatic inferences do yield articulable surrogate reasons.  Either way the case does not vindicate a general awareness requirement.\n\nObjection 3:  Without consciousness, how can basing be *normative* rather than merely causal?  \n\nReply:  Normativity is secured by the function of the competence.  A perceptual module is *supposed* to track distal layout; a statistical learning mechanism is *supposed* to minimize prediction error.  Failures are thereby intelligible as malfunctions, mirroring the normative dimension of belief discourse.  Consciousness can register violation but is not itself the source of normativity.\n\n7. Epistemic Responsibility Revisited\n\nThe harshest criticism of non-conscious basing is moral: if the believer cannot inspect her reasons, she cannot be held epistemically responsible.  Yet responsibility comes in degrees.  Consider the hierarchy:\n\nLevel 1  \u2013  Involuntary subpersonal processing (edge detection).  \nLevel 2  \u2013  Automatic but defeasible heuristics (face-based trait inference).  \nLevel 3  \u2013  Conscious deliberation (explicit Bayesian reasoning).  \n\nWe properly blame someone at Level 2 when she *ignores evidence of systematic bias* that she could have learned through reflection, even though the first-order processing is unconscious.  Conversely, we do not blame her for Level 1 illusions resistant to reflection (e.g., M\u00fcller-Lyer lines).  The gradation shows that responsibility attaches to *reflective dispositions*, not to contemporaneous awareness.\n\n8. Conclusion\n\nDoes lack of conscious awareness inevitably deprive a mental state of epistemic basing?  I have argued, on balance, no.  The awareness requirement overintellectualizes belief formation and conflicts with the best explanations of cognitive success.  A more plausible picture distinguishes *having* reasons from *knowing that one has* reasons.  Subpersonal, modular mechanisms can embed genuine reasons in virtue of their reliable, truth-tracking design, and those reasons ground justification provided the agent possesses the competence to vindicate them under critical pressure.\n\nThis conclusion does not render consciousness epistemically idle.  Reflection enables *higher-order* justification, error correction, and the cultivation of epistemic virtues like open-mindedness and intellectual humility.  What it does eliminate is the idea that justification\u2019s foundations lie uniquely within the spotlight of awareness.  The spotlight illuminates only part of the stage; behind the scenes, a host of silent operators keep the show rationally on track.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 1, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 3486, "reasoning_tokens": 256}

Many philosophers\u2014including a large swath of \u201caccess internalists\u201d\u2014answer Yes. Others\u2014including most reliabilists, some virtue epistemologists, and an increasing number of empirically-minded philosophers of mind\u2014answer No. The debate matters for several ongoing projects: accounting for the epistemic standing of perceptual beliefs, explaining inferential transitions that occur sub-personally (for instance in Bayesian perceptual processes), and, more generally, understanding how epistemic normativity interfaces with the psychology of automatic, modular, and often unconscious cognition.\n\nThis essay argues that lack of conscious awareness of one\u2019s reasons does not in itself preclude a mental state from being epistemically based on those reasons. Conscious awareness may enhance epistemic status in various ways\u2014it can enable reflective endorsement, facilitate error-checking, and ground certain sorts of responsibility attributions\u2014but it is not a necessary condition on epistemic basing. To develop this claim, I proceed in four stages:\n\n1. Clarify the main positions: what \u201cbeing based on a reason\u201d amounts to, and how the awareness requirement has been motivated.\n2. Present three lines of argument\u2014phenomenological, epistemic-responsibility, and regress arguments\u2014in favour of the awareness requirement, and raise doubts about each.\n3. Develop a positive account of sub-personal or unconscious epistemic basing, drawing on contemporary cognitive science and on functionalist conceptions of reasons.\n4. Address residual worries: defeater handling, the possibility of epistemic luck in automatic cognition, and the role of higher-level awareness for full epistemic appraisal.\n\nI. Two conceptions of epistemic basing\n\nTo say that a mental state M (e.g. believing that the cup is on the table) is \u201cbased\u201d on some epistemic reason R is to say that R figures in the etiological explanation of M in a normatively appropriate way. The explanatory component signals causation: R causally contributes to the formation or sustenance of M. The normative component signals justification: R is the kind of consideration that makes M epistemically good to hold.\n\nThere are basically two families of views.\n\nA. Awareness-based (access internalist) basing:\n   i) Normative: Only mental states the subject could in principle cite in the first-person present tense qualify as genuine reasons.\n   ii) Causal: The subject\u2019s being in M must be due, at least in part, to her having conscious access to R (or a suitable disposition to become conscious of R on reflection).\n\nB. Awareness-unnecessary (externalist) basing:\n   i) Normative: A reason is any state of the world, or of the subject, that supports M in fact.\n   ii) Causal: M must be produced or sustained by a reliable, properly functioning, or intellectually virtuous process that tracks R, whether or not the subject is conscious of R.\n\nThe awareness-requirement is thus an epistemic analogue of act-requirement views in moral philosophy: just as some ethicists claim that an action only has moral worth if the agent acts for the right motive, some epistemologists claim that a belief is justified only if the believer believes for the right consciously accessible reason.\n\nII. Arguments for the awareness requirement and their limits\n\n1. Phenomenological purchase\n\nProponents often appeal to how it feels to believe on the basis of reasons. When I add 17 and 25 in my head and arrive at 42, I seem able to rehearse the steps. If asked why I believe it is raining, I can point to the dark clouds I saw through the window a moment ago. These presentations give the impression that epistemic basing involves occurrent awareness.\n\nBut the phenomenological data under-determines the thesis. First, not all conscious cognition is accompanied by articulate awareness: chess experts often \u201cjust see\u201d the best move, radiologists \u201cjust see\u201d the tumor. Introspectively, the reasons do not always march in with the belief. Secondly, there is good evidence that perceptual and linguistic inferences are typically sub-personal and yet yield justified beliefs. The conscious appearance, then, is selective: we are aware in some cases but not in many others. Phenomenology alone cannot settle the necessity question.\n\n2. Responsibility and appraisal\n\nAnother motive for the awareness requirement is epistemic responsibility. It is natural to think that one is blameworthy for believing on poor evidence only if one could have known better. Without conscious access to one\u2019s grounds, one lacks the requisite control or guidance to be held epistemically accountable.\n\nTwo replies are available. First, justification and blameworthiness come apart. We assess young children\u2019s perceptual beliefs as justified even though they cannot rehearse their reasons. Second, responsibility may not require direct awareness but only higher-order responsiveness. A cognitive system can be disposed to flag errors, revise beliefs when contrary evidence appears, etc., without the subject being able to cite reasons verbally. This sort of sub-personal sensitivity suffices for many responsibility attributions (compare non-reflective moral competence). The connection between responsibility and occurrent awareness is thus weaker than advertised.\n\n3. The Euthyphro or regress argument\n\nIf one\u2019s belief is justified only if one is aware of one\u2019s reason, and that reason is itself a belief, must one be aware of the reason for that belief, and so on ad infinitum? To avoid vicious regress, awareness theorists usually add a basing \u201cbuck-stopper\u201d: non-inferential seemings or perceptual experiences can justify directly, and we are consciously aware of those. Yet as Sellars\u2019s dilemma already highlighted, a brute experiential seeming cannot be simultaneously reason-providing and justificatory unless it is already taken as informative. So either the awareness theorist allows some unconsciously functioning acceptance of experience as reliable (thereby giving up the awareness thesis at the foundational level) or faces an untenable regress. This undermines the necessity claim.\n\nIII. A positive picture: sub-personal basing as reasons-responsive processing\n\nTo move beyond negative argumentation, we need an account of how modular, automatic, or unconscious processes can institute genuinely epistemic basing relations.\n\n1. Functional characterisation\n\nWe can characterise a basing relation functionally: a mental state M is based on R if\n\n   a) Sensitivity: variations in R would, in normal conditions, lead to systematic, non-deviant variations in M.\n   b) Proper functioning: the mechanism mediating the R->M transition operates according to its design plan (biological or learned) aimed at truth.\n   c) Integration: R and M are nodes within the same cognitive architecture, connected in a way that enables diachronic coherence checking and defeater processing.\n\nThese conditions are psychological and normative. They mirror familiar reliabilist or teleological accounts but enrich them with architectural detail: the basing mechanism must be able, over time, to respond to error signals and integrate contradictory information.\n\n2. Empirical illustration\n\n(i) Perceptual belief formation:\n   The visual system computes surface orientation from 2D retinal disparity through Bayesian inference. The \u201creason\u201d is a probabilistic pattern of disparity signals; the \u201cbelief\u201d is the perceptual judgment that the laptop is tilted. The subject is seldom aware of the disparity cues, but the computational link is robustly truth-aimed and sensitive. Lesions or deliberate manipulation of disparity cues predictably alter the judgment. On the functional criteria, the perceptual belief is based on those cues.\n\n(ii) Implicit statistical learning:\n   Adults quickly learn grammatical regularities of an artificial language after passive exposure. When later asked to classify new strings, they reliably discriminate grammatical from ungrammatical ones. Their classificatory judgments are epistemically grounded in the extracted transitional probabilities, though subjects often cannot articulate the rule. The sub-personal parser constitutes the basing mechanism.\n\n(iii) Moral heuristics:\n   Consider an experienced firefighter who, on entering a building, immediately senses that the floor will collapse and orders evacuation. Retrospective analysis reveals subtle heat patterns and smoke flows were the cues. Though the firefighter did not consciously note them, her decision was epistemically based on those environmental features processed by perceptual expertise.\n\n3. Theoretical upshot\n\nOn this picture, what matters for epistemic basing is not the presence of a phenomenally conscious token of the reason inside the subject\u2019s stream of thought, but the presence of the right kind of information-preserving, truth-directed link between reason and belief. Conscious awareness is epiphenomenal to that link.\n\nIV. Answering residual worries\n\n1. Defeaters and cognitive control\n\nSkeptics press: if the subject lacks awareness of her basis, how can she detect defeaters? Won\u2019t she remain unresponsive to undermining evidence?\n\nWe should distinguish synchronic and diachronic justifiability. At t1, a belief can be justified though its basis is unconscious. At t2, if the subject becomes aware of a defeater that the mechanism does not accommodate, the belief loses justification. Many automatic systems are defeater-responsive: predictive-coding models of perception constantly minimize error signals; implicit learning mechanisms recalibrate when statistics shift. When human subjects confront salient counter-evidence (say, feeling the floor is solid), higher-level processes frequently override the earlier perceptual expectation. The key is global responsiveness within the integrated architecture, not occurrent articulateness.\n\n2. Epistemic luck\n\nIf the subject does not grasp her grounds, might she just get things right by luck? Not if the mechanism is reliably connected to the truth. Compare moral luck debates: a surgeon may perform an operation successfully because her fine-grained motor control works flawlessly, even though she cannot describe each micro-adjustment. Success is not luck because competence, not coincidence, explains it. Analogously, perceptual competences underwrite non-luckily true beliefs.\n\n3. Graded epistemic status\n\nWhile I reject the necessity claim, I grant that conscious awareness often elevates epistemic status. Different goods cluster under the heading \u201cepistemic.\u201d We can distinguish:\n\n   a) Justificatory good: being based on adequate reasons.\n   b) Reflective good: being able to represent and assess those reasons.\n   c) Responsibilist good: manifesting intellectual virtues like conscientiousness.\n\nConscious awareness strengthens (b) and often (c). Therefore beliefs held on unconscious grounds can be justified (a), but less than ideal along (b) and (c). This layered view accommodates both intuitions: the justificatory standing of automatic beliefs and the special value of reflective endorsement.\n\nV. Conclusion\n\nWe began with the claim that for a mental state to be epistemically based on reasons, the subject must be consciously aware of those reasons. Examination of phenomenology, responsibility considerations, and regress arguments weakens the motivation for that claim. A functional, empirically informed account of basing shows how epistemic links can be forged sub-personally: what matters is sensitivity, proper functioning, and integration\u2014hallmarks of cognition that need not surface in awareness.\n\nThus, lack of conscious awareness of one\u2019s reasons does not, by itself, preclude a mental state from being epistemically based on those reasons. Reflective accessibility remains epistemically valuable, but it is not constitutive of justification. The epistemic landscape is populated by a rich array of justified beliefs whose trajectories are charted beneath the waters of consciousness\u2014an important datum for philosophers as they calibrate normative theories to the actual architecture of the mind.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 2, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 2560, "reasoning_tokens": 128}
{"question_id": "Jenkin-EpistemicRoleCore-2020", "question": "Some philosophers argue that in order for a mental state to be based on epistemic reasons (and thereby have an epistemic status as justified or unjustified), the subject must be consciously aware of those reasons. This poses a challenge for views that hold that modular, automatic cognitive processes can involve genuine epistemic basing. Does lack of conscious awareness of one's reasons preclude a mental state from being epistemically based on those reasons?", "answer": "1. Introduction  \n\nTo know, or even justifiably to believe, seems to require believing for good reasons.  A natural thought is that \u201cbelieving for reasons\u201d involves something the subject can cite, endorse, or at least survey in consciousness.  After all, epistemic appraisal is a mode of appraisal of persons; and appraisal of persons, it is said, presupposes their agential control, which in turn presupposes conscious access.  On this internalist picture, if a belief issues from a train of sub\u2010personal, automatic, or modular processing of which the subject is unaware, there is nothing for the subject to take as her reason.  The resulting belief may be reliably formed, but it is not properly based on reasons; hence it is not justified in the way paradigm rational beliefs are.\n\nOpposing this internalist line is a growing body of work that highlights the cognitive scientific fact that much of ordinary, incontrovertibly rational cognition is unconscious.  Think of causal\u2010explanatory inference in visual perception, syntactic parsing, probabilistic updating in ordinary conversation, or the integration of distributed cues under uncertainty.  If conscious access were required for genuine epistemic basing, it would follow that the lion\u2019s share of our commonsense knowledge is not rationally grounded\u2014an implausible conclusion.  The debate therefore turns on whether lack of conscious access really blocks a mental state\u2019s basing relation to reasons.  I shall argue that it does not.  Conscious awareness can facilitate epistemic responsibility, but it is not constitutive of the basing relation itself.  The argument proceeds in four stages:\n\n(1) Disentangling three different senses of \u201cawareness of reasons\u201d that often get conflated.  \n(2) Diagnosing the appeal of the Conscious Access Requirement (CAR) and showing why its central motivations can be preserved without the requirement.  \n(3) Developing a positive account of sub\u2010personal basing in terms of competence or reasons\u2010responsive dispositions that do not demand consciousness.  \n(4) Addressing the worry that abandoning CAR threatens the distinctively normative character of epistemic evaluation.\n\n2. Three senses of \u201cawareness of reasons\u201d\n\nDebates often shift uneasily among the following notions:\n\nA. Occurrent phenomenological awareness: the agent is currently introspectively conscious of a premise or piece of evidence while forming or sustaining the belief.\n\nB. Dispositional access: the agent could, on reflection, become aware of the premise and cite it in answer to \u201cWhy do you believe p?\u201d questions.\n\nC. Conceptual grasp: the agent possesses the requisite concepts to articulate the reason if prompted and enough cognitive wherewithal to appreciate its bearing on p.\n\nMany \u201caccess\u201d internalists intend B or C.  In everyday cases, they say, we can, at least in principle, reflect and retrieve the evidence on which our beliefs rest.  Critics reply that a large range of knowledge \u2014 say the distance of a looming object, the identity of a friend\u2019s face, or that this sentence is grammatical \u2014 is delivered by perceptual or linguistic modules from which B and C are absent.  The internalist shifts ground, retreating to the weaker C; but even C is often unmet, e.g. when an infant recognizes her mother\u2019s voice, or an untrained adult tracks subtle statistical regularities in a speaker\u2019s accent.  Since none of these beliefs seems epistemically \u201cbaseless,\u201d the burden of proof lies with the proponent of CAR to explain why the absence of conscious awareness deprives them of epistemic status.\n\n3. Why people find the Conscious Access Requirement attractive\n\ni. The deontic pull.  Epistemic justification is thought to be the sort of thing for which we are responsible and for which we can be blamed or criticised.  If one could not have done otherwise because one had no access to the supporting reasons, it seems unfair to blame.\n\nii. The transparency of reasons.  When we reflect on our own paradigm rational beliefs \u2014 say, accepting a mathematical proof \u2014 we experience stepping through explicit considerations.  This phenomenology tempts us to think it is constitutive of basing.\n\niii. Intuitive contrast cases.  Suppose my coffee tastes bitter and I catapult to the belief that global interest rates will rise.  Unbeknownst to me, there is a perfect covariance in my cognitive architecture mysteriously wiring \u201cbitter coffee taste\u201d to truths about macroeconomics.  Intuitively, the belief is not justified; yet it is causally produced by a reliable mechanism.  CAR seems to account for this: lacking awareness of the evidential bearing of coffee\u2010taste on interest rates, my belief is not epistemically based.\n\nThese considerations have force, but they underwrite at most a defeasible presumption, not a strict requirement.  The deontic pull, for example, shows that conscious access is one route to epistemic responsibility, not necessarily the only one; the phenomenology of explicit inference shows that some basing relations are conscious, not that all must be; and the contrast cases can be explained by appealing to the etiological notion of epistemic competence rather than access.  Let me elaborate.\n\n4. Competence without consciousness\n\nA bird\u2019s navigation system integrates sun position, magnetic cues, and optic flow to represent its location.  Were a conscious avatar in the loop, she could cite those cues as reasons.  The actual bird cannot.  Does it therefore navigate irrationally?  We should resist an inference from \u201ccan\u2019t cite\u201d to \u201cirrational.\u201d  The bird\u2019s system exemplifies a learned, counterfactual\u2010supporting competence: had the sun been elsewhere, it would have recalibrated; had the magnetic field been shielded, its performance would degrade.  Such counterfactual sensitivity is the hallmark of basing on reasons in the broad sense of responding to evidence \u2014 what John McDowell calls the \u201cspace of reasons,\u201d though one need not sign on to his requirements concerning conceptual capacities.\n\nHumans too possess sub\u2010personal competences underpinning rational belief.  The visual system extracts depth from binocular disparity; the auditory system localises sound through inter\u2010aural time difference; the language processor computes syntactic parses to secure semantic uptake.  In all these cases, there are enabling reasons: disparity values, phase shifts, phrase\u2010structure rules.  The subject is not aware of them as such, but her cognitive architecture is reliably sensitive to them in a way that is explainable by reference to their epistemic relevance.  The architecture \u201ctreats\u201d them as evidence.  This is sufficient, I submit, for the belief to be epistemically based, because the basing relation supervenes on the subject\u2019s competence, not on her phenomenology.\n\nA useful analogy is skilled action.  A pianist may execute a complex run by automatic motor routines; yet we still credit her with agential prowess.  She could stop, reflect, and reconstruct some of the harmonic reasons for playing those notes, but the performance\u2019s rationality does not depend on that reflective capacity in the moment.  Epistemic agency is similar: reflective oversight is a higher\u2010level ability that secures second\u2010order control, but first\u2010order competence can be in good epistemic order without it.\n\n5. The positive account: reasons\u2010responsive sub\u2010personal competence\n\nLet us formalise the notion.  A subject S\u2019s belief that p is epistemically based on reason R iff:\n\n(1) R is a genuine epistemic reason for p (e.g., renders p probable, explains p, entails p).  \n(2) S\u2019s cognitive system is set up so that R (or states that carry R\u2019s informational content) non\u2010deviantly causes S to believe p in a manner that is modally robust: across nearby worlds where R is absent, S would not form the belief, and across nearby worlds where stronger counter\u2010evidence appears, S would retract.  \n(3) The causal\u2010functional link in (2) is not epistemically accidental; it is sustained by a competence whose function is precisely to respond to considerations bearing on p\u2019s truth.  \n\nCondition (3) filters out the \u201cbitter coffee\u201d case: the bizarre covariance lacks the right teleology.  The wiring is not there in virtue of tracking p\u2019s truth, but due to a freakish accident; hence it fails to instantiate an epistemic competence.  By contrast, the depth module in vision evolved (and develops) to track distal layout; its sensitivity to disparity therefore possesses the right etiology.  Conscious access is absent in both cases, yet only the module satisfying (3) yields epistemic basing.\n\nThis competence account vindicates reliabilist insights while incorporating normativity: the function of the competence is epistemic, and failure counts as error.  It gives explanatory heft: why does the subject believe p?  Because her system registered R as indicating p.  It also preserves the deontic dimension, once we recognise that responsibility can be graded: we hold ordinary adults responsible to a higher degree than infants precisely because adults have reflective resources in addition to sub\u2010personal competences.\n\n6. Objections and replies\n\nObjection 1: Without conscious access the subject cannot give or withhold assent on the basis of reflection; therefore she lacks control and cannot be praised or blamed.  \n\nReply: Two points.  First, not all epistemic appraisal trades on blame.  Knowledge attribution in everyday contexts is often third\u2010personal: we say \u201cHe knows there is a cup on the table\u201d of an infant without envisaging reprimand.  Second, responsibility is scalar.  Even if full\u2010blooded doxastic responsibility demands potential reflective endorsement, minimal rationality, sufficient for justification, demands only that the belief be produced by a competence designed to track truth.  The infant is not criticisable but her belief is still epistemically good.\n\nObjection 2: The competence account collapses epistemic basing into reliable causation and cannot distinguish epistemic reasons from mere causes.  \n\nReply: Condition (3) precludes collapse.  A cause counts as a reason only if the competence treats it as such in virtue of its evidential bearing.  This explanatory constraint is more than statistical reliability.  Lots of mechanisms are reliable with respect to certain outputs, yet we would not say they base beliefs on reasons.  For instance, a tumor causing both headaches and a belief that one has a tumor is reliable across some slice of worlds, but the causal route does not instantiate a truth\u2010tracking design.  Modern process reliabilism (e.g., Peter Graham\u2019s proper\u2010function view) or virtue reliabilism (Ernest Sosa, John Greco) draws on this etiological element.\n\nObjection 3: The proposal severs the link between reasons and deliberation that lies at the heart of the normative perspective.  For the space of reasons is the space of that which can be cited in justifying one\u2019s attitude.\n\nReply: Citation is indeed one hallmark of reasons in the distinctively deliberative sphere, but epistemic appraisal is broader.  Consider factive emotional perception: I notice your anger by perceiving it in your face, not by explicit inference.  Yet \u201cHe is angry\u201d is manifest to me for the reason that his facial expression bears the anger.  If challenged, I could cite the expression after the fact; still, the original basing was immediate.  Similarly, perceptual belief involves a reason \u2014 the scene before my eyes.  That I could cite it is extraneous to the basing relation itself.  Normativity attaches because the scene\u2019s obtaining makes my belief fitting, not because I can mention it.\n\n7. Cognitive scientific support\n\nEmpirical evidence underlines the need to divorce basing from consciousness.\n\na. Split\u2010brain patients can form cross\u2010hemisphere inferences subconsciously.  The right hemisphere receives a picture of snow; the left hemisphere receives the word \u201cshovel.\u201d  Asked why she picked a shovel, the patient confabulates (\u201cBecause I need to clean the chicken coop\u201d), yet the selection is rational: a shovel removes snow.  The inference crosses the corpus callosum covertly.  If justification required awareness, we would have to say the patient\u2019s choice is groundless \u2014 counterintuitive given its obvious reason\u2010responsiveness.\n\nb. Bayesian cue integration in perception.  Subjects merge haptic and visual cues consistent with statistically optimal weighting.  They cannot articulate the computations, yet their perceptual estimates are rational in the sense of exploiting evidential relations to minimise error.  Denying justification here empties \u201cjustification\u201d of its contact with truth.\n\nc. Implicit learning of artificial grammars.  Participants classify strings at above\u2010chance rates after exposure, with no introspective access to the rules.  Arthur Reber argued decades ago that the learning is epistemic: it tracks the grammar\u2019s structure, not accidental correlates.  Participants base their judgments on reasons they cannot voice.\n\n8. Retaining a role for conscious reflection\n\nThough I reject CAR, I do not deny that consciousness matters.  It does so in at least three ways:\n\ni. Error correction.  When competences conflict, conscious reasoning arbitrates, integrating top\u2010down expectations with bottom\u2010up data.\n\nii. Higher\u2010order justification.  Sometimes we want to know not simply that p, but that we know that p.  Meta\u2010justification plausibly requires the ability to inspect one\u2019s grounds.\n\niii. Social communication.  Epistemic norms are coordinated through testimony, argument, and deliberation; conscious access enables us to exchange reasons publicly.\n\nThus a pluralist picture emerges: there are two layers of epistemic basing \u2014 sub\u2010personal competences that make up the bulk of everyday justification, and personal\u2010level reflective basing that undergirds our discursive practices.  Conscious access is essential for the second, optional for the first.\n\n9. Comparison with rival positions\n\nInternalism: traditional access internalism (e.g., Fumerton, BonJour) requires that justificatory grounds be cognitively accessible on pain of skeptical regress.  My view shares internalism\u2019s enthusiasm for reasons but externalises access: the architecture\u2019s sensitivity suffices.  This softens skepticism because much unconscious processing satisfies the requirement.\n\nPure reliabilism: Alvin Goldman\u2019s early reliabilism counts a belief as justified if produced by a reliable process type, regardless of reasons.  My view goes beyond reliabilism by making explicit reference to reasons \u2014 the contents tracked \u2014 not mere reliability.  A process that tracks the wrong variables (coffee taste) yet happens to be reliable fails (3).\n\nVirtue epistemology: Ernest Sosa distinguishes animal knowledge (apt belief from competence) from reflective knowledge.  The present account is broadly Sosa\u2010friendly, interpreting \u201ccompetence\u201d in epistemic terms.  The difference concerns whether consciously reflectively endorsing one\u2019s reasons is necessary for the first level; I say no, Sosa also says no.\n\nEvidentialism: Conee and Feldman hold that justification supervenes on one\u2019s evidence.  If evidence is understood as mental states present to consciousness, evidentialism lapses into CAR.  But evidentialism can be re\u2010interpreted in a wider way: evidence is constituted by information\u2010carrying states regardless of awareness.  My view thus reconciles evidentialism with cognitive science.\n\n10. Normativity preserved\n\nThe deepest worry is that in permitting unconscious basing, we reduce epistemic evaluation to the merely causal or biological.  But normativity can emerge from functional teleology supplemented by evaluative standards of truth.  A thermometer has the function of tracking temperature; it is assessable as functioning or malfunctioning.  Human epistemic competences have the function of tracking truth; they are assessable as justified or unjustified dependently on whether they fulfill that function in the circumstances.  Conscious endorsement is a special case of properly functioning truth\u2010directed processing, not its defining core.\n\nMoreover, allowing sub\u2010personal basing furnishes a principled story about how infants and non\u2010human animals can enjoy proto\u2010epistemic status, thereby situating human rationality within a naturalistic continuum rather than an inexplicable gulf.\n\n11. Conclusion\n\nLack of conscious awareness does not preclude a mental state from being epistemically based on reasons.  The basing relation is fundamentally a matter of competent sensitivity to the bearing of reasons on truth, not of the subject\u2019s occurrent or potential introspective access to them.  Conscious access is valuable for higher\u2010order reflection, social justification, and error correction, but it is not necessary for first\u2010order justification.  Recognising this allows epistemology to take seriously the deliverances of cognitive science: much reasoning is rapid, automatic, and opaque to introspection, yet manifestly rational.  To insist on conscious awareness as a precondition would generate an implausibly skeptical verdict on ordinary cognition and sever epistemic theory from empirical reality.  A competence\u2010based view preserves normativity while doing justice to the unconscious architecture that underwrites our everyday knowledge.\n\nWord count \u2248 2,120", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 3, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 3675, "reasoning_tokens": 128}

Does lack of conscious awareness of one's reasons preclude a mental state from being epistemically based on those reasons?", "answer": "1. Introduction: the puzzle about basing and awareness  \n\nSuppose I have the visual experience of a red apple on the table and unhesitatingly believe that there is a red apple before me. My perceptual system computed that belief automatically, without my explicitly thinking: \u201cI have a red, round-ish, apple-shaped visual array; things that look red and apple-shaped in normal lighting are apples; therefore, there is an apple.\u201d Intuitively, however, my belief is epistemically well-based. I formed it for excellent perceptual reasons, and if someone asked why I believe there is an apple, it would be appropriate to answer, \u201cBecause I see one.\u201d Yet at the moment of forming the belief I was not consciously aware of any such reason. Was the belief, then, really based on reasons in the normatively relevant sense?  \n\nMany philosophers\u2014especially those attracted to internalist or \u201caccess\u201d conceptions of justification\u2014hold that a mental state has epistemic standing only if its subject is (or at least can be) consciously aware of the grounds that render it justified. Others argue that this awareness requirement is too stringent: modular, automatic, sub-personal processes deliver the very paradigm cases of cognitively well-based states, and it would be a reductio of the requirement if it implied that nearly all perception, memory, or ordinary language comprehension is unjustified. The debate matters, because it bears on the nature of epistemic responsibility, on whether animals and pre-reflective children can have justified beliefs, and on whether contemporary cognitive science can illuminate rational inference without lapsing into mere causal description.  \n\nI shall argue that lack of occurrent conscious awareness does not preclude a mental state from being epistemically based on reasons. What matters is not whether the agent is explicitly entertaining the reasons but whether the belief is produced and sustained by a cognitive competence that is properly sensitive to truth-supporting considerations. Conscious access can enhance one\u2019s epistemic position\u2014e.g., by allowing reflective error-checking or deliberative self-critique\u2014but it is not a necessary condition for epistemic basing itself. I will defend this thesis in five steps: (i) spelling out the distinction between causal basing and epistemic basing; (ii) presenting the standard arguments for the awareness requirement; (iii) rebutting those arguments; (iv) articulating a competence-based account on which non-conscious sensitivity to reasons suffices; and (v) explaining how the view secures epistemic responsibility without collapsing into externalist insensitivity.  \n\n2. Causal basing vs. epistemic basing  \n\nBegin with the uncontroversial datum that some mental states are causally dependent on others: the visual experience causes the perceptual belief, memorial recollections cause expectations, and so on. Epistemic basing is a narrower relation: a belief is epistemically based on a reason R only if R figures in the correct kind of causal chain\u2014one that rationalizes the belief and puts it in good epistemic standing. A pathological doxastic process in which wishful thinking causes me to believe P only because believing P would be pleasant is causal but not epistemic in the relevant sense.  \n\nPhilosophers have proposed diverse conditions for epistemic basing\u2014counterfactual dependence on the truth of the reason, the involvement of a reliable mechanism, employment of an inference rule the agent endorses, etc. What unifies them is the idea that basing must not be merely causal but also normatively appropriate: the agent believes because of considerations that in fact support the truth of the belief. The disagreement about awareness is fundamentally about whether occurrent consciousness is part of what marks the causal relation as normatively appropriate.  \n\n3. Arguments for the awareness requirement  \n\nThree broad families of argument underwrite the requirement.  \n\na. The Transparency or Explanatory Argument.  \n\nJustification is supposed to be accessible to reflection: when one asks oneself \u201cWhy do I believe this?\u201d, one can normally cite the epistemic grounds. If the subject cannot in principle give an answer, the belief seems ungrounded and epistemically irresponsible.  \n\nb. The Responsible Agency Argument.  \n\nEpistemic justification is tied to responsibility, and responsibility presupposes control. Since we control only what we can deliberately guide, and deliberate guidance presupposes conscious appreciation of reasons, justified belief requires an awareness of those reasons.  \n\nc. The Distinctiveness Argument.  \n\nUnless we require consciousness, we cannot distinguish basing on epistemic grounds from mere reliable causation. A thermostat\u2019s belief-like state that the room is cold is reliably generated by changes in ambient temperature; without consciousness, the worry goes, my perceptual system could stand to my beliefs no differently from the thermostat\u2019s sensors to its internal states.  \n\n4. Critiquing the requirement  \n\nEach argument overgeneralizes.  \n\na. Transparency need not be perfect.  \n\nIt is true that we can often supply reasons on demand, but the ability to articulate a reason is neither universal nor infallible. Expert chess players execute moves on the basis of highly sophisticated pattern recognition they cannot fully verbalize. If the awareness requirement were strict, the grandmaster\u2019s move could not be epistemically justified, a consequence few would accept. A more plausible view is that when reflection is called for, we can often *reconstruct* partial grounds\u2014\u201cthe position looked dangerous on the queenside\u201d\u2014which is compatible with the actual basing occurring sub-personally.  \n\nb. Responsibility without continuous control.  \n\nWe routinely hold agents responsible for spontaneous emotions they do not consciously control (e.g., culpably nurtured prejudices) and for negligent failures to consider evidence. Responsibility concerns a standing capacity for *rational* control exercised over time, not moment-to-moment conscious supervision. If so, the mere absence of occurrent awareness when a belief is formed does not undermine responsibility, provided the agent possesses the general ability to monitor and correct beliefs if circumstances demand.  \n\nc. Distinctiveness can piggyback on functional competence.  \n\nThermostats are not thinkers because they lack the suite of cognitive competences characteristic of minds\u2014concept application, counterfactual reasoning, holistic updating, deliberative control, etc. These competences can be functionally characterized without invoking consciousness. By building a richer functional profile into epistemic basing, one preserves the normative difference between mere reliable causes and genuinely *rational* causes without appealing to awareness per se.  \n\n5. The competence-based alternative  \n\nThe foregoing critique suggests a positive proposal:  \n\nA mental state M is epistemically based on reason R for subject S if and only if  \n\n(i) R is a contentful mental state (an experience or representation) of S that supports the truth of M;  \n\n(ii) R causally sustains M through the operation of a cognitive competence C that is constitutively aimed at truth (i.e., its function is to track truth across normal conditions);  \n\n(iii) C is available to S for critical assessment and regulation, at least diachronically (over time), should S reflect.  \n\nConditions (ii) and (iii) draw on recent virtue epistemology, especially Ernest Sosa\u2019s distinction between *animal* and *reflective* knowledge. The idea is that competences confer justification at the \u201canimal\u201d level, while \u201creflective\u201d justification adds a higher-order perspective. Conscious awareness typically accompanies the latter but is not needed for the former.  \n\n6. Objections answered  \n\nObjection 1: \u201cChildren and animals.\u201d  \n\nThe awareness requirement implausibly entails that pre-linguistic children and non-human animals lack justified beliefs. Yet ethologists credit rat navigation or chimpanzee tool selection with genuine sensitivity to environmental affordances. A competence account vindicates these judgments: the rat\u2019s spatial memory system is functionally aimed at mapping its environment; so long as it functions properly, the rat\u2019s belief about food location is epistemically well-based, even if the rat cannot entertain the concept of a \u201creason.\u201d  \n\nObjection 2: \u201cInferential blindness.\u201d  \n\nPhilosophers such as Peter Carruthers worry that many ordinary inferences\u2014e.g., using linguistic clues to disambiguate pronouns\u2014occur unconsciously and hence cannot be rational. But on the competence view they are rational: the language parser is a competence designed to exploit syntactic and semantic cues. That S may be blind to the internal steps does not threaten epistemic status, for competence, not introspection, is what matters.  \n\nObjection 3: \u201cBad reliable but epistemically insulting cases.\u201d  \n\nImagine a drug that causes you to form mostly true beliefs by a brute causal route\u2014no sensitivity to reasons, just a lucky correlation. Because the process is reliable but not reason-sensitive, it fails clause (ii). Thus the competence criterion avoids collapsing into pure reliabilism.  \n\n7. The role of consciousness  \n\nDenying that awareness is necessary for basing does not deny that it is epistemically valuable. Conscious access:  \n\n\u2022 enables **diagnostic** scrutiny: one can notice defeaters (e.g., lighting conditions) and suspend judgment;  \n\n\u2022 allows **conceptual integration**: reflective awareness lets the agent integrate the belief with her broader worldview;  \n\n\u2022 grounds **full-fledged responsibility**: if one can reflect but refuses to, one is blameworthy in ways animals are not.  \n\nIn short, consciousness upgrades, but does not ground, the justificatory status of a belief.  \n\n8. Hybrid views and the fate of internalism  \n\nInternalists may reply that the competence account smuggles in accessibility via clause (iii): if competence is \u201cavailable\u201d for critical assessment, isn\u2019t that just awareness? The answer is no. Availability is modal, not actual. A subject who never in fact questions her visual system\u2019s deliverances may still *be able* to do so\u2014for example, by attending to alternative lighting. The ability is anchored in the subject\u2019s cluster of cognitive resources and need not be exercised at every juncture. This style of \u201cweak access internalism\u201d (James Pryor, Susanna Rinard, et al.) is enough to satisfy the internalist intuition that justification must in principle be within the subject\u2019s rational reach, while still permitting sub-personal basing.  \n\n9. Empirical support from cognitive science  \n\nVision science shows that representations of 3-D shape, color constancy, and object permanence are generated by specialized modules operating below the level of conscious awareness. Nevertheless, when experimental conditions are normal, those modules reliably track environmental truth and integrate with deliberative reasoning (e.g., reaching, verbal report). The competence account squares with these findings: sub-personal modules supply epistemic reasons because they encode information in a way that the wider cognitive system treats as evidentially potent. Contrast this with priming effects, where subliminal stimuli bias judgment without encoding genuine evidence. Priming lacks reason-sensitivity and so fails clause (ii).  \n\n10. Conclusion  \n\nConscious awareness of one\u2019s reasons is neither necessary nor sufficient for epistemic basing. Not necessary, because modular, automatic competences can base beliefs on genuine reasons even when the agent is unaware; not sufficient, because merely entertaining a reason while the belief is caused by wishful thinking leaves justification absent. What matters is that the belief arise from a competence designed to respond to truth-supporting considerations and that the agent be positioned, at least in principle, to monitor and regulate the competence\u2019s deliverances.  \n\nRecognizing this helps dissolve a false dilemma: either embrace an implausibly demanding form of access internalism or slide into irresponsible externalism. A competence-centered account honors the normative dimension of rationality while respecting empirical insights about the mind\u2019s architecture. We thus preserve the epistemic legitimacy of our everyday perceptual, memorial, and inferential practices without insisting that our reasons must always parade before the inner eye of consciousness.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 4, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 2868, "reasoning_tokens": 384}

The basing relation, therefore, is normative as well as psychological: it connects a person to her epistemic reasons in the way required for epistemic appraisal, so that a belief\u2019s justification can be said to derive from the subject\u2019s evidence rather than merely coincide with it. A widespread \u201caccess internalist\u201d intuition holds that such basing must be transparent to the thinker: only if the subject can consciously cite or otherwise be aware of her reasons can we truly say that her belief is based on them in the epistemically relevant sense. Automatic, modular, or sub-personal cognitive processes\u2014processes that churn outside the arena of conscious attention\u2014would at best supply causes of belief, not the normatively relevant reasons that confer justification.  \n\nIn the last two decades, however, work in philosophy of mind and cognitive science has rendered the access requirement suspect. Humans routinely perform sophisticated inferences (e.g., from syntactic cues in language comprehension, from facial micro-expressions in social cognition, from visual depth cues in navigation) without any articulate grasp of the information that guides them. If a ship\u2019s captain performs a complex maneuver thanks to tacit knowledge of hydrodynamics rather than explicit calculation, do we wish to deny that her decision is epistemically creditable? Or must we concede that automatic cognition can be genuinely reason-responsive\u2014and hence that conscious access is not required for epistemic basing?  \n\nBelow I develop a qualified negative answer to the question: lack of conscious awareness of one\u2019s reasons does not in principle preclude a mental state from being epistemically based on those reasons. I proceed in five stages. (i) I clarify the access requirement and its motivation. (ii) I argue that empirical and phenomenological data undermine a strong awareness condition. (iii) I address the worry that abandoning awareness threatens the normative dimension of justification. (iv) I sketch a \u201ccapacitarian\u201d model of basing that preserves normative import without appealing to conscious access. (v) I close by distinguishing two species of justification\u2014diachronic and synchronic\u2014that jointly explain why awareness sometimes matters but need not always. Throughout, I grant that some reflective access is necessary for certain higher-order epistemic aims (e.g., knowledge of one\u2019s justification) yet deny that such access is constitutive of justification itself.\n\n2. The access internalist intuition  \n\nInternalists characteristically maintain that justification supervenes on factors internal to the subject\u2019s perspective. Access internalists add that the relevant factors must be accessible on reflection. Here \u201caccess\u201d typically means more than mere dispositional availability; it is taken to be occurrent or potentially occurrent awareness: if S is justified in believing that p, then S could, by attending, come to know what her justificatory basis is. Since epistemic justification is supposed to be an evaluable status at the \u201cpersonal level\u201d, and since only consciously accessible mental states are personal-level states, access internalists conclude that unconscious processes cannot do justificatory work.  \n\nThis view draws strength from a responsibility analogy: just as moral praise or blame requires that the agent could recognize and respond to moral reasons, epistemic evaluation (positive or negative) requires recognitional capacity with respect to evidential reasons. If a belief is formed by a sub-personal mechanism to which the agent has no introspective access\u2014say, a purely hard-wired association between red fruits and edibility\u2014how could the agent be creditable or blameworthy from the epistemic point of view?  \n\n3. Empirical counterevidence  \n\nConsider cases in which we happily ascribe justified belief while the subject is ignorant of the inferential path:  \n\na. Perceptual constancy. I look at a tilted coin and perceive it as round rather than elliptical. My visual system \u201ccalculates\u201d the shape from complex retinal input and prior constraints about lighting and geometry. I am utterly unaware of these computations, yet the perceptual belief that \u201cthe coin is round\u201d is paradigmatically justified\u2014indeed, knowledge-yielding.  \n\nb. Linguistic comprehension. When I read \u201cFew linguists swim\u201d, I effortlessly understand that most people who swim are not linguists, despite having no conscious access to quantifier-scope disambiguation rules. The semantic interpretation is the output of an automatic parser; nonetheless, my resulting belief about linguists\u2019 aquatic habits is justified by the sentence I encountered.  \n\nc. Expert judgment. Chess grandmasters often \u201cjust see\u201d that a given position is hopeless. Their recognition is the upshot of years of tacit pattern learning, not of conscious deliberation. But we do not demote their evaluations to lucky hunches; we credit them with epist\u00e9m\u00e8 grounded in reliable sensitivity to the board\u2019s objective structure.  \n\nd. Kalman filter inference. A pilot\u2019s onboard computer integrates noisy radar signals into a single estimate of another aircraft\u2019s trajectory. The pilot trusts the readout. Although the algorithm is opaque to her, the belief that the approaching jet is at 14,000 feet is based on good evidence, transmitted via dependable instrumentation.  \n\nThese examples pressure the claim that conscious accessibility is necessary for epistemic basing. The relevant processes are reason-responsive, discriminating truth from error in ways that track evidential relations; the resulting beliefs inherit that normative pedigree even when the agent lacks introspective access.  \n\n4. Does normativity disappear without awareness?  \n\nThe access internalist will respond: appearances notwithstanding, the beliefs above are justified only because the subject could in principle bring the justificatory chain to awareness. For instance, I could note that \u201cmy visual experience as of a round coin counts as evidence of roundness\u201d, or the grandmaster could articulate heuristics if prompted. Absent this ability, the internalist claims, the putative reasons would be merely causal factors.  \n\nYet two problems afflict this defense. First, the \u201ccould in principle\u201d clause threatens to collapse into externalism. Given some idealized reflection, any normal subject could perhaps cite something\u2014\u201cit looks round\u201d, \u201cthe sentence says so\u201d, etc.\u2014but appeal to that generic accessibility does not secure the specific evidential linkage. Second, developmental psychology shows that young children and some cognitively impaired adults possess justified perceptual beliefs despite lacking the metacognitive resources to cite experiences as reasons. If the access condition were strict, these populations would rarely achieve justification, an implausible result.  \n\nMoreover, normativity need not ride piggyback on conscious recognition. In moral theory, philosophers such as Susan Wolf and John Fischer argue that deep control or \u201creasons-responsiveness\u201d suffices for moral responsibility even when the agent is unaware of many contributing factors. Analogously, epistemic credit may derive from the reliability and sensitivity of the faculties that give rise to belief, not from the agent\u2019s ability to rehearse those factors verbally.  \n\n5. A capacitarian model of basing  \n\nLet me outline an alternative. Call it Capacitarian Basing (CB):  \n\nCB A mental state M of subject S is epistemically based on reason R if and only if  \n(i) R non-deviantly causes M through a cognitive capacity C that is functions-properly aimed at truth,  \n(ii) C is available for personal-level regulation (e.g., via endorsement, rejection, or uptake) across normal contexts, and  \n(iii) S\u2019s broader cognitive architecture manifests a general competence to align belief with truth-conducive reasons.  \n\nClause (i) grounds epistemic status in the constitutive aim of the sub-personal faculty; clause (ii) incorporates a modest accessibility requirement\u2014not to the reasons themselves, but to the outputs of the capacity, which S can accept or contest; clause (iii) ensures that the attribution of basing is sensitive to the agent\u2019s overall rational profile.  \n\nOn CB, perceptual belief is justified because visual modules are truth-oriented (given normal environment), their outputs are subject to higher-level endorsement (I can check whether what I see coheres with other beliefs), and my cognitive system typically integrates visual reasons properly. Conscious awareness of the low-level reasons is unnecessary; the availability of the output suffices for epistemic responsibility.  \n\n6. Reply to objections  \n\nObjection 1: Without conscious access, the subject cannot distinguish good from bad reasons and is epistemically passive.  \n\nReply: Capacitarian basing grants that reflective assessment is possible at the level of outputs. If a belief appears funny or conflicts with other beliefs, the subject can query it, initiate further inquiry, or suspend judgment. This second-order regulation is what anchors rational agency, not introspection into sub-personal computations.  \n\nObjection 2: CB collapses into process reliabilism and thereby forfeits the specifically reason-responsive dimension of justification.  \n\nReply: CB differs from brute reliabilism because it retains condition (ii). The outputs of the reliable process must be situated within the personal deliberative space where reasons can interact. A belief formed in an encapsulated module that bypasses all personal-level control (e.g., an indiscriminately implanted intuition) would fail clause (ii) and hence lack justification even if reliable.  \n\nObjection 3: The view cannot explain cases where epistemic blame seems appropriate precisely because someone ignored reasons they were aware of\u2014e.g., wishful thinkers.  \n\nReply: Awareness can heighten responsibility by making negligence more culpable, but its absence does not annihilate responsibility altogether. A driver may be blameworthy for causing an accident by unconsciously failing to check the mirror if doing so falls within the domain of skills he is competent to exercise. Analogously, a believer may be blameworthy for ignoring counter-evidence processed unconsciously by faculties that normally warn her (e.g., conflict-monitoring). Degree of blame scales with degree of conscious salience, but the normative linkage persists below awareness.  \n\n7. Diachronic versus synchronic justification  \n\nOne reason the debate persists is that \u201cjustification\u201d is ambiguous between a synchronic status (how well-founded one\u2019s belief is at a time) and a diachronic status (how well one has managed one\u2019s cognitive life over an interval). Access to reasons plays a larger role in the diachronic dimension because reflection, critical scrutiny, and revision require some explicit handling of reasons. Yet synchronic justification can be secured by dependable capacities operating automatically.  \n\nImagine a scientist who calibrates her spectrometer, sets up the experiment, and weeks later glances at the dial to read the result. At the moment of reading, she does not rehearse why the instrument is trustworthy; nonetheless, her belief about the chemical\u2019s wavelength is justified (synchronic). Over longer periods, her justification depends on having suitably reflected on instrument reliability and corrected for possible errors (diachronic). Thus awareness matters in maintaining and improving evidential connections over time, but is not a standing requirement at every moment a belief is held.  \n\n8. Knowledge, basing, and defeat  \n\nWhat about cases of epistemic defeat? Suppose I have an unnoticed defeater\u2014say, I ingest a drug that makes my color vision unreliable. If awareness is not required for justification, do I remain justified under the drug? Many externalists would say no: the reliability condition is violated. CB reaches a similar verdict because clause (i) is defeated: the visual capacity is not functioning properly in the new context. Notably, awareness of the defeater could salvage justification only by enabling supplementary reasons, e.g., knowledge of the drug\u2019s effect combined with independent test results; the original perceptual belief alone loses standing. Thus the role of awareness is indirect, acting through higher-order corrective mechanisms rather than constituting basing tout court.  \n\n9. Varieties of awareness  \n\nFinally, not all awareness is introspective or discursive. Cognitive science distinguishes:  \n\n\u2022 Access consciousness: information available for reasoning and control.  \n\u2022 Phenomenal consciousness: what-it-is-like aspects of experience.  \n\u2022 Meta-awareness: explicit representation of one\u2019s own mental states.  \n\nThe strong internalist typically demands meta-awareness. Yet many epistemically creditable processes furnish access consciousness without meta-awareness: the content \u201ccoin is round\u201d is poised to guide action and inference even though I cannot articulate the sub-personal rationale. Recognizing this layered structure deflates the claim that basing requires conscious citation of reasons; it only requires that the evidential content be accessible for use, a markedly weaker condition.  \n\n10. Conclusion  \n\nThe guiding intuition behind the awareness requirement is laudable: epistemic evaluation should respect the subject\u2019s standpoint. But conflating standpoint with occurrent or even dispositional metacognitive access overlooks how human cognition actually realizes rationality. Perception, language comprehension, expert skill, and instrument reading illustrate that justification often flows through channels opaque to introspection yet integrated into the agent\u2019s deliberative architecture. A capacitarian model captures this middle ground: beliefs are epistemically based on reasons when they are produced by properly functioning truth-aimed capacities whose outputs are available for personal-level regulation. Conscious awareness strengthens and refines justification in many contexts\u2014especially diachronically\u2014but it is not a prerequisite for the basing relation itself. Therefore, lack of conscious awareness does not in general preclude a mental state from being epistemically based on epistemic reasons; rather, what matters is the agent\u2019s broader competence to respond to reasons, a competence that can be exercised sub-personally as well as reflectively.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 5, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 2935, "reasoning_tokens": 128}
{"question_id": "Jenkin-EpistemicRoleCore-2020", "question": "Some philosophers argue that in order for a mental state to be based on epistemic reasons (and thereby have an epistemic status as justified or unjustified), the subject must be consciously aware of those reasons. This poses a challenge for views that hold that modular, automatic cognitive processes can involve genuine epistemic basing. Does lack of conscious awareness of one's reasons preclude a mental state from being epistemically based on those reasons?", "answer": "                           Does Lack of Conscious Awareness Defeat Epistemic Basing?\n\n1. Framing the Debate  \n\nA central task of epistemology is to explain how a subject\u2019s mental states come to possess positive or negative epistemic status\u2014how they become justified, unjustified, warranted, or unwarranted. One influential idea, captured by the slogan \u201creasons-first epistemology,\u201d holds that a belief is justified when it is appropriately based on the subject\u2019s epistemic reasons. A second idea\u2014call it the \u201cconscious awareness requirement\u201d\u2014adds that basing, to earn the label \u201cepistemic,\u201d must be mediated by the subject\u2019s conscious grasp of those reasons. On this view, if the reasons that causally give rise to a belief never rise to the level of personal-level awareness, the resultant belief cannot be epistemically justified (or unjustified) in virtue of them.  \n\nThe requirement looks congenial to traditional access-internalist pictures of justification, but it immediately clashes with a wide range of empirical findings in cognitive science: automatic facial-recognition modules, implicit statistical learning, lexical priming, Bayesian perceptual inference, and other \u201cfast, frugal\u201d or modular systems operate with remarkable epistemic success while eluding direct introspective access. If a radiologist\u2019s visual system nonconsciously extracts high-level features and thereby issues the judgment \u201ctumor present,\u201d does the lack of conscious access to the subpersonal inferences automatically render the judgment epistemically baseless? The question has practical as well as theoretical urgency, for it bears on how we should evaluate expert testimony, perceptual knowledge, and machine-learning analogues.  \n\nMy aim is to argue, first, that conscious awareness is not generally required for a mental state to be epistemically based on reasons; second, that acknowledging non-conscious basing does not collapse the normative distinction between justified and unjustified belief; and third, that a nuanced picture emerges in which different varieties of epistemic assessment track different kinds of access. The path to these conclusions proceeds in five stages: (i) clarifying what \u201cbeing based on reasons\u201d amounts to, (ii) isolating the motivations for the awareness requirement, (iii) examining empirical counter-examples, (iv) developing an alternative account of non-conscious basing, and (v) answering lingering objections.  \n\n2. What Is It to Be \u201cBased on Reasons\u201d?  \n\nDiscussions of the basing relation often founder on an equivocation between two senses of \u201creason.\u201d Propositional reasons are the facts that favour believing a proposition (the evidence). Doxastic reasons are the mental states via which the subject actually bases her belief. An ideally rational agent has matching pairs: she believes p because she mentally represents the proposition q and q is true and supports p. Real-world agents, however, often have only hazy or partial representation of their supporting evidence.  \n\nSimilarly, \u201cbasing\u201d itself comes in at least two flavours. Causal-functional basing sees the relation as a suitable causal process: S\u2019s belief that p is epistemically based on reason R just in case R non-deviantly causes S to believe p. Explanatory basing folds in an aim requirement: the cause must operate qua reason, that is, in virtue of its rationally supportive features. And a further subdivision distinguishes personal-level from subpersonal causation: did the reason causally impact S\u2019s own deliberation, or did it only influence a modular subsystem?  \n\nWe should resist the temptation to build conscious accessibility into basing by conceptual fiat. One can stipulate \u201cbeing consciously taken as a reason\u201d as the correct account, but then the awareness requirement wins by definition rather than argument. A more informative strategy is to see whether there are theoretical reasons for thinking that personal-level awareness plays a constitutive role in epistemic evaluation.  \n\n3. Motives for the Awareness Requirement  \n\nThree motivations dominate the literature.  \n\na. Guidance and Responsibility. Epistemic norms resemble moral norms: they apply to us as agents capable of reflecting on and revising our attitudes. Responsibility seems to require awareness: one can hardly be blameworthy for violating a norm one had literally no access to.  \n\nb. The Bad Basing Problem. Suppose a believer\u2019s attitude is in fact caused by a piece of evidence, but she would have formed that same belief even if the evidence had been radically different (e.g., because she\u2019s subject to wishful thinking). Without awareness, the evidential cause might be merely accidental. Conscious takings appear to ensure non-accidentality.  \n\nc. The Idea of Reasons as the \u201cRight Kind\u201d of Causes. Epistemic reasons, unlike gustatory or prudential causes, are supposed to justify. Phenomenologists (e.g., McDowell, Audi) emphasise a distinctive \u201cappearing-true\u201d phenomenology that accompanies conscious appreciation of reasons, marking them as normative.  \n\nEach line of thought has force, but each admits of challenges once we attend to real-world cognition.  \n\n4. Empirical Counter-Cases  \n\n4.1 Implicit Inference in Perception. Perceptual psychologists routinely model vision as probabilistic inference from sensory input to distal causes. When you see a red tomato, your brain integrates information about wavelength distributions, lighting conditions, depth cues, and prior probabilities. Most of this occurs in cortical areas to which you lack introspective access. Yet the resulting perceptual belief (\u201cthere\u2019s a red tomato\u201d) is paradigmatically justified. To deny that it is based on the brain\u2019s reasons\u2014light of wavelength \u03bb reflected from the object, etc.\u2014seems metaphysically extravagant.  \n\n4.2 Expert Pattern Recognition. Consider \u201cchicken-sexers,\u201d wine tasters, or chess grandmasters. Through prolonged exposure they acquire an ability to classify tokens with impressive reliability and speed, long before they can articulate the cues they use. Gary Klein\u2019s firefighters decide whether to abandon a burning building by running mental simulations that remain beneath consciousness. If the awareness requirement were correct, we would have to say that the expert\u2019s judgment is unjustified\u2014or at best accidentally correct\u2014until she introspectively discerns the underlying reasons. That is counter-intuitive and contrary to our practice of crediting expertise.  \n\n4.3 Everyday Automaticity. Ordinary language comprehension involves syntactic parsing, disambiguation, and pragmatic enrichment, none of which is phenomenally accessible in detail. But we still regard the resulting beliefs as epistemically warranted, assuming the linguistic environment is co-operative.  \n\nIn each domain, lack of conscious access does not seem to strip the belief of its epistemic pedigree. What these cases suggest is that basing can be subpersonal yet still normatively relevant.  \n\n5. A Non-Conscious Basing Account  \n\nHow might one reconcile non-conscious basing with normative epistemology? A promising strategy generalises ideas from reliabilism while preserving a role for reasons.  \n\n5.1 The Reliable-Reasoning Hybrid.  \n\n(i) Basing condition: S\u2019s belief that p is epistemically based on R if (a) R (a propositional content or informational state) causally sustains S\u2019s belief via a process that embodies the rational connection between R and p, and (b) the process is reliably sensitive to the rational relevance of R.  \n\n(ii) Justification condition: S\u2019s belief is prima facie justified if it is based (in the above sense) on a set of true rationally-supportive propositions.  \n\nOn this view, conscious awareness is sufficient but not necessary for (a) and (b). When the agent is aware that R obtains and infers p, the condition is obviously met. But when a visual module executes Bayesian updating, the internal mapping embodies the same rational support: likelihood ratios trigger posterior probability estimates. Reliability ensures that accidental correlations are weeded out.  \n\n5.2 Personal-Level Ownership. To meet the \u201cresponsibility\u201d objection, we add an ownership constraint: although the inferential steps can be subpersonal, the resulting belief must be integrated into the agent\u2019s personal-level economy in a way sensitive to higher-order correction. That is, if S acquires defeaters or learns that the process is generally unreliable in the present context, she is required (on pain of epistemic blame) to revise or withhold the belief. Ownership, not initial awareness, secures the agent\u2019s normative standing.  \n\n5.3 Functional Accessibility vs. Phenomenal Awareness. Instead of requiring \u201caccessibility on demand\u201d in the sense of immediate introspection, we can require functional accessibility: the informational basis is stored in such a way that it can, with effort or under prompting, be brought to consciousness or at least to explicit representation. Many modular outputs satisfy this. Experts often learn to articulate their implicit criteria when they undertake reflective training. Even when articulation fails, post-hoc testing can reveal sensitivity to the relevant evidence, supplying confirmation that the belief was produced for the right epistemic reasons.  \n\n6. Objections and Replies  \n\nObjection 1: The Explanatory Gap. How can subpersonal events be \u201creasons\u201d rather than bare causes if the agent does not treat them as such? Reply: The distinction between reason and cause is normative, but normativity can be grounded in role rather than phenomenology. A cause counts as a reason when its causal operation maps onto the logical support relation in the relevant environment. An inference engine that encodes Bayes\u2019 Rule treats likelihood ratios as weightier than mere salience, even if the agent is oblivious to the code.  \n\nObjection 2: No Epistemic Credit Without Awareness. Credit theories insist that knowledge requires cognitive agency not mere happenstance; automatism seems to remove agency. Reply: Agency admits degrees. The agent trains or maintains the relevant module, keeps herself in a conducive environment, and stands ready to heed error signals. That suffices for partial credit. Moreover, attributability does not require transparent deliberation; otherwise we would deny knowledge of perceptual basics to young children or animals.  \n\nObjection 3: The Swamping Problem. If reliability alone suffices, why not dispense with reasons altogether? Reply: The hybrid proposal preserves reasons at the explanatory level: what mediates reliability is the implicit tracking of evidence. A purely brute reliable process (say, a clairvoyant faculty) lacks that evidential mediation; it would fail condition (a), because the causal path would not embody the rational connection between input and output. The difference between a clairvoyant and a chicken-sexer is precisely that the latter\u2019s process covaries with reasons in virtue of discriminating features that are evidence, whereas the clairvoyant\u2019s faculty is a black box.  \n\nObjection 4: The Diachronic Challenge. Suppose S cannot, even in principle, access or reconstruct the subpersonal grounds. Then S cannot defend the belief under critical scrutiny, and so lacks second-order justification. Reply: This reveals a distinction between basic and reflective justification. Basic justification attaches at the time the belief is formed. Reflective justification concerns how S responds to challenges. A belief can be basically justified yet vulnerable to reflective defeat. The framework accommodates this: expert snap-judgments are basically justified; but if S is later pressed for reasons and cannot supply any, rational humility may require suspension.  \n\n7. Varieties of Epistemic Assessment  \n\nZooming out, we can systematise different normative statuses:  \n\n1. Basic (first-order) justification: grounded in non-deviant, reliability-plus-rational-tracking processes, independent of awareness.  \n2. Reflective entitlement: requiring that the agent can, upon reflection, reconstruct or locate the basis.  \n3. Responsibility or blameworthiness: governed by whether the agent is disposed to heed defeaters and to monitor her cognitive capacities.  \n\nConscious awareness is crucial for (2) and (3), but not for (1). Since a belief\u2019s status as \u201cepistemically justified\u201d often targets basic justification, lack of awareness need not preclude epistemic basing.  \n\n8. Conciliatory Notes and Residual Limits  \n\nThe conclusion so far vindicates non-conscious basing, yet it would be rash to claim that awareness is never required. Three residual roles remain:  \n\na. High-Level Theoretical Reasoning. Complex, multi-premise deductions, policy decisions, and conceptual analyses often exceed the capacity of subpersonal modules; conscious deliberation is indispensable.  \n\nb. Epistemic Self-Improvement. Reflective access allows agents to diagnose systematic biases, recalibrate heuristics, and share reasons with others\u2014important for the social dimension of epistemic norms.  \n\nc. Defeater Management. While initial formation can be unconscious, later confrontation with counter-evidence frequently demands conscious engagement.  \n\nThus the best position is pluralist: awareness is not necessary for initial basing, but it is instrumentally and normatively valuable for the ongoing governance of belief.  \n\n9. Conclusion  \n\nDoes lack of conscious awareness of one\u2019s reasons preclude a mental state from being epistemically based on those reasons? The answer is No. Empirical evidence and theoretical considerations jointly show that subpersonal processes can instantiate the basing relation in a manner sufficient for basic justification. The motivations behind the awareness requirement\u2014guidance, non-accidentality, normativity\u2014can all be met by appealing to reliable, rationally-sensitive processes and by linking personal-level responsibility to higher-order correction rather than to initial awareness. Conscious access remains significant for other epistemic goods (reflective assurance, communal transmission, self-regulation), but it is not a prerequisite for basing itself. Accordingly, modular, automatic cognition can play an authentic epistemic role, and epistemology must make room for the pervasive, subterranean intelligence of the mind.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 6, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 3170, "reasoning_tokens": 320}

One of the most vexed issues about basing is whether the subject must be consciously aware of her reasons for the resulting belief to be justified. The view that some form of consciousness is required has illustrious defenders\u2014Roderick Chisholm, Laurence BonJour, Richard Feldman and Earl Conee all defend versions of access internalism under which a subject\u2019s justification depends on what she is \u201cinternally\u201d in a position to know or grasp on reflection. But their stance sits uneasily with a picture of the mind that attributes much ordinary and scientific cognition to modular, automatic, and frequently unconscious processes. If, as cognitive science suggests, a large fraction of our perception, language\u2010processing, and even ordinary inference is accomplished subpersonally, then it looks as if consciousness is at best sporadic and often epiphenomenal; yet in those very episodes the resulting beliefs seem justified or unjustified in recognisably epistemic ways. The core question, therefore, is whether lack of conscious awareness of one\u2019s reasons precludes a mental state from being epistemically based on those reasons. I shall argue that it does not. Conscious awareness has an important but non-basic role to play: it can enhance the quality of basing by enabling second-order assessment, but epistemic basing itself\u2014understood as the relation that turns available reasons into the grounds of belief\u2014can occur wholly subpersonally and unconsciously. I first clarify the dialectic, then examine four arguments offered for the consciousness requirement; finally I advance a positive picture of subpersonal basing, defend it against two pressing objections, and end with an account of why conscious reflection, though dispensable for basing, remains epistemically valuable.\n\n1. Clarifying the dialectic\n\nCall the Consciousness Requirement (CR): Necessarily, if S\u2019s belief that p is justified by reasons R, S is (or could be upon reflection without new experience) consciously aware of R. Its denial is AC (Anti-Consciousness): Some beliefs can be justified by reasons R even though S lacks the relevant conscious access.\n\nCR combines two theses: (i) conscious accessibility suffices for justification; (ii) conscious accessibility is necessary for basing. Only (ii) concerns us. Many externalists deny both, but one could accept (i) and reject (ii): awareness is sufficient but not necessary. To evaluate (ii) we need a clearer conception of basing. Every viable theory must secure two desiderata:\n\na. Causal condition: R must causally influence the formation or sustainment of the belief that p.\nb. Rational condition: The influence must be of the right kind\u2014roughly, a respect of the dependency that constitutes rational support.\n\nA pure causal theory satisfies (a) but not (b), since deviant causal chains can meet (a) without conveying justification. A pure psychologised reason\u2010relation risks collapsing (b) into (i), rendering subpersonal processes irrelevant. The challenge is to hold on to both.\n\n2. Four arguments for a consciousness requirement\n\n2.1 The responsibility argument\nEpistemic justification plausibly grounds epistemic responsibility: we criticise an agent for believing irresponsibly when she declines to heed counterevidence or forgoes grounds available to her. Responsibility, the argument continues, presupposes control, and control in turn demands conscious awareness of what one is doing. Therefore justified beliefs must spring from reasons the agent can consciously recognise.\n\nThis argument conflates two notions of responsibility. There is accountability responsibility\u2014our practice of blaming, praising, demanding reasons\u2014which indeed presupposes the capacity to give reasons on demand. But there is also attributability responsibility: the sense in which a belief expresses the subject\u2019s epistemic character and is assessable as epistemically good or bad even if the agent cannot offer a defence. Suppose I form a belief that a car is red based on ordinary colour vision; when later challenged under unusual bluish lighting, I am initially at a loss to explain why I believed the car red, yet the belief was perfectly in order. I may acquire accountability later by reflecting on colour constancy, but my lack of initial awareness does not undermine the attributability of justification. Responsibility at this more basic level does not require contemporaneous awareness; it requires only that the belief flows from epistemically reliable and reasons-responsive mechanisms that are part of the agent.\n\n2.2 The regress argument\nIf unconscious reasons could justify, one might press: what justifies the subject in relying on those reasons? If the subject is not aware of them, she cannot be justified in taking them to be good; hence either a vicious regress or an explanatory gap. Conscious awareness purportedly halts the regress: once S \u201csees\u201d that her premises support the conclusion, no further story is needed.\n\nBut the regress here is illusory. A basing relation is not a belief in reasons; it is a non-doxastic causal\u2010cum-rational relation. When you visually perceive a tomato, the retinal stimulation causes a perceptual representation which in turn causes the belief \u201cthere is a tomato.\u201d The justificatory work is performed by the reliability of the chain and by the fact that the perceptual state embeds information that tomatoes are present. No additional meta-justification is required. Conscious awareness of the percept might help one recognise that the percept is good evidence, yet the evidentiality is already there, contained in the informational content of the perceptual state. The regress ends at subpersonal informational links, not at conscious inspection.\n\n2.3 The phenomenological argument\nDiscerning reasons, some claim, has a characteristic feel: the \u201caha\u201d of seeing that p follows from q, or the seeming that one\u2019s sensory experience presents a table. Justification supervenes on such seemings; without them there is no \u201cfor-me-ness\u201d and hence no justificatory force for the subject.\n\nWhile epistemic seemings do furnish paradigm cases of conscious basing, their phenomenology is at best a contingent mark, not an essential feature. Consider blindsight patients who lack phenomenal vision in a blind field yet can reliably guess the presence of shapes. Are their guesses unjustified? If a normal perceiver\u2019s belief is justified by the same information stream, the mere absence of visual phenomenology in blindsight cannot by itself rob the information of its epistemic character\u2014unless we adopt an implausible phenomenalist chauvinism. Similar points apply to implicit statistical learning: one can detect a complex pattern without noticing how one does so, yet the pattern\u2019s presence is genuine evidence.\n\n2.4 The dialectical argument\nInternalists maintain that justification is essentially perspectival\u2014something the subject can appreciate. In epistemic debates we rely on the method of \u201cciting reasons,\u201d so any adequate theory must preserve the ordinary practice of asking people why they believe as they do. Thus conscious access is indispensable to the concept of a reason.\n\nThis argument confuses having a reason with citing a reason. The practice of asking for reasons is reparative: it serves to check whether a person\u2019s belief formed properly; it is not constitutive of basing itself. A competent agent can often supply proxy reasons ex post; yet even when she cannot, we do not automatically dismiss the belief. When the car mechanic says, \u201cI don\u2019t know\u2014I just hear the engine and can tell the timing belt is off,\u201d we grant some justification provided her track record is good. She cannot cite the acoustic regularities, but her auditory module has registered them subpersonally. The dialectical practice presupposes that such tacit reasons exist and are lawfully connected to beliefs, otherwise requesting verbal reasons would neither confirm nor undermine them.\n\n3. A positive model: Subpersonal reasons and teleological causation\n\nTo make AC plausible we need a positive picture that honours both causal and rational requirements. I sketch a teleofunctional model:\n\nStep 1: Information\u2010bearing states. Cognitive systems generate internal states that carry information about the environment. A perceptual representation R carries the information that p iff, under normal conditions of the system\u2019s proper functioning, R occurs only when p is true.\n\nStep 2: Functional mapping. The system has been selected\u2014by phylogeny, ontogeny, or learning\u2014to use R as a premise in producing belief that p (or some related proposition). This teleofunctional mapping endows the causal link with epistemic significance: the link exists for the purpose of tracking truth.\n\nStep 3: Basing. S\u2019s belief that p is based on reasons R when (i) the causal history of the belief token includes R in the etiology; (ii) R bears information that p; (iii) condition (ii) is the very teleofunction for which R is exploited by S\u2019s cognitive system. When these obtain, the belief is epistemically justified to the degree that the mapping is reliable and environment-congruent.\n\nConscious awareness need not enter, for the crucial work is done by information content and proper function. When awareness is present it can itself be an information\u2010bearing state, enhancing reliability via metacognitive monitoring; but it is not mandatory for basing.\n\n4. Defence against two objections\n\n4.1 The cognitive integration objection\nOne might grant that subpersonal information can guide behaviour, yet deny that it counts as the subject\u2019s reason. Reasons must be agentially integrated\u2014available for rational control, inference, and deliberation. Subpersonal modules are too encapsulated to satisfy agential integration, so their outputs are at most causes, not reasons.\n\nReply: Agential integration is not binary but graded. Visual information is initially processed in V1, then in higher areas, eventually delivering a conceptualised percept to working memory, which can figure in explicit reasoning. At each stage the information is more integrated; yet justification accrues already early on. When you glance at a bird and immediately believe it is a robin, the first milliseconds involve encapsulated processes, but the resulting belief is yours. The ownership of a cognitive event derives from the fact that it belongs to the coordinated information-processing architecture that embodies the subject\u2019s epistemic agency. Ownership does not require contemporaneous introspective access, only that the process be integrated into the standing disposition to revise beliefs in the light of further information. Modular outputs typically satisfy this disposition, as shown when new sensory evidence corrects the belief.\n\n4.2 The New Evil Demon variant\nImagine a subject in an evil demon world whose perceptual modules function normally but whose environment is systematically deceiving. Because proper function teleology is environment-relative, it appears her subpersonal reasons fail to be truth-conducive, yet intuitively her beliefs are still justified. Do we not need conscious awareness to salvage her justification?\n\nWe should decouple teleology from actual reliability and attach it instead to \u201cnormal functioning according to design plan,\u201d where the design plan is specified by evolutionary history or learning history, not by the current environment. The demon victim\u2019s modules still possess the function of truth tracking even though frustrated. What matters is that the cognitive system aims at truth; awareness adds nothing. Thus subpersonal basing survives demon scenarios.\n\n5. The epistemic value of consciousness\n\nAlthough the lack of conscious awareness does not preclude basing, consciousness plays important epistemic roles:\n\na. Error correction. Metacognitive access allows higher-order monitoring that can veto or revise first-order outputs. This reduces susceptibility to certain biases, thereby indirectly elevating justification.\n\nb. Communicative coordination. Conscious reasons can be shared, teaching others to track truth; this enhances group epistemics.\n\nc. Reflective extension. Complex symbolic reasoning requires working\u2010memory manipulation of explicit items; here conscious awareness is functionally indispensable, not for justification per se but for widening the range of justifiable beliefs.\n\nHence awareness is instrumentally but not constitutively tied to basing.\n\n6. Conclusion\n\nThe intuition that reasons must be consciously accessible derives from conflating our practices of asking for reasons with the metaphysics of possession of reasons. A closer look at perception, implicit inference, and automatic cognition reveals vast realms where agents enjoy epistemic standings without concurrent awareness of the grounds. A teleofunctional information-theoretic account secures the causal and rational dimensions of the basing relation while omitting a consciousness requirement. Conscious access strengthens and extends our epistemic repertoire, but its absence need not bar a belief from being properly based. Therefore, lack of conscious awareness does not preclude a mental state from being epistemically based on its reasons, though it may diminish the agent\u2019s capacity for higher-order appraisal and dialectical defence.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 7, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 2776, "reasoning_tokens": 128}

Introduction  \n\nPhilosophers working in epistemology and the philosophy of mind agree on at least one fundamental point: the difference between a lucky true belief and a justified true belief is that the latter is related to the subject\u2019s epistemic reasons in the right way.  The nature of that \u201cright way\u201d\u2014the basing relation\u2014has proved notoriously elusive.  Among the most entrenched proposals is the \u201cAwareness Principle\u201d:  \n\n      Awareness Principle.  A mental state S of a subject x is epistemically based on a reason r only if x is consciously aware of r (or of the fact that r is a good reason for S).  \n\nIf the principle is correct, then modular, automatic, or otherwise unconscious cognitive processes cannot by themselves confer epistemic justification; at most they provide the raw materials on which conscious, reflective reasoning operates.  Conversely, if unconscious basing is possible, then large swathes of human (and animal) information-processing\u2014perception, language comprehension, memory retrieval, statistical learning\u2014fall squarely within the \u201cspace of reasons.\u201d  \n\nMy aim in what follows is to assess whether lack of conscious awareness precludes epistemic basing.  I shall proceed in five stages.  (i) I clarify the target notions of \u2018reason\u2019 and \u2018basing.\u2019  (ii) I present the main argument for the Awareness Principle.  (iii) I raise three lines of challenge: from subpersonal cognition, from ordinary unreflective reasoning, and from normative adequacy.  (iv) I sketch a positive model\u2014\u201cThe Dual-Level Account\u201d\u2014that explains how unconscious basing can nonetheless be distinctively epistemic.  (v) I defend the model against two worries: deviant causation and the loss of personal-level rationality.  The conclusion is that conscious awareness is not necessary for epistemic basing, though it plays an important regulative role.\n\n2. Reasons, Motivations, and Basing  \n\nWe must distinguish among:  \n\na. Explanatory or motivating reasons: the considerations in light of which the subject forms or maintains her attitude.  \nb. Justifying reasons: the facts that make the attitude epistemically appropriate.  \nc. The basing relation: the relation that must obtain for the first kind of reasons to coincide with, or at least align with, the second.  \n\nA paradigm case: I see steam rising from the street and believe that it just rained.  The perception of steam is my explanatory reason; the fact that steam is evidence of recent precipitation is my justifying reason.  For the belief to be justified, the perception must not only cause the belief but do so in an epistemically proper way\u2014not via hypnosis, wishful thinking, or some way that bypasses my epistemic agency.  \n\nThe Awareness Principle is best understood as a claim about explanatory reasons: unless I am consciously aware of r, r cannot be the consideration \u201cin light of which\u201d I adopt S.  A status-tracking element is added: only if r is the right sort of reason (truth-conducive, undefeated, etc.) does S become justified.  In short, awareness is supposed to be a gatekeeper that prevents mere causal explanation from counting as epistemic basing.\n\n3. The Case for Awareness  \n\nProponents of the Awareness Principle offer at least four intertwined considerations.\n\n3.1. Phenomenological Intuition  \n\nWhen I consciously deliberate\u2014\u201cIt is cloudy, so I should bring an umbrella\u201d\u2014the feel of actively endorsing the premise as my reason seems constitutive of rational belief-formation.  In the absence of any such phenomenology, the belief would seem unreasoned or, at best, a lucky hunch.\n\n3.2. Agential Control  \n\nEpistemic responsibility, on many accounts, requires that the believer exercise control over her cognitive attitudes.  Control, in turn, seems to demand awareness of what one is doing.  One cannot be blameworthy (or praiseworthy) for relying on considerations of which one has no inkling.\n\n3.3. Transparency of Justification  \n\nAn internalist dictum holds that whenever a subject is justified, she must have access\u2014via reflection\u2014to what justifies her.  Without access, there would be an in-principle gap between justification and the agent\u2019s perspective, violating the idea that justification is a perspective-dependent status.\n\n3.4. The Regress Worry  \n\nIf basing could occur unconsciously, how do we ensure it is not \u201cdeviant\u201d causation?  The easiest way, advocates say, is to require that the subject herself be able to cite the reason.  That gives us an explanatory stopping point.\n\nAlthough powerful, each of these lines of thought is contestable.  Let us examine three broad families of counterexamples and then draw some lessons.\n\n4. Three Challenges to the Awareness Principle  \n\n4.1. Subpersonal Cognitive Science  \n\nHuman vision is mediated by multiple encapsulated subsystems that convert proximal stimulation into richly articulated percepts.  I open my eyes and automatically form the belief \u201cThere is a red cup on the table.\u201d  The process is swift, involuntary, and (largely) inaccessible to consciousness.  Yet the belief is paradigmatically justified, and it is justified because it is based on the visual information delivered by those subsystems.  If awareness of each contributory representation were required, virtually no perceptual belief would be justified.\n\nOne might object that while we are unaware of the intermediate processing, we are aware of the visual appearance\u2014the cup\u2019s looking red\u2014and that appearance is our conscious reason.  But empirical work on change blindness and rapid-scene perception shows that we often fixate on a target without any stable phenomenology of color, shape, or location.  Still, the resulting beliefs are supported by reasons: retinal stimulation, feature detection, probabilistic inference, etc., none of which is consciously available.\n\n4.2. Ordinary Unreflective Reasoning  \n\nConsider a skilled chess player who, after a quick glance at the board, moves a bishop and later articulates, \u201cIt just felt like the right move.\u201d  Subsequent analysis reveals that the move blocks a discovered attack and sets up mate in three.  The player\u2019s choice was not blind luck; it was informed by tacit pattern-recognition acquired through thousands of prior games.  Here again, the justificatory basis is present\u2014structural features of the position\u2014yet conscious awareness is absent at the moment of decision.\n\nThe same holds for driving, speaking a native language, or diagnosing a familiar illness.  We rely on statistically grounded representations that rarely rise to the level of awareness.  To declare all such beliefs unjustified until we rehearse them in inner speech would flout common epistemic practice.\n\n4.3. Normative Adequacy and Epistemic Defeat  \n\nImagine a competent but lazy detective who receives excellent testimony that the suspect is innocent yet, without consciously thinking about the testimony\u2019s content, retains her belief in guilt.  Later she is challenged and becomes aware that the testimony defeats her earlier evidence.  Only then does she revise her view.  It seems right to say the detective\u2019s belief was unjustified after the defeating testimony arrived, even during the period when she lacked conscious awareness of it.  But if awareness were necessary for defeat as well as positive justification, we could not explain the loss of entitlement.  This suggests that epistemic statuses supervene on reason-relations that may outrun conscious access.\n\n5. A Dual-Level Account of Unconscious Basing  \n\nHow, then, can we preserve the intuition that justification is reason-dependent while allowing unconscious basing?  I propose the following model.\n\n5.1. Personal vs. Subpersonal Levels  \n\nCall mental states \u201cpersonal-level\u201d when they are attributable to the agent as such\u2014beliefs, desires, intentions\u2014and \u201csubpersonal\u201d when they belong to the information-processing subsystems posited by cognitive science.  Personal-level states need not be conscious (e.g., standing beliefs I\u2019m not thinking about), but they are available for rational control and report.  Subpersonal states typically are neither.\n\n5.2. The Basing Constraint  \n\nA personal-level belief B is epistemically based on reason r just in case:  \n\n(i) r is represented by some component of the subject\u2019s cognitive system;  \n(ii) the tokening of r non-deviantly causes B via a process that functions to track the truth relative to the relevant domain;  \n(iii) the process is part of the subject\u2019s overall epistemic agency, in the sense that it is integrated with other belief-forming mechanisms and subject to higher-level regulation (e.g., attention allocation, learning, error correction).  \n\nCondition (i) allows r to be personal-level or subpersonal; conscious awareness is optional.  Condition (ii) screens off deviant causal chains.  Condition (iii) grounds responsibility: although the agent may not be aware of r, she can in principle monitor, test, or recalibrate the system that produces B\u2014much as she can decide to wear her glasses or adjust the lighting to improve vision.\n\n5.3. Epistemic Justification  \n\nJustification accrues to B when its subpersonal basing process is (a) reliably truth-conducive in normal conditions and (b) not defeated by available information.  The defeat clause respects cases like the lazy detective: unheeded but registered testimony can undermine earlier warrant.\n\nThe Dual-Level Account thus honors the role of reasons while rejecting the claim that reasons must be occurrent in consciousness.\n\n6. Replies to Two Objections  \n\n6.1. Deviant Causation Revisited  \n\nSuppose a subject is hypnotized: the hypnotist utters \u201cThe sky is blue,\u201d which non-consciously triggers the subject to believe \u201cIt will rain tomorrow.\u201d  Condition (ii) is violated because the process does not function to track the truth of weather propositions; it is an accidental causal chain.  Hence the belief is not based on the utterance in the epistemic sense, even though it is causally dependent.  Conscious awareness is unnecessary; functional teleology does the work.\n\n6.2. Loss of Personal-Level Rationality  \n\nCritics worry that if subpersonal processing suffices, rationality is no longer the agent\u2019s achievement.  But notice: on the Dual-Level Account, epistemic agency involves controlling the conditions under which one\u2019s automatic modules operate, deciding whether to rely on them, and integrating their outputs with further reasoning.  A driver who turns on the cruise control is still accountable for reckless speeding; likewise, a believer who entrusts perception or memory remains epistemically responsible.\n\nMoreover, consciousness can still enhance rationality.  When the chess master later analyzes the position in slow motion, she may discover higher-order reasons that override her first impulse.  The theory does not deny value to reflective awareness; it denies only its necessity for every instance of basing.\n\n7. Weighing the Arguments  \n\nLet us return to the considerations adduced for the Awareness Principle.\n\n   Phenomenology: While the phenomenology of conscious inference is compelling, it is a guide to only a subset of justification.  Much of cognition lacks distinctive phenomenology yet is obviously epistemic.  \n\n   Agential Control: Control can be indirect, operating through adoption, maintenance, and revision of cognitive policies (e.g., trusting vision, distrusting gossip).  Indirect control suffices for responsibility in many domains (consider reliance on calculators or instruments).\n\n   Transparency: Internalism need not require presently conscious access; dispositional access, the ability to call reasons to mind if needed, is enough.  Vision satisfies dispositional access insofar as one can, by attending and reporting, make some justificatory features explicit.\n\n   Regress: The non-deviance and teleology conditions proposed above provide a principled stopping point without appealing to consciousness.\n\nHence the cumulative case for the Awareness Principle is undercut.\n\n8. Where Does That Leave Modularity?  \n\nFodor famously characterized modules as domain-specific, informationally encapsulated, and mandatory in operation.  On the Dual-Level Account, a module can supply epistemic reasons\u2014edge-detectors in the visual system deliver information about boundaries; the language module produces syntactic parses.  To the extent the modules are the product of evolution and individual learning aimed at veridical representation, their outputs qualify as prima facie justifiers.  Defeaters arise when the module\u2019s normal operating conditions are not met (e.g., poor lighting, ambiguous sentences), and higher-level monitoring can take this into account.\n\nThus modularism and reason-responsiveness coexist: modules generate reasons, higher cognition regulates their deployment.\n\n9. Broader Implications  \n\nThe debate touches on several other philosophical issues.\n\n   Animal and Infant Cognition: If consciousness were necessary for basing, non-linguistic creatures could never be justified, an implausible conclusion given the sophisticated perceptual discriminations and learning they exhibit.\n\n   Epistemic Defeat and Bias: Implicit biases sometimes distort the uptake of evidence despite being unconscious.  Recognizing these biases as epistemically significant (negatively) reinforces the idea that what happens below the surface of awareness matters.\n\n   Extended and Embodied Cognition: If justification can arise from processes that exceed conscious access, then the tools and environments we exploit may literally become part of our epistemic machinery.\n\n10. Conclusion  \n\nLack of conscious awareness does not in itself preclude a mental state from being epistemically based on reasons.  What matters is that the state be produced and sustained by truth-tracking processes integrated into the subject\u2019s cognitive architecture and open to rational regulation.  Conscious awareness is valuable: it enables higher-order evaluation, deliberate revision, and the articulation of reasons to others.  But it is not the sine qua non of epistemic basing.

Does lack of conscious awareness of one's reasons preclude a mental state from being epistemically based on those reasons?", "answer": "1. Introduction  \n\nPhilosophers who locate epistemic normativity in the space of reasons typically add a further thesis about the \u201cbasing relation\u201d: a belief, intention, perceptual judgment, or other cognitive state is epistemically justified only if it is based on the right reasons.  A natural\u2014and historically influential\u2014thought is that basing must be transparent to the subject: if your belief that p is epistemically well-grounded, you must be able to tell, by conscious reflection, what it is that speaks in favor of p.  This \u201cconscious access requirement\u201d (CAR) fits comfortably with Cartesian and classical empiricist pictures of the mind, on which the sort of items that can justify\u2014ideas, impressions, evident truths\u2014are themselves paradigmatically occurrent and consciously accessible.  In the last half-century, however, cognitive science has delivered a picture of the mind saturated with modular, automatic, and sub-personal information-processing routines.  Ordinary human reasoning is shot through with tacit inferences, probabilistic computations, and pattern recognitions that never rise to the level of introspective visibility.  The question is whether, in light of this, we should retain the CAR or conclude that a mental state can be epistemically based on considerations of which the subject is entirely unaware.\n\nI shall argue for a moderate negative answer: lack of occurrent conscious awareness does not in itself disqualify a mental state from being epistemically based on a reason; nevertheless, some form of reason-responsiveness that is, in principle, cognitively available to the subject is necessary for full-blown epistemic justification.  The argument proceeds in five steps.  (1) I distinguish three separable notions of awareness relevant to the issue.  (2) I review the main motivations for the CAR and show that each admits of a weaker formulation that does not entail occurrent consciousness.  (3) I then present three lines of empirical and conceptual evidence\u2014implicit perception, expert skill, and developmental reasoning\u2014that strongly suggest non-conscious basing.  (4) I outline a dispositional, functional account of the basing relation that accommodates these cases while preserving the normative core of reasons.  Finally, (5) I respond to three prominent objections, concerning epistemic responsibility, skeptic-proof access, and the alleged collapse into externalism.\n\n2. What Sort of \u2018Awareness\u2019 Is at Issue?  \n\nDiscussions of CAR often run together different gradations of access.  We need at least the following distinctions.\n\n   a. Occurrent phenomenal awareness: one is presently experiencing the reason\u2014e.g., a conscious visual appearance or a silent inner assertion.  \n\n   b. Reflective accessibility: even if the reason is not occurrent, one can, upon reflection, bring it to mind and articulate it, given normal cognitive resources.  \n\n   c. Rational sensitivity: one\u2019s cognitive system is disposed to form, sustain, revise, or withhold the belief in ways that track the reason, whether or not one could articulate this tracking.\n\nThe strong CAR equates epistemic basing with (a).  More moderate internalist views accept (b).  Externalist or virtue-epistemological views typically rest content with (c).  The controversy is thus not binary but triadic.  My target is the strong claim that absence of (a) is fatal to basing; I will remain open to, though critical of, the weaker claim that absence of (b) suffices.\n\n3. Why Think Basing Requires Occurrent Awareness?  \n\nThree main considerations motivate CAR.\n\n   i. The phenomenology of deliberation.  When we consciously weigh considerations\u2014e.g., evidence that it will rain\u2014we find ourselves reaching the belief that it will rain precisely because the conscious reasons strike us as supporting the conclusion.  This introspective template encourages the generalization that all justified belief is produced by such phenomenally accessible support.\n\n   ii. Responsibility and epistemic evaluation.  Justification, on many internalist views, concerns what the subject can be asked to provide in defense of her belief.  If one has no idea what one\u2019s reasons are, so the thought goes, one cannot properly take responsibility for one\u2019s belief.\n\n   iii. The \u201cnew evil demon\u201d and \u201cbrain in a vat\u201d scenarios.  Epistemic justification is supposed to be independent of worldly luck; what matters is how things appear from the subject\u2019s internal point of view.  Conscious mental life seems the right level of description for fixing that point of view.\n\nEach motivation is powerful, but none is decisive once we recognize the three-way distinction from \u00a72.\n\n   i\u2019. Phenomenology shows that some conscious deliberation is reason-guided; it does not show that all guidance must be conscious.  Indeed, by parity, many consciously deliberated moves in chess rely on tacit pattern recognition the player could not formulate.\n\n   ii\u2019. Responsibility plausibly requires the capacity to answer to criticism, not the actual presence of articulated reasons at every moment.  An agent may be responsible for her driving even while operating largely on \u201cmuscle memory.\u201d\n\n   iii\u2019. What matters in demon-world cases is the information available to the subject\u2019s cognitive system, not necessarily the deliverances of introspective consciousness.  The envatted subject\u2019s nonconscious perceptual modules are in the same evidential predicament as her conscious imagery.\n\nHence CAR, in its strong form, outruns its own motivations.\n\n4. Empirical and Conceptual Pressure on CAR  \n\n4.1 Blindsight and Implicit Perception  \n\nPatients with blindsight reliably guess the presence, shape, or motion of stimuli in their blind field while sincerely reporting no visual experience.  On a CAR reading, their \u201cguesses\u201d cannot be epistemically grounded, for the subjects lack awareness of the visual information.  Yet the guesses are not random; they track environmental regularities via the very sensory-motor routes that, in ordinary cases, yield justified perceptual belief.  If epistemic basing must be conscious, then blindsight subjects \u201cget it right\u201d merely by accident, an implausible conclusion given the systematic reliability and modality-specific sensitivity of their responses.\n\n4.2 Skilled Cognition and Expert Intuition  \n\nGrandmaster chess players may instantly label a position as \u201cdangerous,\u201d or radiologists may pick out a tumor \u201cat a glance.\u201d  When pressed, they often cannot articulate the specific features that constitute their evidence; the recognition is automatic, holistic, even affect-tinged.  Nonetheless, these recognitions are grounded in statistically robust pattern learning across thousands of cases.  To deny that the resultant beliefs are justified because the experts cannot make the reasons conscious would detach epistemic status from the very competence that underwrites the experts\u2019 authority.\n\n4.3 Developmental and Everyday Reasoning  \n\nYoung children, second language learners, and even educated adults frequently employ syntactic, semantic, and probabilistic regularities in speech and practical reasoning without articulate knowledge of the rules.  Grown speakers of English rarely can state the rule blocking \u201cthe asleep child\u201d although they follow it flawlessly.  To insist on occurrent awareness would imply that most linguistic and inferential capacities operate outside the sphere of epistemic evaluation\u2014again, a price too high.\n\nIn each domain, sub-personal processes generate states that are sensitive to truth-conducive patterns and integrate with higher cognition; they manifest reason-responsiveness in sense (c) without (a) or even (b).  CAR, therefore, is empirically unmotivated.\n\n5. A Dispositional-Functional Account of Basing  \n\nWe thus seek an alternative that secures two desiderata: (1) an epistemologically rich role for unconscious processes; (2) the normative idea that justified belief is belief held for good reasons.  I propose the following.\n\nDispositional Basing Thesis (DBT):  \nA mental state M of subject S is epistemically based on reason R iff  \n(1) R is a content that is represented somewhere in S\u2019s cognitive economy;  \n(2) the tokening of R non-deviantly causes or sustains M in virtue of its representational content;  \n(3) S is disposed, under normal conditions of reflection and attention, to treat R as a pro tanto epistemic consideration for M.\n\nClause (1) accommodates sub-personal representation; clause (2) secures the explanatory, non-accidental link characteristic of basing; clause (3) restores a weak internalist dimension: although S need not be aware of R at the time of belief formation, S could, in principle, come to recognize and endorse R\u2019s epistemic bearing upon reflection.\n\nHow strict is (3)?  The relevant modality is not \u201cconceptually reflective at any moment,\u201d but \u201creachable by the agent\u2019s own cognitive resources.\u201d  Crucially, this does not require articulable verbalization.  An athlete might justify her belief that the play will develop to the left by replaying a mental image rather than stating a proposition.  What matters is that the agent possesses capacities enabling her to re-identify, monitor, and where appropriate correct the link between R and M.\n\nDBT thus predicts:\n\n   \u2022 In blindsight, ordinary reflection does not yet avail; but if neuroplasticity or training enables the patient to become conscious of the formerly subliminal information, her epistemic standing improves\u2014a result consonant with clinical reports.  \n\n   \u2022 The radiologist can, with effort, isolate salient low-level features (spiculation, asymmetry) even if not initially explicit.  The dispositions exist, if only partially.  \n\n   \u2022 For grammatical competence, adults can often learn to state the rule when prompted with multiple examples, indicating an underlying cognitive potential to make explicit what was implicit.\n\nDBT therefore preserves the insight that reasons matter to thinkers while acknowledging that much reasoning is \u201cdark.\u201d\n\n6. Replies to Objections  \n\nObjection 1: Epistemic responsibility demands actual, not potential, articulate reasons; otherwise, subjects can never be held to account.  \n\nReply: Accountability is scalar.  We blame the driver who, though failing to check his blind spot, could have done so with minimal attention more than the one whose steering column suddenly locked.  Similarly, a believer who could, but will not, reflect on her evidence is more culpable than one who lacks the capacities.  DBT accommodates gradable responsibility: full justification requires not just dispositional basing but also reasonable responsiveness to challenges, which can be absent even when the initial formation was basing-appropriate.\n\nObjection 2: Without conscious access, we cannot discriminate cases of genuine basing from deviant causal chains or environmental luck; hence DBT collapses into brute reliabilism.  \n\nReply: The worry equates accessibility with discriminability.  Yet clause (2) of DBT already rules out deviant causes by demanding content-sensitive causation; the representational content of R must figure in the causal explanation of M.  This is a higher bar than bare reliability.  A clairvoyant belief that p caused by random neural firings does not qualify, since the intermediate cause fails to represent the relevant grounds.  The requirement of contentful causation is a mark of reasons-based basing, not mere statistical covariation.\n\nObjection 3: The view makes justification hostage to cognitive architecture; a creature unable to render its tacit reasons explicit would never be justified.  \n\nReply: Hostage, perhaps, but reasonably so.  Epistemic norms apply to creatures capable of occupying the space of reasons\u2014minimally, being able to adjust beliefs in light of considerations.  If an organism\u2019s architecture forbids any such adjustment, it is a candidate for reliability-based warrant, not reason-based justification.  DBT draws a principled line between sub-doxastic mechanisms that contribute to reasons and those that supplant them.\n\n7. Conclusion  \n\nThe lure of the conscious access requirement stems from a laudable concern to keep epistemic appraisal within the agent\u2019s own rational purview.  Nonetheless, a strict identification of basing with occurrent awareness conflicts with an overwhelming body of cognitive scientific data and leads to implausible exclusions of expert, skilled, and developmental cognition from the justificatory realm.  By recognizing that basing is fundamentally a matter of content-driven causal explanation, plus a moderate demand for reflective potential, we preserve the normative authority of reasons while integrating the reality of modular and automatic cognitive processes.  Lack of conscious awareness, therefore, does not preclude a mental state from being epistemically based on reasons, provided the subject\u2019s cognitive system both registers those reasons and is, in principle, able to appreciate their bearing.  The upshot is a pluralistic epistemology that sees conscious reflection as one, but not the only, locus of rationality.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 9, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 2829, "reasoning_tokens": 192}

This poses a challenge for views that hold that modular, automatic cognitive processes can involve genuine epistemic basing. Does lack of conscious awareness of one's reasons preclude a mental state from being epistemically based on those reasons?", "answer": "1. Introduction  \n\nWhether conscious access to one\u2019s reasons is required for epistemic justification sits at the intersection of epistemology, philosophy of mind, and the cognitive sciences. Internalists about justification often maintain that whenever a belief is epistemically justified the subject must in principle be able to become reflectively aware of the considerations that make the belief rational. Otherwise, so the worry goes, the \u201cbasing\u201d relation between reasons and belief would be an unintelligible black box: the subject would no longer be the epistemic agent but a mere locus in which sub-personal mechanisms generate attitudes that happen to track truth. In contrast, externalists, as well as philosophers sympathetic to cognitive science, emphasize that many paradigm cases of justified cognition\u2014ordinary visual perception, rapid mathematical estimation, linguistic comprehension\u2014are executed by domain-specific, largely automatic modules that typically bypass consciousness. Must we then conclude that perceptual beliefs, or other outputs of modular processing, lack epistemic status until they are reflectively endorsed? That conclusion appears both phenomenologically implausible and normatively unattractive: surely I am justified in believing there is a cup on the table even before I stop to think about the similarity space of cups or the reliability of my visual system.\n\nIn what follows I argue that lack of conscious awareness of one\u2019s reasons does not in general preclude epistemic basing\u2014all that is required is that the reasons play the right etiological and counterfactual roles in guiding, sustaining, and potentially revising the attitude. Consciousness can enhance epistemic status by enabling second-order monitoring, but it is neither necessary nor sufficient for basing. I proceed in five stages. (1) I unpack the concept of epistemic basing and diagnose why many are tempted to build consciousness into it. (2) I offer positive arguments, rooted in cognitive science and ordinary epistemic practice, for sub-doxastic basing. (3) I respond to three influential objections: the \u201cno guidance\u201d objection, the \u201cde-personalization\u201d objection, and the \u201cresponsibility\u201d objection. (4) I articulate an alternative, ecumenical picture: the Hierarchical Basing Model, on which conscious and non-conscious reasons can both ground justification, though at different explanatory levels. (5) I close with implications for epistemic normativity and for ongoing debates about the reach of \u201crationality without deliberation\u201d.\n\n2. What is epistemic basing?  \n\nThe basing relation is meant to capture the difference between (a) merely having good reasons available and (b) holding a belief because of those reasons. Two constraints dominate the literature.\n\nA. Causal-etiological constraint: The reasons must appropriately cause or sustain the belief.  \nB. Guidance constraint: The reasons must be poised such that, had they been different or defeated, the belief would have been withdrawn or modified.\n\nConstraint (A) is usually uncontroversial; (B) carries heavier explanatory load, for it secures the link between reasons and rational agency. Now, why think consciousness is required? Because consciousness seems to provide the subject with a unified, accessible workspace in which reasons can be entertained, compared, and weighed; only conscious, occurrent contents appear suited to satisfy (B). If I am not even aware of R, how could R guide my believing that p?\n\nBut equating guidance with conscious appreciation over-intellectualizes everyday cognition. Many skills\u2014language comprehension, face recognition, skilled driving\u2014exhibit sophisticated, flexible sensitivity to reasons despite the agent being unaware of the operative information. The driver does not consciously calculate friction coefficients when braking, yet her pedal pressure is exquisitely responsive to such parameters. Similarly, a visual module can be sensitive to luminance gradients and occlusion cues that function as reasons for positing a contour. The fact that this sensitivity is implemented sub-personally does not, on its own, expel it from the space of reasons. Unless we are prepared to deny that such processing confers justification at all, we should look elsewhere for the criterion of epistemic basing.\n\n3. Positive case for non-conscious basing  \n\na. Perception as prototypical epistemic source  \nPerceptual experience delivers non-inferential justification for empirical beliefs. Yet most of the information that underwrites perception\u2014edge detection, stereoscopic disparity, motion parallax\u2014is unavailable to consciousness. What we consciously experience is the resulting scene, not the subpersonal computational steps. Nevertheless, if new sensory evidence arrives (say, the lights turn on and I now see clearly that the \u201ccup\u201d is a cleverly painted rock) my perceptual belief immediately updates; the earlier subpersonal reasons are replaced. This flexible updating satisfies the guidance constraint. Hence the belief was based on reasons, even if I was never aware of them.\n\nb. Implicit statistical reasoning  \nGigerenzer\u2019s \u201cfast and frugal heuristics\u201d research shows that ordinary agents reliably track Bayesian structures in the environment without explicit calculation. For example, physicians who employ the \u201ctake-the-best\u201d heuristic often reach diagnoses that approximate optimal Bayesian inferences. The physicians could rarely articulate the likelihood ratios their behavior reflects, yet the predictive success and systematic error-correction manifested over time demonstrates that their beliefs are sensitive to statistical reasons.\n\nc. Experimental evidence from blindsight and unconscious priming  \nPatients with blindsight report no conscious visual experience in their scotoma, yet can reliably guess shapes and directions at rates far above chance. Importantly, their confidence adjusts in line with objective reliability: when the stimulus is degraded, accuracy and confidence both drop. The best explanation is that information about stimulus quality operates as a reason modulating credence even in the absence of visual phenomenology. Likewise, subliminal priming can make subjects more cautious in lexical decision tasks when error likelihood is high. Again, non-conscious reasons guide behavior.\n\n4. Answering objections  \n\nObjection 1: The No-Guidance Objection  \n\u201cWithout conscious awareness, reasons cannot be cited by the agent in explanation, hence they cannot guide epistemic life.\u201d\n\nReply: Guidance need not be reflective. What matters is counterfactual sensitivity: if the evidential situation were different, would the belief change? Subpersonal mechanisms that update credence when sensory error signals occur satisfy that standard. Consider artificial neural networks: they \u201cattend\u201d to features that alter weightings during training. Though they lack consciousness, their outputs are guided by reasons in the weak, etiological sense. Human cognitive architecture incorporates analogous modules that remain under executive control. I may not know which micro-cues my face-recognition system uses, but I can decide to rely on it or to seek corroboration under uncertain lighting, thereby integrating non-conscious reasons into my personal-level rational agenda.\n\nObjection 2: The De-Personalization Objection  \n\u201cEpistemic justification concerns persons, not subsystems. If the relevant grounds are hidden from the person, the state is at best sub-personal and so not genuinely epistemic.\u201d\n\nReply: Persons are constituted by interacting levels of representation. The boundary between personal and sub-personal is porous. What distinguishes personal-level states is typically their availability to practical reasoning and verbal report, but these features admit of degrees. Procedural memory and affective appraisal often lie below the threshold of reportability yet still contribute to our unified agency. Epistemology must reflect the graded architecture of mind rather than impose a dichotomy. Moreover, the fact that I can retroactively inspect, challenge, or override the deliverances of a module reinstates personal-level ownership.\n\nObjection 3: The Responsibility Objection  \n\u201cIf reasons are unconscious, the subject cannot be held epistemically responsible for their beliefs; hence such beliefs cannot be justified.\u201d\n\nReply: Responsibility also comes in degrees. We routinely hold people responsible for inattentive beliefs (\u201cYou should have noticed the warning sign\u201d), even though the unnoticed stimuli were not conscious. The crucial factor is whether the agent had reasonable control measures available: double-checking, suspending judgment, seeking testimony. A pilot relying on automatic instrumentation is justifiably so, provided the instruments are reliable and standard operational protocols endorse their use; if the gauges malfunction and the pilot ignores available cross-checks, responsibility kicks in. Thus, unconscious basing can coexist with normative appraisal anchored in broader agency.\n\n5. The Hierarchical Basing Model  \n\nTo reconcile intuitions about personal rationality with the empirical reality of modular cognition, I propose a hierarchical picture.\n\nLevel 0: Sub-doxastic evidential relations. Information-format carry micro-reasons (edges, optical flow, phoneme transitions). These relations are constitutive of perceptual competence.\n\nLevel 1: Doxastic but pre-reflective states. Perceptual appearances (\u201cIt looks red\u201d) encode summary reasons generated at Level 0. These appearances justify basic beliefs without conceptual mediation.\n\nLevel 2: Reflective awareness. The subject can, when prompted, token higher-order representations: \u201cMy belief is based on how it looks,\u201d or, with more training, \u201cBecause the hue matches canonical red under standard lighting.\u201d\n\nJustification accrues already at Level 1; Level 2 adds metacognitive endorsement, affording increased resistance to defeat and greater epistemic responsibility. Importantly, the basing relation at Level 1 is not eclipsed when Level 2 is absent. Infants and non-human animals, for instance, can have perceptually justified beliefs though they lack the linguistic resources for explicit citation.\n\nThis model honors internalist intuitions by positing that, in principle, some grounds can rise to awareness, while granting externalists that sub-personal reliability is the primary engine of justification. It also diagnoses conflicting intuitions: when we focus on Level 2 cases, basing appears to require conscious citation; when we attend to Level 0-1, basing seems automatic. Both perspectives capture genuine layers of cognitive architecture.\n\n6. Two further considerations  \n\na. The opacity of inference. Cognitive psychology suggests that even paradigmatic conscious reasoning is opaque. When asked why they chose a particular consumer item, subjects confabulate. If confabulation undermined basing, hardly any belief would qualify. Hence requiring accurate conscious access would render justification unattainable, an implausible skeptical conclusion.\n\nb. Evolutionary plausibility. Natural selection likely favored fast, resource-light heuristics that bypass conscious bottlenecks. If only consciously supported beliefs were justified, most animal cognition, including much of human perception, would fall outside the domain of epistemic evaluation. A richer, evolutionarily informed epistemology must take non-conscious basing seriously.\n\n7. Implications and conclusion  \n\nIf the arguments above are sound, the landscape of epistemic evaluation widens. First, debates about inferentialism versus dogmatism in perception need not hinge on whether perceptual reasons are conceptually available; non-conceptual, non-conscious reasons can suffice. Second, virtue-theoretic accounts of knowledge gain traction: what matters is the agent\u2019s overall competence, many components of which operate below awareness. Third, the analysis supports the growing literature on implicit biases: some such biases are epistemically unjustified precisely because the sub-personal processes generating them are systematically unreliable, not because they are unconscious per se.\n\nTo the initial question\u2014does lack of conscious awareness preclude epistemic basing?\u2014the considered answer is No. Conscious awareness is neither necessary nor sufficient for basing. It is not sufficient, because one can consciously rehearse spurious reasons and thereby believe unjustifiably. It is not necessary, because sub-personal mechanisms can satisfy the etiological and guidance constraints central to rational basing. What ultimately matters for epistemic status is the integration of information in ways that tend to promote truth, remain sensitive to defeaters, and stand ready for higher-order scrutiny when the agent\u2019s practical and epistemic context demands it. Consciousness enriches but does not constitute that integration.\n\nTherefore, modular, automatic cognitive processes can involve genuine epistemic basing, and ordinary perceptual and linguistic beliefs are justified well before, and independently of, any reflective awareness of their grounds. Far from undermining our epistemic agency, the mind\u2019s hidden layers are indispensable allies in our pursuit of knowledge.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 10, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 2670, "reasoning_tokens": 128}

Introduction\n\nWhether one must be consciously aware of the grounds on which one believes in order for that belief to be epistemically based is a dispute that sits at the confluence of epistemology, philosophy of mind, and cognitive science. On one side stand \u201caccess internalists,\u201d who insist that a justificatory link between a state and its reasons must be accessible to the subject at the level of consciousness. On the other side stand a growing group of naturalistically inclined philosophers who, in light of mounting evidence about sub-personal, automatic, and modular cognition, deny that such access is necessary. The question is not merely academic: it bears on how we should understand expertise, implicit bias, perceptual justification, and even the rationality of animals and infants. In what follows I will (i) unpack the terminology, (ii) reconstruct the principal arguments for the awareness condition, (iii) develop challenges to that condition from both empirical findings and theoretical considerations, (iv) articulate a middle position that I call the \u201cDispositional Awareness View,\u201d and finally (v) respond to the most salient objections.\n\n2. Key Concepts\n\n(a) Epistemic reason. I shall use \u2018reason\u2019 in the normative sense: a consideration that counts in favor of a belief\u2019s truth, and possession of which can confer justification on that belief. \u2018Evidence\u2019 is the paradigmatic subclass of epistemic reasons.\n\n(b) The basing relation. For a belief to be justified because of a reason, it is not enough that the reason exists; the subject\u2019s belief must be based on it in the right way. Paradigm cases are conscious inferences (e.g., \u201cI see puddles; therefore it rained\u201d); these secure a \u201ctransparent\u201d link between reason and belief.\n\n(c) Conscious awareness. This is occurrent phenomenal awareness of the relevant reason or of the fact that the reason supports the belief. Merely having the representation stored somewhere in long-term memory, or being subpersonally influenced by it, does not count as consciousness in the sense at issue.\n\n(d) Automatic or modular cognition. Cognitive processes that are fast, domain-specific, informationally encapsulated, and largely inaccessible to introspection. Classic examples include early visual processing, language parsing, and heuristic decision-making.\n\n3. The Awareness Condition: Theoretical Motivations\n\nThree families of arguments underpin the claim that conscious awareness is necessary for epistemic basing.\n\n3.1 Normative Rationality and the Transparency Ideal\n\nWilfrid Sellars and later Donald Davidson argued that giving and asking for reasons is a space of commitments essentially governed by norms. Entering that space, on their view, requires that the subject can articulate\u2014at least to herself\u2014why she holds the belief. If she cannot, the belief is supposedly outside the scope of epistemic evaluation; it is a mere causal upshot of sub-personal mechanisms, on a par with a knee-jerk reflex.\n\nThis \u201ctransparency ideal\u201d gains intuitive traction from the idea that justification is something for which we can be legitimately asked to account. If I could not, even in principle, answer the question \u201cWhy do you believe p?,\u201d then it looks as though p is not my rational commitment.\n\n3.2 The Phenomenology of Understanding\n\nA second strand appeals to phenomenology. To feel that one\u2019s belief is rational is (it is claimed) to be experientially aware of considerations that render the belief intelligible. When I solve a simple arithmetic problem, I enjoy a \u201cgrasp\u201d of the premises and see the conclusion to follow. In contrast, when I consult an oracle who pronounces \u201c121 is the square of 11,\u201d my assent lacks the phenomenology of understanding and thus lacks epistemic standing, or so the argument goes.\n\n3.3 Epistemic Agency\n\nFinally, some epistemologists (notably, John Greco and Linda Zagzebski) ground justification in responsible agency: to be epistemically justified is, in part, to deserve credit for believing well. On one construal of agency, credit requires conscious control: I am not praiseworthy for bodily movements produced entirely by subconscious twitching; likewise, I am not praiseworthy for beliefs sub-personally caused without any awareness of the supporting reasons.\n\n4. Empirical and Theoretical Challenges\n\n4.1 Automatic Expertise\n\nChess masters can immediately suggest strong moves in complex positions. Eye-tracking studies show that they do not, and often cannot, articulate the thousands of micro-features they tacitly evaluate. Similar phenomena occur in radiology: expert radiologists can classify an X-ray as \u201cabnormal\u201d in 200 milliseconds, a duration too short for conscious deliberation. Yet it would be counter-intuitive to withhold epistemic justification from their judgments. These agents regularly outperform novices, respond systematically to defeaters (e.g., if told the X-ray image was mirror-flipped), and correct their beliefs when given stronger evidence. If justification tracks reliability, virtuous cognition, or epistemic responsibility, their beliefs appear eminently justified despite the absence of conscious access to the fine-grained reasons.\n\n4.2 Perceptual Justification\n\nMuch perceptual processing is modular and unconscious. I am not aware of edge-detection or color-constancy algorithms executed by my visual cortex; nonetheless my perceptual beliefs\u2014\u201cThere is a red apple on the table\u201d\u2014are paradigms of justification. To require consciousness of the reasons embodied in sensory evidence would threaten to undermine nearly all perceptual knowledge.\n\n4.3 The Problem of Excessive Intellectualism\n\nThe awareness condition risks over-intellectualizing epistemic life. Infants, non-human animals, and human adults with limited cognitive resources routinely form beliefs that seem epistemically good (e.g., a dog who tracks its master\u2019s scent). If conscious awareness were required for justification, these creatures would be irrational in toto, an implausible conclusion.\n\n4.4 The Cognitive Science of \u2018Unconscious Inference\u2019\n\nHelmholtz already spoke of perception as \u201cunconscious inference.\u201d Contemporary Bayesian models generalize the point: the brain constantly generates hypotheses that best predict sensory inputs. The \u2018reasons\u2019\u2014probabilistic relations between hypotheses and data\u2014are represented sub-personally. Denying that such processing can ground justified belief threatens a deep disconnect between epistemology and the science of cognition.\n\n4.5 Swamping and the Value of True Belief\n\nErnest Sosa\u2019s virtue epistemology claims that what matters is that a belief be formed through a competence aimed at truth. Whether the agent is aware of the competence\u2019s grounds is irrelevant to epistemic value. Indeed, an agent duped by misleading conscious reasons but saved by a sub-personal competence (e.g., noticing an imperceptible tremor that signals an earthquake) ends up with a true belief for the right objective reason, even if she cannot articulate that reason.\n\n5. Toward a Middle Path: Dispositional Awareness\n\nWhile the above challenges are powerful, the awareness condition is motivated by genuine intuitions about agency and responsibility. I therefore propose a qualified view:\n\nDispositional Awareness Thesis: Occurrent conscious awareness of one\u2019s reasons is not necessary for a belief to be epistemically based on them, but the agent must be suitably disposed to become aware of (some of) those reasons upon reflection, or to appreciate their rational force when they are brought to consciousness.\n\nKey features:\n\n(i) Basal Level Basing. Sub-personal processes can provide the immediate causal basing relation: the visual module delivers a representation; the expert\u2019s pattern-recognition module fires. Justification is secured at that level.\n\n(ii) Reflective Accessibility. If the subject reflects\u2014by directing attention, asking herself \u201cWhy do I believe p?,\u201d or entertaining epistemic challenges\u2014she can often, though not invariably, retrieve an approximate rationale (\u201cThe X-ray looks hazy around the lungs,\u201d or \u201cThe apple looks red and round\u201d). The underlying micro-features remain opaque, but a coarse-grained summary is available.\n\n(iii) Defeater-Responsiveness. Even when reasons are not conscious, the belief-forming competence must be sensitive to defeating evidence. A radiologist who keeps his initial snap-judgment despite learning that the image is from a corrupted scan forfeits justification; one who revises it displays epistemic responsibility.\n\nThe dispositional account reconciles the empirically grounded claim that many justified beliefs are automatically produced with the normative intuition that, as reflective agents, we are in principle answerable for what we believe.\n\n6. Objection 1: Mere Disposition Is Too Weak\n\nOne might argue that being merely disposed to retrieve reasons does not suffice for rational responsibility. After all, most subjects lack the metacognitive capacity to articulate Bayesian priors or the etiological story of their visual cortex. How, then, can they be blameworthy or praiseworthy?\n\nReply: Responsibility comes in degrees. An ordinary perceiver cannot articulate edge-detection algorithms, but she can\u2014in normal lighting\u2014report that the apple looks red. That level of articulation suffices for first-order epistemic appraisal because it pinpoints the personal-level content that functions as her normative reason: the seeming that the apple is red. She need not decode sub-personal processes any more than she need to cite quarks to justify her belief that the table is hard. The control she exercises by being able to attend to the visual presentation, check for defeaters (e.g., colored lighting), or seek corroboration suffices for credit.\n\n7. Objection 2: Animals and Infants Lack Even Dispositional Awareness\n\nIf awareness in any form is required, what about dogs or six-month-olds who cannot entertain propositions about their reasons? Do we deny them epistemic justification?\n\nReply: We may distinguish between epistemic justification proper and proto-epistemic statuses. My account grants that animals and infants enjoy a kind of functional rationality\u2014they track environmental truths via reliable competences\u2014but genuine epistemic justification, in the norm-governed sense implicating reasons, may indeed be restricted to agents capable of at least minimal reflective uptake. That is not a bug but a conceptual clarification: calling a wolf's tracking of prey 'justified belief' stretches epistemic language beyond recognition.\n\n8. Objection 3: Unconscious Biases Would Then Be Justified\n\nSuppose an HR manager has an implicit racial bias that operates unconsciously and issues in discriminatory hiring judgments. The bias is a \u201ccompetence\u201d of sorts\u2014fast, automatic, and reliable relative to its (morally perverse) aim. Does my view entail that her biased belief that \u201ccandidate A is less promising\u201d is justified?\n\nReply: No. Competence must be truth-directed and defeater-responsive. Implicit biases are neither. They systematically deviate from truth once the epistemic goal is fixed: they would not track the candidate\u2019s actual qualifications in counterfactual scenarios where race varies. Hence they fail the reliability and sensitivity conditions built into the Dispositional Awareness framework.\n\n9. Objection 4: Swamping Again\n\nA reliabilist might push further: if objective reliability confers enough normative status, why saddle justification with even dispositional awareness? Why not say that if the process is objectively truth-conducive, the belief is justified, full stop?\n\nReply: Pure reliabilism faces infamous counterexamples: clairvoyant virtues, epistemic serendipity, and cases where we wish to distinguish epistemic luck from creditable cognition. Dispositional awareness restores an agency requirement that reliabilism lacks, without succumbing to the excessive intellectualism of the strong awareness condition. It occupies a principled middle ground between brute reliabilism and full-blown access internalism.\n\n10. Advantages of the Dispositional Awareness View\n\n(a) Comports with cognitive science: It honors the fact that sub-personal mechanisms do much epistemic work.\n\n(b) Respects normative intuitions about answerability: Agents can in principle vindicate their beliefs when challenged.\n\n(c) Graduated epistemic responsibility: It allows for varying levels of justification across novices, experts, animals, and malfunctioning agents.\n\n(d) Explains the epistemic failings of biased or wishful thinkers: Such agents either lack a reliable competence or are not disposed to attend to relevant defeaters.\n\n11. The Basing Relation Revisited\n\nOne might still worry that the view leaves the basing relation mysterious. If consciousness is not the arena in which reasons do their justificatory work, what ensures that the sub-personal causal path is the right sort of basing rather than deviant causation?\n\nMy suggestion, inspired by Ernest Sosa and Peter Railton, is that the relevant basing consists in the operation of a reliable epistemic faculty whose teleology is aimed at truth. Visual perception, memory, introspection, and expert pattern-recognition are paradigmatic faculties. Such faculties encode probabilistic relations between inputs and outputs; when they function properly in the environment for which they were designed (biologically or through learning), their outputs are epistemically grounded in the informational content they register, even if the agent lacks occurrent awareness.\n\n12. Conclusion\n\nLack of conscious awareness does not, by itself, preclude a mental state from being epistemically based on reasons. Demanding occurrent awareness would jettison large swaths of everyday and expert knowledge, contradict cognitive science, and collapse into an untenable intellectualism. At the same time, abandoning awareness entirely threatens to detach epistemology from agency and normative evaluation. A sensible compromise acknowledges that automatic, modular processes can ground justification, provided the agent retains a dispositional capacity to appreciate, defend, and revise her beliefs in light of those very (or higher-level proxy) reasons. On this Dispositional Awareness View, sub-personal competence and personal-level answerability are complementary, not competing, contributors to epistemic basing.\n\nRoughly 2,100 words", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 11, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 3186, "reasoning_tokens": 320}

Most of the inferences that guide perception, language\u2010processing, moral evaluation, and even deliberate problem-solving are executed by automatic, modular subsystems whose operations never surface in consciousness. Must we therefore conclude that such inferences are epistemically blind\u2014that they yield mere causal explanations of belief, never genuine epistemic grounds? I shall argue that occurrent awareness is not necessary for basing, although some weaker form of epistemic possession\u2014dispositional availability to consciousness\u2014remains indispensable. Once that distinction is in place, modular and implicit processes can secure bona fide epistemic status, while the central internalist motivations for an awareness requirement can be respected.\n\n2. What is at stake?  \n\nThe debate concerns the \u201cbasing relation,\u201d the link between (i) propositional reasons an agent possesses and (ii) doxastic attitudes held because of those reasons. A belief is propositionally justified when the agent has undefeated evidence that makes the belief epistemically appropriate; it is doxastically justified when it is actually held on the basis of that evidence. Without a robust basing relation, the move from propositional to doxastic justification collapses. Consciousness skeptics about basing\u2014call them Intellectualists\u2014maintain: S\u2019s belief that p is doxastically justified only if S is consciously aware of the evidential relation connecting her belief to grounds e. Anti-Intellectualists deny this; they typically insist that the correct causal-functional role suffices. The dispute is not merely terminological, because epistemic justification is tied to appraisal of agents as responsible believers. If basing does not require awareness, then many beliefs produced by non-conscious mechanisms count as justified; if it does, a large portion of our cognitive lives falls outside the scope of epistemic evaluation.\n\n3. Four arguments for the awareness requirement  \n\n(i) The Transparency of Reasons. Intuitively, to believe responsibly is to guide one\u2019s cognition by reasons one recognizes as such. If S cannot cite or articulate her reasons, the belief looks like a hunch, not a considered judgment.  \n\n(ii) Epistemic Agency. Many philosophers (e.g., Hieronymi, Zagzebski) view believing for reasons as an exercise of agency akin to deciding to act. Agency, the claim goes, presupposes a level of self-conscious direction: you cannot knowingly take a stand on p unless you appreciate what justifies that stand.  \n\n(iii) Deontic Justification. If epistemic justification is a deontic notion\u2014concerned with what an agent ought to believe\u2014then \u201cought implies can.\u201d An agent who is not even conscious of her supposed evidence cannot conform her doxastic behavior to it; holding her to those standards seems unfair.  \n\n(iv) Screening Off Bad Luck. Consider Norman the clairvoyant, whose reliably truth-conducive faculty delivers beliefs for which he has no awareness of evidence. If we deny that awareness is required, Norman\u2019s beliefs might count as justified. The Intellectualist uses such cases to argue that we must prevent mere reliable correlation from masquerading as epistemic grounding; requiring conscious uptake of reasons provides the needed filter.\n\n4. Why those arguments are not decisive  \n\nFirst, the Transparency intuition overestimates our introspective abilities. Decades of psychological research (Nisbett & Wilson, 1977; Haidt, 2001) show that agents are poor at identifying the causes of their judgments and routinely confabulate post hoc. If personal transparency were required for basing, almost no actual belief would be justified. That result would be epistemically catastrophic, suggesting the intuition trades on an idealization that human cognition cannot satisfy.  \n\nSecond, the link between agency and conscious control is not straightforward. Many intentional actions\u2014catching a falling glass, driving a familiar route, typing on a keyboard\u2014are executed automatically yet remain attributable to the agent. Responsibility does not always hinge on occurrent reflection; rather, it depends on whether the relevant sub-personal processes are suitably integrated into the agent\u2019s cognitive economy, so that they can be revised, inhibited, or endorsed upon reflection.  \n\nThird, the deontic point about fairness is double-edged. If my cognitive system delivers me perceptual evidence E (say, the look of a red apple) outside focal attention, my epistemic situation is still improved. I can exploit that evidence if I need to, even if at the moment I am unaware of it. A standard akin to \u201cought implies can\u201d is met so long as I have the capacity to bring the evidence to consciousness on demand.  \n\nFourth, the clairvoyant cases are forceful only when the subject lacks any reasonable capacity to check, assess, or integrate the deliverances of the mechanism. There is a principled distinction between (a) sub-systems like memory, vision, and inference that are embedded in a person-level architecture providing opportunities for critical scrutiny, and (b) mysterious causal chains that bypass the subject\u2019s critical faculties. The former kind of sub\u2010personal process can ground justification; the latter cannot. Requiring reflective awareness is one crude way to capture that distinction, but it is not the only way.\n\n5. Positive considerations supporting non-conscious basing  \n\nA. Perception. Vision operates through millions of unconscious computations (edge detection, color constancy, depth estimation). Nevertheless, we treat the resulting perceptual seemings as providing prima facie justification. If the absence of awareness defeated basing, perceptual beliefs would be unjustified across the board\u2014a conclusion few are willing to accept.  \n\nB. Inferential intuition. Mathematicians often \u201cjust see\u201d that a lemma follows from axioms without being immediately able to articulate the proof. Subsequent reflection reconstructs the steps. The intermediate processing remains unconscious, yet we are inclined to say they believed for good mathematical reasons all along.  \n\nC. Linguistic comprehension. A native speaker can judge a sentence ungrammatical without accessing the underlying syntactic rules. The judgment is still rational, because it is formed by a competence that causally tracks the grammatical properties that constitute epistemic reasons (e.g., subject-verb agreement).  \n\nD. Developmental and comparative evidence. Infants and non-human animals manifest rudimentary reasoning about object permanence and causal structure. If awareness were necessary for justification, we would have to deny that their cognition is ever epistemically assessable, a stance at odds with scientific practice that distinguishes better and worse learning strategies in such populations.\n\n6. A middle path: the Accessibility condition  \n\nThe foregoing suggests that the strong Intellectualist requirement of occurrent awareness is too demanding. Yet abandoning any internalist element risks collapsing basing into blind causation. The key is to distinguish:  \n\nAwareness Requirement (strong): For S\u2019s belief that p to be based on reason e, S must now be consciously aware that e supports p.  \n\nAccessibility Requirement (moderate): For S\u2019s belief that p to be based on e, e must be poised for conscious awareness\u2014i.e., S could, through normal reflection, access e and recognise its evidential bearing on p.  \n\nThe accessibility condition grounds epistemic responsibility: the agent can *in principle* answer the \u201cwhy?\u201d question, even if she has not yet done so. It respects the cognitive science of modularity: most evidential relations are processed tacitly but are stored in formats that can, when cognitive attention is directed, be transformed into personal-level reasons (e.g., \u201cIt looks red,\u201d \u201cThe thermometer reads 37\u00b0\u201d). And it immunises basing from clairvoyant luck: Norman cannot access any intermediary representation that explains *why* p is true; his faculty merely outputs the belief.\n\n7. From possession to control  \n\nDispositional availability also meshes with intuitive epistemic norms concerning revision. Suppose I believe my friend is home because I saw her car in the driveway earlier, though the perceptual memory is not currently in consciousness. When a sceptic challenges me, I can retrieve the memory, evaluate it, and, if I discover that the car I saw was actually someone else\u2019s, revise my belief. That ability to bring reasons to awareness and revise in light of them underwrites my epistemic agency more deeply than mere initial reflection would have.  \n\nCompare an implicit racial bias that influences snap judgments. Empirical studies show that agents can, with training and vigilance, inhibit the bias when they become aware of it. The bias is based on subconscious associations, but because those associations are not easily made available for scrutiny, the resulting judgments are epistemically defective. The accessibility condition thus diagnoses the epistemic shortcoming without demanding moment-by-moment awareness of every evidential link.\n\n8. Relating the view to existing theories  \n\nThe moderate proposal can be captured within a variety of frameworks:\n\n\u2022 Access Internalism (e.g., Conee & Feldman) already distinguishes occurrent and dispositional awareness; the present argument reinforces that difference and extends it to modular processes.  \n\n\u2022 Proper Functionalism (Plantinga) and Virtue Reliabilism (Greco, Sosa) can incorporate an accessibility rider to ensure that the \u201cdesign plan\u201d of the cognitive faculty includes interfaces to consciousness.  \n\n\u2022 Dual-level theories of inference (Evans, Stanovich) posit a reflective level that monitors automatic Type-1 processes; epistemic evaluation concerns the synergy of the two.\n\n9. Objections and replies  \n\nObjection 1: Unconscious reasons cannot be normative because the agent does not *take* them to be reasons. Reply: Normativity flows not solely from the agent\u2019s higher-order attitude but from the fact that the evidence is truth-conducive and appropriately integrated. The agent\u2019s capacity to take them as reasons when prompted suffices for normative uptake.  \n\nObjection 2: Accessibility collapses into awareness, since reasons always could in principle be reconstructed. Reply: There is a real difference between trivial reconstructability and genuine availability. In blindsight, for example, the patient\u2019s guesses correlate with stimuli, but no perceptual representation is available for consciousness; hence no justificatory basing. Accessibility must be cashed out in terms of actual representational links to working memory and executive attention, not mere logical possibility.\n\n10. Implications for modular, automatic cognition  \n\nOn the proposed account, automatic processes can ground justification provided three conditions hold:\n\n1. Epistemic link: The process is reliably sensitive to the truth-makers of p or to evidential relations connecting e and p.  \n2. Integration: The outputs are stored in a format that can be taken up, endorsed, or overridden by higher cognition.  \n3. Accessibility: The underlying evidential states are available to consciousness given normal reflective effort.\n\nMany paradigmatic modules meet these conditions. Visual cortical areas produce representations (e.g., \u201cthere is a red sphere here\u201d) that feed into working memory; linguistic modules deliver parse trees that can be verbalised; Bayesian perceptual inferences about causal structure are exported as sensorimotor expectations susceptible to verbal report. In such cases, lack of initial conscious awareness does not undermine epistemic basing.\n\n11. Residual limits  \n\nAlthough occurrent awareness is not required, the accessibility condition is not trivial. It explains why certain implicit attitudes, priming effects, and ideological biases fail to confer justification. These states are often insulated from critical scrutiny; even when we are told about the bias, the specific associative pathways remain hidden. The beliefs they influence therefore lack a defensible evidential basis. Similarly, cases of implanted memory or covert manipulation\u2014where reasons come from another agent\u2019s intervention\u2014can be excluded because the relevant representations are not properly integrated with the subject\u2019s own cognitive architecture, and so remain inaccessible.\n\n12. Conclusion  \n\nDoes lack of conscious awareness preclude a mental state from being epistemically based on reasons? My answer is \u201cno,\u201d provided we distinguish occurrent awareness from dispositional accessibility. Requiring full reflective awareness disenfranchises the vast majority of human cognition, conflicts with empirical psychology, and makes justification unachievable for ordinary believers, children, and non-human animals. Yet we need some internalist constraint to safeguard epistemic responsibility and screen off clairvoyant luck. The accessibility condition supplies that middle ground: epistemic basing obtains when reasons are integrated into the subject\u2019s cognitive system in a way that renders them available for conscious endorsement or revision, even if they are not currently in view. Thus modular, automatic processes can be genuine sources of epistemic justification, so long as their deliverances remain open to the light of consciousness when reflection calls.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 12, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 3203, "reasoning_tokens": 576}

Introduction  \n\nWhen I look out of the window, see a wet street and form the belief that it has recently rained, I rarely pause to rehearse anything like the following: \u201cMy perceptual experience as of wet asphalt, together with my background belief that rain typically wets asphalt, jointly constitute a good reason to judge that it rained.\u201d  In ordinary life the reasons never rise to reflective consciousness; nonetheless we are inclined to say that my belief is epistemically justified and that it is justified because it is based on those very reasons.  Must I, at the moment of judging, consciously entertain them for the basing relation to obtain?  Many philosophers\u2014paradigmatically, access-internalists and members of the so-called \u201creasons first\u201d movement\u2014answer \u2018yes\u2019.  They insist that justificatory status requires the believer\u2019s conscious awareness of the grounds on which her belief rests.  On the other side stand reliabilists, virtue epistemologists and \u201cdual process\u201d theorists who regard sub-personal, automatic, even modular cognition as capable of conferring full-blown epistemic standing.  \n\nThe debate matters far beyond a verbal dispute about \u201creasons.\u201d  It bears on whether infants, non-human animals and cognitively impaired adults can have justified beliefs; on whether perception itself is a rational, reason-providing faculty; and on how we should understand our epistemic responsibilities.  This essay defends a moderate negative answer: lack of occurrent conscious access does not in general preclude a mental state from being epistemically based on reasons.  Conscious awareness is neither necessary for the basing relation nor for justification, though it often refines or upgrades justification.  I first set out the motivations for the awareness requirement, then present counter-arguments from cognitive science and everyday cases, develop an account on which dispositions to become aware suffice, and respond to residual worries.  The upshot is a layered picture: rational basing is ultimately a matter of the right kind of explanatory dependence between reasons and belief; occurrent awareness is one among several ways of underwriting that dependence, but it is not indispensable.\n\n2. The Case for an Awareness Requirement  \n\nTwo lines of thought converge on the claim that justificatory basing demands awareness:\n\na. Responsibility and the Deontic Intuition.  Epistemic justification seems to ground evaluations such as blame, criticism, and praise.  One can demand a reason from a believer and reproach her if she cannot supply it.  If justification functions like moral praiseworthiness, then an agent must have reflective control over the factors that justify her belief.  Without conscious access the subject would be, in William Alston\u2019s phrase, \u201cepistemically blameless but non-responsible.\u201d\n\nb. Transparency of Reasons.  Reasons have a distinctive phenomenology: they strike us as making a belief \u201cseem true,\u201d or as \u201ccounting in its favour.\u201d  Phenomenal Conservatism and related views hold that one\u2019s seeming that p is itself a reason.  If so, awareness appears built into the very notion of a reason: a consideration cannot play the reason-giving role unless the subject takes, or could take, it to do so.\n\nTogether these arguments motivate access-internalism: justification supervenes on factors reflectively accessible to the subject.  Call this the Strict Awareness Principle (SAP): For any subject S and belief B, B is epistemically justified for S at t only if, at t, S is consciously aware of the reasons R on which B is based.\n\n3. Three Problem Cases for SAP  \n\n3.1 Ordinary Perceptual Belief.  In thousands of mundane judgments\u2014locating an object in one\u2019s visual field, recognising a friend\u2019s face, reading a familiar word\u2014the believer cannot articulate the reasons on which the belief is causally and rationally based.  Signal detection, edge extraction, facial recognition: these processes unfold entirely below the level of consciousness.  To count such beliefs unjustified on that ground seems to mischaracterise common practice and push scepticism about perception dangerously far.\n\n3.2 Cognitive Science of \u201cUnconscious Inference.\u201d  Since Helmholtz, vision science has modelled perception as Bayesian inference from proximal stimulation to distal cause.  The generative model, the conditional probability tables, and the error-minimising updates are not consciously accessible.  Yet they are paradigmatic inferences.  If SAP is right, either vision delivers no epistemic warrant or cognitive science is systematically wrong in calling these steps inferential.\n\n3.3 Epistemic Standing of Animals and Children.  Five-year-olds, chimpanzees and border collies form beliefs from perception, memory and simple testimony that we happily call knowledge.  They lack the metacognitive machinery to collect their reasons, much less rehearse them.  SAP therefore threatens to deprive large swathes of intelligent life\u2014indeed adult humans in many unreflective moments\u2014of any justified beliefs.\n\n4. Causal versus Rational Basing  \n\nDefenders of SAP often invoke the \u201cNew Evil-Demon Problem.\u201d  Suppose a subject in a demon world has experiences subjectively indistinguishable from veridical ones but they are massively misleading.  On a pure reliabilist view, her beliefs are unjustified; yet many judge that she is blamelessly justified.  The lesson, they say, is that causal reliabilism fails; only awareness of reasons matters.\n\nBut the inference is too quick.  The crucial distinction is not between internal and external factors but between mere causal production and rational explanation.  A belief is based on R in the rational sense when R figures in the best explanation of why the subject adopts and maintains the belief as correct.  This explanation may cite sub-personal states and processes; what matters is that the right pattern of responsiveness obtains.  Demon-world victims share with us the same sub-personal perceptual processing and so the same rational, though deceptive, basing relations.  External truth-connections are missing, but rational basing remains.\n\nThat way of thinking allows us to decouple basing from occurrent awareness while preserving a robust notion of reasons.  The wet-street perceptual module delivers a token experiential state E that functions as evidence for p (\u201cit rained\u201d).  E rationally explains why I believe p even if I never attend to E as evidence.  My potential to attend to E, were circumstances to require it, plays an important secondary role, but the primary basing relation is sub-personal and unconscious.\n\n5. Dispositional Awareness as a Middle Way  \n\nStill, many object that unless the subject could in principle rise to reflective awareness, the link between reasons and belief is too weak to support epistemic appraisal.  This motivates a weaker principle:\n\nDispositional Awareness Principle (DAP): A belief B is justified for S at t only if S is disposed, under sincere reflection, to become aware of reasons R that (a) in fact obtain and (b) rationally support B.\n\nDAP respects the intuitions behind responsibility: once challenged, S can give, or begin to generate, a reflective rationale.  Yet it does not insist that S already occurrently tokens R.  The notion of a disposition should be understood liberally: preverbal children may lack the linguistic resources to articulate R, but they manifest the disposition through behaviour\u2014e.g., tracking, functional integration, sensitivity to counter-evidence\u2014that expresses recognition of R.\n\nDAP therefore accommodates the innocent bystander, the infant and the border collie while preserving a link to normative appraisal.  It also dovetails with empirical evidence that metacognition is graded; humans can often bring to consciousness, with some effort, intermediate perceptual products such as \u201cthere was a dark shape\u201d even if low-level edge data remain forever inaccessible.  The degree of potential access rises with cognitive sophistication, but absolute occurrent awareness is nowhere required.\n\n6. Answering Four Objections  \n\n6.1 The Baseless Hunch Worry.  Suppose a subject has an unconscious wish that p and finds herself believing p because of it.  She later discovers good evidence for p, which she can articulate.  If occurrent awareness is not required, won\u2019t we mistakenly count her belief as based on epistemic reasons even though its actual basis was wishful thinking?\n\nResponse: the basing relation is explanatory, not post-hoc rationalisation.  For the belief to be epistemically based on R, R must play the right causal-rational role at t, not merely be available later.  In the hunch case the causal route bypasses R.  Had we filmed the cognitive etiology, R would not show up; therefore DAP with its explanatory condition (a) does not confer justification.\n\n6.2 The Swamping Problem.  If reliability or reason-responsiveness suffices, why should we value conscious reflection at all?  Does the view not trivialise epistemic responsibility?\n\nResponse: conscious awareness strengthens epistemic status in at least two ways.  First, it widens the domain of reasons one can bring to bear, thus enhancing sensitivity to defeating evidence.  Second, awareness grounds second-order knowledge that one\u2019s belief is justified, a valuable good beyond first-order truth.  What the argument shows is not that reflection is useless but that it refines rather than creates justificatory basing.\n\n6.3 The Phenomenology of Seeming.  According to Phenomenal Conservatism, the \u201cseeming that p\u201d is itself a conscious, sui generis reason.  If so, how can unconscious reasons justify?\n\nResponse: even if seemings are reasons, they are not the only reasons.  Background beliefs, memory contents and inferential transitions often lack accompanying seemings yet clearly function as reasons.  Moreover, seemings themselves may have sub-personal precursors that do the justificatory heavy lifting.  The fact that some reasons are phenomenally present does not entail that all must be.\n\n6.4 Eliminativist Concerns.  Might not the talk of \u201cunconscious reasons\u201d collapse into mere causal explanations, draining the normative notion of \u2018reason\u2019 of its force?\n\nResponse: the normative force is preserved by tying rational basing to functional sensitivity to epistemic norms\u2014truth, consistency, evidential support.  Sub-personal modules that update beliefs in a Bayes-optimal fashion are not merely causal pathways; they instantiate abstract norms of rationality.  By contrast, wishful-thinking modules fail that test and so do not confer justification.  The difference is not purely causal but normative: one kind of process tracks objective evidential relations, the other does not.\n\n7. The Role of Automatic, Modular Processes  \n\nJerry Fodor famously argued that modules are cognitively impenetrable.  If so, how can they integrate reasons at all?  The answer lies in distinguishing two varieties of cognitive penetration: semantic uptake versus top-down revision.  A module can encode probabilistic relations between stimulus and distal states that constitute \u201creasons\u201d in an internal language even if its operations are insulated from background theory.  The visual system\u2019s assignment of 0.9 posterior probability to \u201cthere is a table\u201d given a pattern of retinal stimulation is a paradigmatically epistemic computation: it is sensitive to the evidential relevance of the stimulus to the distal proposition.  Insulation from folk-theoretic beliefs does not preclude rationality; it merely makes it automatic.\n\nOnce the output of such a module is tokened in central cognition, the subject is in a position, given the right queries, to cite the output as a reason.  The dispositional accessibility is thus secured by the interface between module and central thought.\n\n8. Comparison with Externalist Accounts  \n\nReliabilism.  The present view shares with reliabilism the denial that occurrent awareness is necessary, but diverges by insisting on a genuine reasons-explanation.  A clairvoyant\u2019s true belief formed by an unreliable but in fact truth-conductive faculty (e.g., barn\u2010fa\u00e7ade cases) fails to be justified, because it is insulated from evidential reasons; the subject lacks even the disposition to tie the belief to the relevant evidence.  DAP thus avoids the objection that bare reliability swamps normative force.\n\nVirtue Epistemology.  On John Greco\u2019s or Ernest Sosa\u2019s virtue theory, justification (or \u2018apt\u2019 belief) requires that the belief arise from an intellectual virtue competently aimed at truth.  Our account can be recast as a virtue theory where the virtue consists in reason-responsive dispositions, some conscious, some not.  The difference is mostly terminological: we emphasise the explanatory role of considerations that count in favour of the proposition, whereas virtue theorists foreground the agent\u2019s reliable intellectual character.\n\n9. The Gradient of Justification  \n\nThe position sketched allows a gradient:\n\nLevel 0: Mere true belief produced by brute causation (e.g., randomly stimulated neurons) \u2014 no justification.\n\nLevel 1: Belief produced by sub-personal processes that track evidential relations and to which the agent is at least dispositionally sensitive \u2014 basic justification.\n\nLevel 2: Level-1 plus partial occurrent awareness of some reasons \u2014 enhanced justification, greater resistance to defeat.\n\nLevel 3: Full reflective endorsement after critical scrutiny \u2014 reflective knowledge or wisdom.\n\nOnly Level 0 entirely lacks justificatory basing; Level 1 suffices for being justified, contrary to SAP.  Reflection elevates rather than initiates epistemic standing.\n\n10. Conclusion  \n\nWe began with a puzzle: does the absence of conscious awareness annul epistemic basing?  The strict awareness principle offers a simple, elegant answer but fails to respect the phenomenology of ordinary cognition, the findings of cognitive science, and the epistemic lives of children and animals.  Once we separate the explanatory notion of rational basing from the evidential role of reflective access, we can preserve the core insight of internalism\u2014responsiveness to reasons\u2014without the over-demanding requirement of occurrent awareness.  Dispositional awareness provides the needed bridge: a subject justifiably believes when her cognitive system is engineered to track and respond to genuine reasons, reasons she could in principle bring to the surface should circumstances call for it.  \n\nThus, automatic modular processes can and often do supply genuine epistemic grounding.  Conscious reflection remains philosophically and practically valuable, but it refines rather than bestows justification.  The terrain of epistemic responsibility is therefore broader than the spotlight of consciousness, extending into the dim but orderly backstage where perception, memory and inference do most of their work unseen.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 13, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 3493, "reasoning_tokens": 448}

Introduction  \n\nIf I glance out of the window and immediately judge that it is raining, my visual experience is caused by sensory stimulation, processed by numerous sub-personal and largely automatic computational stages. I do not rehearse any explicit argument of the form \u2018There are falling streaks, overcast sky, muffled sound\u2026; therefore it is raining\u2019. Yet my belief strikes us as epistemically unobjectionable; it is based on the good, rain-indicating reasons delivered by perception. A natural thought follows: conscious awareness of one\u2019s reasons cannot be necessary for a belief to be epistemically based on them, otherwise nearly all perceptual knowledge \u2013 and much everyday reasoning \u2013 would be relegated to the non-epistemic.  \n\nSome epistemologists demur. They claim that for S\u2019s mental state M to be *epistemically based* on a set of reasons R, S must at least be *consciously aware* of R, perhaps in an occurrent manner. Call this the Awareness Requirement (AR). They motivate AR by appeals to intellectual responsibility and to the phenomenology of basing: if a belief is a rational response to a reason, doesn\u2019t the subject have to *appreciate* that very rationale? Otherwise, one fears, the \u2018\u2018link\u2019\u2019 between reason and belief is merely causal; the belief might be lucky, or alienated from the subject\u2019s rational agency.  \n\nModular, automatic cognitive processes \u2013 perceptual modules, language parsing, implicit statistical learning, \u2018\u2018System 1\u2019\u2019 heuristics \u2013 threaten AR. These processes seem to produce beliefs and judgments in virtue of evidential relations they track, while keeping their operative reasons below the level of consciousness. Is such *subpersonal* reliance on reasons enough for epistemic basing, or does the lack of conscious access rob these outputs of justificatory status?  \n\nIn what follows I argue for five claims:  \n\n1. A strict Awareness Requirement is too demanding; lack of contemporaneous conscious awareness does not in general preclude epistemic basing.  \n2. Nonetheless, conscious awareness plays an important *regulative* role: a belief can be epistemically based on R only if R are, in normal conditions, *poised* for conscious uptake \u2013 that is, they are available for attention through ordinary reflective effort.  \n3. This availability condition preserves the core insights of AR (the link to rational responsibility) while accommodating the epistemic legitimacy of automatic, modular processes.  \n4. The resulting view explains central data: perceptual knowledge, expert intuition, and pathological cases (e.g., blindsight, implicit bias) that intuitively lack full justification.  \n5. Finally, I reply to objections that my proposal collapses into pure reliabilism or into a deflationary \u2018\u2018dispositional\u2019\u2019 account of justification.  \n\nThe dialectic is thus conciliatory: consciousness is not required in order to *have* epistemic basing, but *accessibility to consciousness* is required in order for basing to be *fully one\u2019s own*.  \n\n2. Clarifying the terrain  \n\n2.1. Basing versus having a reason  \n\nEpistemologists distinguish *propositional* from *doxastic* justification. S has propositional justification for p when S possesses good reasons R, even if S fails to base the belief that p on R; S has doxastic justification when S\u2019s belief that p is properly based on R. The present debate concerns the nature of this basing relation.  \n\n2.2. Varieties of awareness  \n\n\u2018Conscious awareness\u2019 admits of gradations:  \na. Occurrent attention: S is actively thinking about R.  \nb. Standing conscious availability: R is within the \u2018\u2018fringe\u2019\u2019 of phenomenology, ready to be brought to focal attention.  \nc. Introspective recognisability: upon reflection S can recall or articulate R.  \n\nAdvocates of AR typically insist on (a) or at least (b); critics often concede only (c).  \n\n2.3. Subpersonal reasons  \n\nAutomatic modules can encode probabilistic regularities and generate outputs that mirror good epistemic practice \u2013 e.g., the visual system integrates light cues to infer shape and depth. The operative \u2018\u2018reasons\u2019\u2019 here are not line-by-line premises but informational states functioning as evidence within the system. The question is whether such subpersonal evidential dependencies can confer *personal-level* justification.  \n\n3. Against a strict Awareness Requirement  \n\n3.1. The Perception-First Argument  \n\nMost of our beliefs about the immediate environment are formed perceptually without explicit reflection. If AR were true, we would lack justification for the bulk of our everyday knowledge. That consequence is implausible. One might bite the bullet, saying that \u2018\u2018strict justification\u2019\u2019 is rare. Yet ordinary language, epistemic practice, and scientific inquiry suggest otherwise: we treat perceptual beliefs as paradigmatically justified, unless defeated.  \n\n3.2. The Expertise Argument  \n\nChess masters instantaneously recognize that a position is hopeless. Years of pattern-learning supply their reasons, but they do not consciously rehearse them; such reflection would even impair performance. Still, their verdict is epistemically creditable, unlike the random hunch of a novice. The natural explanation appeals to implicit, evidence-sensitive mechanisms shaped by long practice.  \n\n3.3. The Cognitive Load Argument  \n\nWorking memory is limited (perhaps four chunks). If conscious rehearsal of every reason were required, human epistemic agents would grind to a halt. Any plausible epistemology for finite creatures must respect such cognitive constraints.  \n\n3.4. The Alienation Worry can be defanged  \n\nAR proponents press the worry that absent awareness, the belief-reason link is merely causal, not genuinely rational. But the underlying intuition is that the subject must retain *control* over her cognitive life. Yet control need not involve explicit endorsement; it is enough that the processes producing the belief are *her* processes, responsive to her epistemic environment, and modifiable through normative feedback. Habitual, well-integrated dispositions can manifest agency without consciousness on every occasion, just as skilled movements (cycling, typing) express practical agency without attention to each muscle contraction.  \n\n4. The role of accessibility: a middle path  \n\nWhile rejecting strict AR, we should not swing to a radical externalism where any reliable causal chain suffices for basing. Consider blindsight. A patient guesses \u2018\u2018there is an X on the screen\u2019\u2019 with 80 % accuracy, guided by visual information unavailable to consciousness. Intuitively, such guesses are not fully justified, because the patient has no way to *endorse, check, or integrate* the basis. Similarly, implicit racial biases track crude statistical generalisations but fail epistemically.  \n\nThese data suggest that conscious capacities matter, not for every token act of cognition, but for *normative governance*. The following condition captures this:  \n\nAccessible Reasons Condition (ARC): S\u2019s belief that p is epistemically based on R only if, for each r in R, r is, in normal circumstances, available for conscious endorsement after minimal reflective effort by S.  \n\nARC allows subpersonal mechanisms to generate beliefs, yet anchors justification in the subject\u2019s potential to bring those grounds to consciousness if needed \u2013 e.g., when challenged. Accessibility, unlike occurrent awareness, does not overload cognitive resources; it suffices that the information is stored in working or long-term memory in a retrievable form, or is easily re-derivable.  \n\n5. How ARC accommodates the datum cases  \n\n5.1. Ordinary Perception  \n\nIf asked, \u2018\u2018Why think it\u2019s raining?\u2019\u2019 I can attend to my experience: \u2018\u2018I see raindrops on the pane and wet pavement.\u2019\u2019 The reasons were not occurrent, but they were available.  \n\n5.2. Expert Intuitions  \n\nA chess grandmaster may initially say \u2018\u2018I just see it\u2019s lost,\u2019\u2019 but upon limited reflection she can cite pattern-based reasons: \u2018\u2018If I try 1\u2026Qd7, the knight fork on f6 is decisive\u2026.\u2019\u2019 Her unconscious recognition is grounded in knowledge she can, within limits, articulate.  \n\n5.3. Blindsight  \n\nThe patient lacks such accessibility. When queried, she disavows any visual reason. Hence her accurate guess, though reliably produced, lacks doxastic justification.  \n\n5.4. Implicit Bias  \n\nA hiring manager\u2019s snap judgment that the male candidate is more competent is not backed by information she can responsibly endorse. Confronted, she offers no epistemic reason but perhaps realises the influence of stereotype. The belief fails ARC.  \n\n6. Advantages of ARC  \n\n6.1. Responsibility and Critique  \n\nARC preserves the interpersonal norm of asking \u2018\u2018Why?\u2019\u2019 Justified believers must *be able* to supply reasons on demand, anchoring rational responsibility.  \n\n6.2. Compatibility with Modular Science  \n\nARC imposes no bar on modular processing; it merely requires that the modules feed their outputs into a cognitive architecture where the evidence can, in principle, rise to consciousness. Cognitive science already models perception as \u2018\u2018globally broadcast\u2019\u2019 once selected; ARC is a philosophical corollary.  \n\n6.3. Gradability  \n\nJustification may come in degrees, and accessibility can be partial. The more effortlessly and thoroughly reasons can be made conscious, the stronger the justification. Expert hunches fare better than novice hunches; blindsight worse still.  \n\n7. Objections and replies  \n\nObjection 1: ARC collapses into pure reliabilism, because \u2018\u2018availability\u2019\u2019 is itself cashed out behaviorally (can S report r?) \u2013 a causal-dispositional matter.  \n\nReply: Availability is *not* mere reliability. A disposition to deliver r into consciousness is a conceptual, not purely statistical, property. It links justificatory status to the architecture of rational self-governance, not to truth-conduciveness alone. One can imagine reliable but in-principle inaccessible processes (e.g., a brain implant with no interface); ARC withholds justification here, unlike reliabilism.  \n\nObjection 2: ARC is too weak; subjects could always attempt to confabulate reasons post-hoc.  \n\nReply: Confabulations are not genuine retrievals of the operative reasons. Empirical work on split-brain patients shows such fabrications diverge from underlying causes, and interlocutors can expose the mismatch (via counter-questioning, tracking response times, etc.). ARC demands that the actual justificatory grounds be *there to be found*, not invented ad hoc.  \n\nObjection 3: The view makes justification hostage to cognitive limitations. Suppose a normally sighted person forms a true belief from a brief glimpse but subsequently suffers amnesia and can no longer recall the perceptual grounds. On ARC, does the belief lose justification retroactively?  \n\nReply: Two distinctions help. First, doxastic justification is time-indexed; what is justified at t1 may lose justification at t2 if defeaters arise, including loss of access to grounds. Second, residual phenomenal memory may still serve as an available reason (\u2018\u2018I distinctly remember seeing\u2026\u2019\u2019). Where even that is gone, continued entitlement may indeed fade; this aligns with ordinary practice \u2013 we trust memories more when we can remember *when and how* they arose.  \n\n8. Toward a broader epistemology of consciousness  \n\nThe debate illuminates a general thesis: consciousness matters in epistemology not because every justified belief must be introspectively transparent, but because consciousness enables *cognitive integration*. It is the arena where reasons can be pooled, assessed, revised, and shared. Automatic modules feed this arena. Without their silent labour, we would be blind; without the arena\u2019s oversight, we would be irresponsibly led.  \n\nThe resulting picture is pluralistic:  \n\n\u2022 Subpersonal evidential sensitivities generate candidate beliefs.  \n\u2022 Personal-level accessibility confers epistemic basing.  \n\u2022 Social practices of challenge and answer install further norms (public articulation, peer review).  \n\nOne might compare this to virtue reliabilism supplemented by an *aptness* condition: a belief is knowledge only if produced by competences *and* not defeated by the subject\u2019s inability to vouch for their operation when appropriate.  \n\n9. Conclusion  \n\nDoes lack of conscious awareness of one\u2019s reasons preclude epistemic basing? Strictly, no. Requiring occurrent awareness would strip perception, skilled intuition, and much everyday reasoning of justification. Yet some link to consciousness is indispensable if beliefs are to be genuinely *ours* in the space of reasons. The compromise I have defended \u2013 that a subject must have *potential conscious access* to the reasons on which her belief subpersonally depends \u2013 preserves both the cognitive science of modularity and the philosophical demand for accountable rational agency.  \n\nAccordingly, the epistemic status of beliefs produced by automatic processes is hostage not to whether the subject is, hic et nunc, contemplating her grounds, but to whether she *could* do so with normal reflective effort. Conscious awareness is thus not the origin, but the steward, of epistemic basing.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 14, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 2940, "reasoning_tokens": 256}

However, this characterization seems imprecise. What is the actual relationship between scientific objectivity and trust, and can we provide a more precise account of what unifies the different senses of objectivity?", "answer": "1. Introduction: \u2018Objectivity\u2019 and the rhetoric of trust  \n\nAlmost everyone who writes on scientific objectivity now grants that the term has many meanings. A historian may talk of \u201cobjective measurements,\u201d a statistician of \u201cobjective priors,\u201d a philosopher of \u201cobjective knowledge,\u201d and a sociologist of \u201cobjectivity as social interaction.\u201d Arthur Fine, Heather Douglas, Lorraine Daston & Peter Galison, Helen Longino and Ian Hacking have each proposed partial typologies. In the best-known current taxonomy three families stand out.\n\n\u2022 Procedural objectivity: the use of impersonal, rule-governed techniques (standardised instruments, double-blind trials, explicit coding protocols) that allegedly allow \u201cthe facts to speak for themselves.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Convergent objectivity (sometimes \u201cevidential\u201d or \u201ccausal\u201d objectivity): independent avenues of evidence all point to the same conclusion, or the same mathematical structure reappears in diverse phenomena. Convergence promises robustness.\n\n\u2022 Interactive or social objectivity: data and claims are subjected to open criticism by differently situated inquirers who can expose each other\u2019s blind spots; bias is canceled through organised contestation.\n\nDespite their differences, Fine and Douglas propose an arresting slogan: each form of objectivity \u201csignals that the result can be trusted.\u201d As Fine puts it, \u201cobjectivity is our mark for what is reliably so; we invoke it to settle disagreements by asserting the trustworthiness of the upshot.\u201d Douglas writes: \u201cObjectivity is not an end in itself; it is valuable because it establishes the grounds on which we may place warranted trust in scientific claims.\u201d  \n\nThe slogan is attractive but also slippery. Trust is a psychological attitude or a normative stance that subjects take; objectivity is supposed to be a property of scientific products or practices. Saying only that \u201cobjectivity means we can trust the claim\u201d leaves open (i) what exactly must be trusted\u2014people, instruments, processes, or results; (ii) what makes such trust reasonable rather than blind faith; and (iii) why quite different senses of objectivity should all converge on the same sort of warrant. My task is two-fold: (1) to clarify the relation between objectivity and trust, and (2) to offer a more precise feature that unifies the various senses of objectivity. I will argue that:\n\nA. Objectivity does not reduce to trust, yet its raison d\u2019\u00eatre is to make a certain posture of epistemic trust rationally permissible. Objectivity provides impersonal assurances that obviate the need for personal trust in any particular scientist; it is, as Thomas Nagel once said, \u201cthe view from nowhere\u201d instituted by material and social machinery rather than by individual virtue.\n\nB. What unifies the several kinds of objectivity is not merely \u201ctrustworthiness\u201d but a deeper structural property: counterfactual robustness with respect to perspective. A claim is objective insofar as it would remain stable across a range of admissible changes in the epistemic subject\u2014changes of individual identity, idiosyncratic preference, social location, instrumental technique, or evidential pathway. Procedural, convergent and interactive objectivity are different strategies for engineering such robustness; when they succeed, rational agents are entitled to place default trust in the outcome.\n\nThe rest of the essay develops this position. I begin with a brief conceptual analysis of trust (\u00a72), then show why scientific practice requires a special, impersonal form of trust (\u00a73). I next examine the three varieties of objectivity in the light of counterfactual robustness (\u00a74-6) and show how that notion sharpens Fine\u2019s and Douglas\u2019s slogan (\u00a77). I close with some objections and replies (\u00a78) and a conclusion (\u00a79).\n\n2. What is trust?  \n\nPhilosophers of trust (e.g., Karen Jones, Annette Baier, Richard Holton, Katherine Hawley) normally treat \u2018trust\u2019 as a three-place relation: A (the truster) trusts B (the trustee) with respect to \u03c6 (some matter)\u2014typically on the expectation that B is both competent and committed to perform \u03c6 without opportunistically exploiting A\u2019s vulnerability. Trust thus combines cognitive expectation, affective openness, and normative entitlement. Crucially:\n\n\u2022 Trust is not mere reliance. I rely on my computer to boot up, but I do not trust it in the moral sense because the computer cannot take responsibility. Similarly, a scientist may rely on a thermometer without trusting it; she trusts the calibration authority behind it.\n\n\u2022 Trust is personal or socially mediated. One trusts people, or systems that stand in for people (professional standards authorities, regulatory agencies, peer reviewers), because they display integrity, competence, and accountability.\n\n\u2022 Trust always involves vulnerability. If the trustee defaults, the truster is exposed to risk that she cannot fully hedge.\n\nScientific knowledge is a distributed, collaborative enterprise in which no individual can replicate the entire evidential chain. Consequently, scientists and lay publics alike are forced into a posture of epistemic dependence. As John Hardwig famously argued, modern science is \u201cwholesale epistemic dependence\u201d on the testimony of others. The role of objectivity, I shall argue, is to transform that unavoidable dependence into warranted trust by designing practices that diminish the kinds of vulnerability that attach to purely personal testimony.\n\n3. The need for impersonal trust in science  \n\nSuppose I read in Nature that a neutrino has a non-zero mass. I cannot rerun the experiments at Super-Kamiokande; I probably cannot even understand the raw data formats. My epistemic position is mediated through:\n\na. Instrument\u2010based procedures, standards of error analysis, and statistical testing.  \nb. Institutional safeguards\u2014peer review, replication attempts, editorial scrutiny.  \nc. A background culture of scientific norms\u2014Mertonian communism, organized skepticism, transparency.\n\nAll three jointly give me reason to trust the reported result. Yet my trust is not in Dr. Kajita personally; it is trust in the \u201cobjective\u201d system that produced and vetted the claim. This fact motivates Fine\u2019s and Douglas\u2019s thesis: objectivity functions socially as an entitlement-conferring label. Still, saying only that \u201cobjectivity grounds trust\u201d leaves unanswered why such trust is justified. One frequent answer\u2014\u201cBecause objectivity removes biases\u201d\u2014is too blunt. Different senses of objectivity manage different kinds of bias, and sometimes they even conflict (strict adherence to a protocol may hinder critical interaction). We need a unifying feature that explains why each practice, when it works, supports default epistemic trust.\n\n4. Counterfactual robustness: a unifying conception  \n\nMy proposal is that scientific objectivity, in all its flavors, aims at counterfactual robustness with respect to perspective. Put schematically:\n\nA claim C is objective relative to a domain D if and only if: had we varied the perspective P of the inquirer within a certain admissible range R (different persons, instruments, assumptions, social positions), C would still have obtained.\n\nRobustness here is a modal property: the result is stably insensitive to perturbations that are plausibly regarded as epistemically irrelevant. Because personal idiosyncrasies, local value judgments, hidden biases, and measurement quirks are among the primary sources of error, a result that is robust under their alternation is one we may rationally trust.\n\nThis way of putting things echoes Reichenbach\u2019s \u201cprinciple of common cause,\u201d Wimsatt\u2019s robustness analysis, and also structural realism. More recently, philosophers such as Elliott Sober and Sandra Mitchell have used robustness as a marker of evidential strength. My claim is that robustness is not merely a confirmatory virtue; it is the common denominator that explains why quite distinct methodological devices are all called \u201cobjectivity-enhancing.\u201d Let me show how it operates in each family of objectivity.\n\n5. Procedural objectivity as impersonation  \n\nProcedural objectivity was celebrated by 19th-century metrologists, by Daston\u2019s \u201cmechanical objectivity,\u201d and by Karl Pearson\u2019s biometricians: follow a strict protocol so that \u201ca train an imbecile could operate\u201d would deliver the same reading as a genius. The idea is to purge the result of dependence on personal judgment. In my terms: the admissible range R of subject perspectives includes differences in skill, honesty, and interpretive discretion. A protocol rigid enough to guarantee the same output across that range secures counterfactual robustness; the result no longer rides on who did the measuring. Hence third parties may trust it without inquiring into the measurer\u2019s virtues. Of course, as critics note, procedural objectivity can fail when the protocol encodes a bias or encounters unforeseen phenomena. Nevertheless, when successful its epistemic virtue derives exactly from making the output invariant to individual vagaries.\n\n6. Convergent objectivity as evidential intersection  \n\nConvergence objectivity\u2014multiple independent lines of evidence point to the electron\u2019s charge, continental drift, or the Higgs boson\u2014fits the same template. Here the varied \u201cperspectives\u201d are different investigative routes: cloud chambers, spectral measurements, scattering cross-sections. If they all converge on e = \u22121.602\u00d710^\u221219 C, the claim is robust across those counterfactual variations. This diminishes the likelihood that some hidden assumption common to all methods drives the result; hence it is trustworthy. Philosophers from Duhem to Wimsatt have insisted that robustness does not prove truth, but it sharply lowers the risk that a single pathway\u2019s idiosyncratic bias has misled us. In trust terminology, convergence spreads the epistemic risk so that no single potential betrayal or blunder would overturn the claim.\n\n7. Interactive objectivity as social symmetry  \n\nHelen Longino, Philip Kitcher, and Douglas herself defend interactive objectivity: expose claims to the critical scrutiny of differently situated observers whose perspectives embody diverse values and background assumptions. Feminist standpoint theory adds that inclusion of marginalised perspectives is epistemically potent. Again, the rationale is robustness: if the claim survives interrogation by people with different epistemic and social standpoints, it is less sensitive to any single standpoint\u2019s blind spots. The \u201cadmissible range R\u201d now includes gender, ethnicity, economic interest, and theoretical orientation. Interactive objectivity thus extends invariance across sociocultural variations, corroborating the result\u2019s trustworthiness for a wider public.\n\n8. How robustness underwrites rational trust  \n\nWe can now refine Fine\u2019s and Douglas\u2019s slogan.\n\n(1) Scientific practices are objective when they engineer counterfactual robustness against variations that are epistemically irrelevant but plausibly risk-laden.  \n(2) Outputs of such practices warrant a distinctive epistemic stance: entitled de-personalised trust. A downstream user may rely on the result without vetting the character or motives of each contributor, because the methodological design has already neutralised those personal factors.\n\nThis picture clarifies the relation between objectivity and trust:\n\n\u2022 Objectivity is a property of epistemic products and processes (a modal, perspective-independence property).  \n\u2022 Trust is a second-order attitude that recipients may adopt toward those products because they possess that property.  \n\u2022 Therefore objectivity is the institutional substitute for personal trust; it is trust-relieving as well as trust-grounding.\n\n9. Objections and replies  \n\nObjection 1: Robustness across perspectives might occur by accident; it is not sufficient for truth.  \n\nReply: True, robustness is fallible. But objectivity never guaranteed infallibility; it guarantees only a certain kind of resilience. What robustness provides is a defeasible but heightened warrant for trust, better than the alternative of idiosyncratic dependence.\n\nObjection 2: Some biases are systematic across ostensibly independent methods (e.g., value-laden operationalisations). Then convergence fails to detect them.  \n\nReply: That diagnosis reinforces my point. When systematic biases are suspected, the admissible range R must be expanded\u2014inviting new standpoints, inventing foreign instruments, or altering background assumptions. Each historical expansion (e.g., inclusion of feminist perspectives in primatology) reveals that robustness is context-dependent yet still unifying.\n\nObjection 3: The replication crisis in psychology shows that procedural rules and peer review failed; does that not undermine the trust-objectivity link?  \n\nReply: The crisis demonstrates what happens when objectivity-securing mechanisms are inadequate. Preregistration, open data, better statistics are exactly attempts to restore robustness (invariance across analytic choices, labs, time) and thereby rational trust. Failure cases illustrate the norm.\n\nObjection 4: What about strongly theory-laden perception? If all observation is concept-laden, there is no perspective-invariant \u201cfact.\u201d  \n\nReply: My claim concerns invariance across permissible differences in perspective, not independence from all conceptual schemes. The relevant comparison class is rival perspectives within our actual epistemic community. If after adjusting for theory-ladenness we still obtain convergence or procedural impersonality, objectivity is achieved in the only sense available to finite agents.\n\n10. Conclusion  \n\nFine and Douglas are right that objectivity is intimately tied to trust, but the link must be articulated carefully. Trust is an attitude; objectivity is a structural feature that makes that attitude rational. The unifying structural feature is counterfactual robustness with respect to perspective: a claim or dataset is objective to the extent that it would persist under specified variations in the epistemic subject or her pathway to the result. Procedural, convergent, and interactive objectivity are not rival conceptions but complementary engineering solutions to the robustness problem. They earn our rational, default trust by insulating the product from the contingencies\u2014and the potential betrayals\u2014of individual actors. Thus what unifies scientific objectivity is not merely the social function of commanding deference but the modal condition that renders such deference epistemically responsible.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 0, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 3564, "reasoning_tokens": 704}

However, this characterization seems imprecise. What is the actual relationship between scientific objectivity and trust, and can we provide a more precise account of what unifies the different senses of objectivity?", "answer": "1. Introduction  \n\nFew words in the philosophy of science have been more protean than \u201cobjectivity.\u201d  Its normative force is obvious\u2014scientific results ought to be objective\u2014but its exact meaning is elusive.  In recent decades philosophers such as Arthur Fine and Heather Douglas have floated a unifying slogan: when we praise a procedure, result, or institution as \u201cobjective,\u201d we are recommending that it can be trusted.  Trust, they suggest, is the thread that binds together what otherwise look like heterogeneous senses of objectivity: procedural objectivity (rule-governed methods), convergent objectivity (agreement from multiple independent lines of evidence), and interactive objectivity (critical engagement among diverse inquirers).  The slogan is attractive, but also frustratingly imprecise.  What kind of trust is at stake?  Is trust merely a psychological response, or does it track a real epistemic property?  And\u2014most importantly\u2014does subsuming objectivity under trust illuminate or obscure the differences among the several senses?  \n\nI will argue that the trust-based slogan is partly right but in need of sharpening.  Objectivity is not identical with being trusted, nor even with being trust-worthy in the everyday moral sense.  Rather, all the recognized senses of objectivity involve a family of epistemic invariance relations: they are techniques for making the product of inquiry insensitive to certain kinds of idiosyncratic, perspectival, or interest-laden perturbations.  When an epistemic product exhibits such invariance, it rationally licenses trust.  Trust is therefore consequent to objectivity, not constitutive of it.  The unifying core is not the attitude of trust, but the structure that warrants it\u2014robustness under counterfactual variation of investigators, interests, and investigative paths.  By focusing on those invariance-conferring mechanisms we obtain a tighter, more discriminating account of the unity of objectivity while preserving the important connection with justified reliance.\n\n2. What is \u201ctrust\u201d?  \n\nPhilosophers of trust usually distinguish (a) the psychological attitude of trusting, (b) the moral trait of being trustworthy, and (c) the epistemic property of being reliably capable of delivering some good.  A child may trust a charismatic stranger (attitude) though the stranger is not trustworthy (moral trait) and definitely not reliable (epistemic property).  Fine\u2019s slogan\u2014\u201cobjective means you can trust it\u201d\u2014is ambiguous between these layers.  Heather Douglas is clearer: for her, objectivity answers the \u201cinductive risk\u201d concern by making evidence reliable enough that society may legitimately rely on it when stakes are high.  Yet even here \u201crely on\u201d is broader than believing; it shades into the practical confidence needed for policy action.  \n\nFor current purposes we should reserve \u201ctrust\u201d for a second-order stance that one agent (or community) A takes toward a testimonial source S: A assumes that S\u2019s deliverances will not systematically mislead A with respect to the domain in question.  That stance is rational only if S enjoys certain first-order properties\u2014call them trust-engendering properties.  If objectivity is to ground trust, objectivity had better be such a property, or at least strongly co-vary with it.\n\n3. The three prominent senses of objectivity  \n\na. Procedural objectivity (Daston & Galison, Porter): A result is objective insofar as it is produced by following explicit, standardized, public rules that minimize the influence of personal idiosyncrasies\u2014rules for measurement, data cleaning, statistical testing, peer review.  The microscope calibration guide and the pre-registration protocol are emblematic tools.  \n\nb. Convergent objectivity (Hacking, Worrall, Weber): An inference garners objectivity when independent lines of evidence \u201cmesh\u201d or exhibit robustness across distinct experimental and theoretical approaches.  That distant planets obey Newton\u2019s law in three independent data sets, or that the Higgs boson is glimpsed in multiple decay channels at ATLAS and CMS, secures belief by triangulation.  \n\nc. Interactive or social objectivity (Longino, Solomon, Douglas): Epistemic communities discipline individual biases by organized criticism, uptake of alternative perspectives, and vulnerability to replication.  The objectivity of a claim here is a population-level property: a claim survives because it has withstood robust critical interaction, not because each single investigator was unbiased.  \n\nThese senses look dissimilar: the first invokes rule-following impersonal machines; the second, empirical convergence; the third, democratic deliberation.  Yet all are meant to distance scientific output from the quirks, interests, and blind spots of particular inquirers.\n\n4. How Fine and Douglas mobilize trust  \n\nArthur Fine\u2019s Natural Ontological Attitude advises us to accept successful scientific claims \u201cas we find them,\u201d neither exaggeratedly justified (realism) nor unduly skeptical (antirealism).  Why accept them?  Because scientific procedures and community vetting make them \u201cobjective,\u201d hence \u201cto be trusted.\u201d  Fine does not unpack the mechanism; the claim is rhetorical.  \n\nHeather Douglas is more programmatic.  She locates objectivity in features that render science \u201cworthy of public trust,\u201d especially when value-laden decisions are at stake.  Her taxonomy\u2014value-free ideal, value-management ideal, and so on\u2014plots how different forms of objectivity minimize the morally salient risk of error.  Trust, for Douglas, is a social license to act on scientific input when lives and resources are on the line.  The explicit bridge between objectivity and policy trustworthiness is a valuable advance, but the internal unity of objectivity is left at the intuitive level of \u201cmechanisms that merit trust.\u201d\n\n5. Why \u201ctrust\u201d cannot be the unifying essence  \n\nThere are at least three problems with equating objectivity with trust-worthiness:  \n\ni. Overbreadth: Many institutions elicit rational trust without being \u201cobjective\u201d in any recognizable sense\u2014e.g., the reliability of municipal water systems or the fiduciary duty of a bank.  \u201cObjective\u201d is science-specific; \u201cworthy of trust\u201d spans the social world.  \n\nii. Redundancy: If to call a result objective is just to say one may trust it, we lose the explanatory work that \u201cobjectivity\u201d performs inside science.  We need to know which concrete arrangements make trust rational; otherwise \u201cobjective\u201d is mere applause.  \n\niii. Disconnect between attitude and property: People often place misplaced trust in charismatic pseudoscientists or collectively distrust climate science despite its objectivity.  The presence or absence of trust in the social world therefore cannot define objectivity; at best it indicates whether objectivity is publicly recognized.\n\n6. Toward a positive account: objectivity as invariance under perspective-transformations  \n\nThe heart of objectivity, I submit, is not the attitude of trust but the structural feature that makes trust rational: robustness to variation in who investigates, by which pathway, with which legitimate interests.  This can be cashed out in the language of invariance familiar from the philosophy of physics:  \n\nObjectivity = epistemic invariance across a specified set of perspective-transformations.  \n\nThe transformations in question include:  \n\u2022 Substituting one competent observer for another (personal standpoint).  \n\u2022 Altering non-arbitrary background assumptions within a recognized research program (theoretical standpoint).  \n\u2022 Employing different reliable instruments or experimental set-ups (material standpoint).  \n\u2022 Re-running the inquiry at different social sites with different distributions of interests and cognitive styles (social standpoint).  \n\nIf the truth-candidate remains stable across these transformations, the claim or datum is objective relative to that family of substitutions.  Conversely, when results swing wildly under those shifts\u2014depending, say, on which political lobby funds the lab\u2014they are non-objective or biased.\n\n7. How the three senses exemplify invariance  \n\n1. Procedural objectivity secures invariance across personal standpoint transformations.  The rulebook for measuring blood-pressure guarantees that if Nurse A is replaced by Nurse B, the reading will stay within a small tolerance.  Here the relevant transformation is \u201cidentity of the operator.\u201d  \n\n2. Convergent objectivity secures invariance across investigative-path transformations.  Replace interferometer A with interferometer B, or inferential route X with route Y; if the quantity re-appears with the same value, we have robustness.  \n\n3. Interactive objectivity secures invariance across social-perspective transformations.  Replace a research team dominated by one demographic with a heterogeneous group containing divergent values and theoretical predilections; if criticism and replication push both groups toward the same claim, the claim\u2019s survival indicates independence from any single value-laded viewpoint.  \n\nThus each sense of objectivity is a particular implementation of the general idea of perspective-invariance.  What differs is the kind of transformation held constant; what unifies them is the higher-order strategy of \u201cdistancing the result from idiosyncrasy.\u201d\n\n8. Why invariance, not merely reliability, matters  \n\nOne might wonder whether reliability alone suffices.  Suppose an exquisitely sensitive seismometer is calibrated by the idiosyncratic ear of its inventor, who alone can interpret the output.  Decades of output prove uncannily accurate.  The instrument is reliable yet objectionably non-objective: if the inventor retires, the knowledge evaporates; the accuracy is hostage to a quirky perspective.  By contrast, an objective instrument is not only reliable but also shareable\u2014its accuracy is transported intact across legitimate substitutions of observers and contexts.  Invariance captures that shareability, which underwrites the public character of science.  \n\n9. The place of trust in the picture  \n\nGiven the invariance account, trust enters naturally but secondarily.  A rational agent (or polity) ought to trust results that are demonstrably invariant under the transformations relevant to her interests and vulnerabilities.  The degree of trust should scale with the breadth and stringency of the invariance.  When Douglas says that objectivity \u201cmakes science worthy of public trust,\u201d she is correct if we read \u201cobjectivity\u201d as shorthand for \u201cinvariance across transformations the public cares about\u201d (different labs, funding sources, analytical pipelines, etc.).  But if stakeholders lack the epistemic resources to recognize that invariance, they may refuse trust.  Conversely, propagandists may simulate consensus and standardization to manufacture spurious trust.  Hence trust cannot be the essence; rather, the structural property of invariance is the normative ground, while trust is the warranted response when stakeholders are properly informed.  \n\n10. Addressing possible objections  \n\nObjection 1: Invariance relative to which transformations?  If the set is too narrow, the account trivializes; if too broad, objectivity becomes unattainable.  Response: the relevant transformations are context-sensitive and interest-relative.  Physical constants must be invariant across space-time frame; measures of economic well-being need not survive under the \u201ctransformation\u201d of Marxist vs. neoclassical modeling assumptions, unless those assumptions are legitimate within the focal policy context.  Objectivity is therefore graded: one can be objective-relative-to-T, where T is a transformation family warranted by the cognitive and moral stakes.  \n\nObjection 2: Doesn\u2019t the invariance account sneak in a value-laden decision about which perspectives count?  Yes; but that decision is itself subject to higher-order critical scrutiny.  Longino already builds such meta-critique into interactive objectivity.  The invariance framework clarifies the target: we ask whether the chosen transformations adequately represent the range of perspectives that might expose error or injustice.  \n\nObjection 3: Some domains\u2014e.g., ethnography\u2014appear indexical, sensitive to unique contexts.  Does the invariance account unfairly brand them subjective?  Not necessarily.  Even ethnographic insights can exhibit partial invariance (e.g., multiple observers concur on salient norms of a community) though they may fail to extend across all contexts.  Our notion of objectivity allows for local, domain-appropriate invariance rather than a mythical view from nowhere.  \n\n11. Practical dividends  \n\nA sharper account of objectivity aids both epistemology and science policy.  It encourages scientists to ask, \u201cWhat transformations must my claim survive to become publicly reliable?\u201d  That question drives concrete reforms: preregistration (invariance to data-mining choices), multi-site replication (invariance to sample idiosyncrasy), citizen science collaborations (invariance to professional culture).  Regulators and courts can likewise demand evidence of invariance rather than vague assurances of \u201cobjectivity.\u201d  The reproducibility crisis, for instance, can be re-described as a failure of purportedly invariant results to remain stable under independent lab transformation; the cure is to embed stronger invariance checks in publication norms.  \n\n12. Conclusion  \n\nFine and Douglas are right that objectivity earns trust, but they leap too quickly from that pragmatic upshot to a definition.  The unity of the diverse senses of objectivity lies deeper than trust: they are all techniques for manufacturing invariance\u2014making claims resilient to substitutions of persons, methods, and perspectives that could otherwise introduce error or bias.  Trust, when rational, is the psychological and social echo of that invariance.  By foregrounding the structural property, we rescue \u201cobjectivity\u201d from vagueness, preserve its plural forms, and equip ourselves with a clearer diagnostic for genuine versus counterfeit objectivity in the fraught interface between science and society.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 1, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 3450, "reasoning_tokens": 576}
{"question_id": "Koskinen-DefendingRiskAccount-2020", "question": "Several philosophers of science, including Arthur Fine and Heather Douglas, have suggested that the various applicable senses of scientific objectivity (such as procedural objectivity, convergent objectivity, and interactive objectivity) share a common basis in trust\u2014that when we call something objective, we indicate that it can be trusted. However, this characterization seems imprecise. What is the actual relationship between scientific objectivity and trust, and can we provide a more precise account of what unifies the different senses of objectivity?", "answer": "Scientific objectivity, whatever else it is, is something scientists, policy-makers and citizens continually rely on.  We trust weather forecasts, toxicity studies, and cosmological data even when we cannot replicate the numerical integrations, dissection protocols or telescope calibrations ourselves.  It is therefore tempting, as Arthur Fine (1998) and Heather Douglas (2004, 2009) do, to compress the notion of objectivity into the claim that \u201cwhat is objective is what can be trusted.\u201d  Yet the phrase risks trivializing both sides of the equation.  Not everything that happens to be trusted is objective\u2014witness popular delusions\u2014and not every objective result is automatically trusted\u2014witness climate science in some publics.  What, then, is the deeper connection?  In what follows I develop a three-part answer.\n\n1. The concept map: the multiple senses of objectivity.  \n2. Why trust is indeed central but only as a downstream attitude grounded in specific forms of epistemic warrant.  \n3. A unifying proposal: across its many senses, objectivity is best understood as the systematic provision of impersonal epistemic warrant\u2014a provision that makes trust rational for those who lack first-hand access to the inquiry.\n\nBy recasting objectivity as the impersonal warrant of claims, we retain the link to trust without collapsing one notion into the other, and we explain what the various species of objectivity share.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n1. The fragmented landscape of \u201cobjectivity\u201d\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe philosophical literature teems with taxonomies:\n\n\u2022 Procedural objectivity (Hacking; Daston & Galison): rule-following methods\u2014e.g., standardized measurement protocols\u2014designed to minimise investigators\u2019 idiosyncrasies.\n\n\u2022 Efficiency or mechanical objectivity: inscription devices, automatic recorders, statistical techniques that \u201clet nature speak\u201d with minimum human mediation.\n\n\u2022 Convergent objectivity (Wimsatt; Chang): the robustness of a claim under diverse independent modes of detection or representation.\n\n\u2022 Interactive or social objectivity (Longino; Douglas): critical discussion within a suitably structured community that subjects hypotheses to varied perspectives and discerns background value influences.\n\n\u2022 Ontological objectivity (Searle, Bhaskar): facts being mind-independent.\n\nEach sense grew out of concrete scientific episodes: photography in 19th-century biology, randomised controlled trials in epidemiology, or consensus reports in climate science.  The diversity has led some philosophers (Beatty, Mitchell) to treat \u201cobjectivity\u201d as an essentially contested concept or a family-resemblance term \u00e0 la Wittgenstein.\n\nFine and Douglas respond differently.  Rather than despair of unification, they locate the heart of objectivity in its social payoff: it earns our trust.  Douglas writes: \u201cobjectivity is the capacity of science to be trustworthy in the sense that we can rely on its results for our beliefs and our policies.\u201d  Fine\u2019s \u201cCore Trust Thesis\u201d likewise translates \u201cobjective\u201d into \u201cdependable.\u201d\n\nWhat is right about this stance is its acknowledgment that objectivity matters only in so far as it settles the practical question: should we rely on these findings?  What is insufficient is its failure to explain the graded, defeasible, and practice-specific nature of that reliance.  To see this, we need to clarify what philosophers of knowledge call \u201cwarrant.\u201d\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n2. From trust to warrant: the missing middle term\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n2.1 Trust as a second-order attitude\n\nTrust is a social-epistemic relation: A trusts B (or B\u2019s product) regarding p when A is disposed to act on p while foregoing independent verification, because A takes B to be both competent and sincere with respect to p.  Trust thus presupposes a gap in direct control; it is second-order confidence.  In science, the gap is enormous: no individual can personally check the entire chain from raw data to model output.  Hence any workable conception of objectivity must explain why such delegation is rational.\n\n2.2 Warrant as the rational basis for trust\n\nCall warrant the set of reasons that would justify treating a claim as reliable.  Some warrants are first-person (I looked and saw), others are impersonal (anybody following the protocol would obtain similar results; independent labs already did).  Trust becomes reasonable only when the trusting agent possesses at least defeasible evidence that adequate warrant exists.\n\nIf objectivity is equated with trust simpliciter, we miss this mediating notion of warrant.  We would also mischaracterise partisan attitudes: climate sceptics withhold trust not because atmospheric measurements lack warrant but because they (mistakenly) doubt its existence.  Objectivity is therefore not identical with trust; rather, it is a property of an inquiry or output such that the presence of warrant is public, checkable, and in principle transferable.  Call this \u201cimpersonal warrant.\u201d\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n3. Unifying the varieties: objectivity as impersonal warrant\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI now argue that each familiar sense of objectivity can be described as a strategy for generating or displaying impersonal warrant, i.e., warrant whose force does not depend on idiosyncratic features of particular producers or audiences.  The strategies differ in the sources of epistemic risk they target, but they fit one template:\n\n   Objectivity-strategy S is a regulated practice that neutralises or manages a class of epistemic liabilities L, thereby producing outputs X that possess impersonal warrant W with respect to some question Q.\n\nBy isolating the liabilities L, we see what justifies trust, and we can explain why different senses of objectivity are complementary rather than competing.\n\n3.1 Procedural objectivity  \n\nLiability addressed: variability due to individual skill, bias or imagination.  \nStrategy: codify operations into explicit rules or instruments; enable \u201ctrained non-experts\u201d to obtain the same results.  \nResulting warrant: anyone who competently follows the procedure can reproduce the data; thus reliability no longer hinges on the original investigator\u2019s character.  Impersonality is secured by protocol.\n\n3.2 Mechanical objectivity  \n\nLiability: the tendency of human observers to select, embellish or distort.  \nStrategy: use self-registering apparatuses (photographic plates, automatic spectrometers) or algorithmic filters; interposition of a \u201cmechanical witness.\u201d  \nWarrant: the inscription is produced by known physical principles indifferent to experimenter expectations.  Even a sceptic may rerun the device and compare traces.  Trust is rational because testimonial dependence on persons is replaced by dependence on stable device physics.\n\n3.3 Convergent (robustness) objectivity  \n\nLiability: model-specific or instrument-specific artefacts.  \nStrategy: measure the same magnitude via diverse theoretical frameworks, experimental setups, or data sources; attend to invariance in results.  \nWarrant: error structures uncorrelated across methods cancel; agreement furnishes public evidence that the signal is not an artefact of any single technique.  Impersonality arises because each method functions as a check on the others.\n\n3.4 Interactive / social objectivity  \n\nLiability: unnoticed background assumptions, value influences, selective uptake of evidence confined to homogeneous groups.  \nStrategy: organise a community with heterogeneous perspectives, free criticism, reproducibility norms, conflict of interest disclosures.  The Longino-Douglas focus on \u201ccritical uptake\u201d fits here.  \nWarrant: no single standpoint monopolises evaluation; potential errors due to parochial values are exposed.  Trust is rational because epistemic responsibility is distributed and visible.\n\n3.5 Ontological objectivity of the target  \n\nLiability: interpretive projection\u2014confusing what is true about the world with features of our conceptual scheme.  \nStrategy: seek invariants under legitimate transformations of scheme or perspective (e.g., special relativity\u2019s spacetime interval, cross-cultural validations in anthropology).  \nWarrant: when a property is invariant, its attribution is not an artefact of any particular representation.  Hence others, adopting different conceptual resources, can in principle recover the same relational structure.  Again, impersonality is key.\n\nOn this view, objectivity is unified not by a shared material mechanism but by a functional role: to supply publicly defensible grounds that license epistemic deference.  The plural strategies reflect plural threats to such grounds.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n4. Advantages of the impersonal-warrant account\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n4.1 Explains degrees and domains\n\nBecause liabilities vary in salience, objectivity is graded: a finding may be \u201cprocedurally objective\u201d yet still vulnerable to unrecognised background values; or it may be robust across labs but rest on a questionable mechanistic model.  The warrant framework accommodates the gradations\u2014each additional strategy removes further liabilities, augmenting rational trust.\n\n4.2 Separates sociological fact from normative status\n\nPeople sometimes trust astrology; sociologically, there is trust, but warrant is absent.  Conversely, some publics distrust vaccines despite robust warrant.  By decoupling the property (objective-as-warrant) from the attitude (trust), we make room for both misallocated trust and unwarranted scepticism.\n\n4.3 Provides action guidance\n\nScientists asking \u201cHow can we make these data objective?\u201d can interpret the question as \u201cWhich liabilities might undermine impersonal warrant here, and what strategies remove them?\u201d  This matches laboratory practice: adding blind analysis, preregistering protocols, or convening multi-stakeholder review panels.\n\n4.4 Grounds policy\n\nRegulators and courts routinely demand \u201cobjective evidence.\u201d  Our account implies they should look for documented warrant-strategies: e.g., double-blind trials (procedural), multi-species toxicology (convergent), open peer review (interactive).  The rhetoric of \u201cobjectivity\u201d becomes operational rather than talismanic.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n5. Possible objections and replies\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nObjection 1: The account is circular\u2014warrant is just whatever makes trust rational, so we have defined objectivity as what makes objectivity rational.\n\nReply: The circularity dissolves once we spell out liabilities and strategies independently identified by epistemology, statistics, and social theory.  Warrant is not defined as \u201cmakes trust rational\u201d tout court but as adherence to practices known to reduce specific error sources.  These practices have empirical and methodological justification distinct from the attitude of trust.\n\nObjection 2: Some objectivity senses seem to concern truth (mind-independence) more than warrant (justification).  How does the unifying story cope with realism?\n\nReply: Ontological objectivity of facts is indeed metaphysical, but scientists have access to it only via evidence.  Our functional account situates mind-independence as one more liability\u2014projection or relativity\u2014that specific invariance-seeking strategies mitigate.  The metaphysical dimension is acknowledged, yet the day-to-day indicator remains impersonal warrant.\n\nObjection 3: Science is value-laden; hence objectivity as impersonal warrant is illusory.\n\nReply: Values shape problem choice, data relevance, and sufficiency standards, as Douglas has shown.  But acknowledging that they can legitimately influence evidential thresholds does not collapse the distinction between partial and impartial warrant.  The interactive strategy explicitly integrates diverse value-orientations to counter unilateral influence; that is not an illusion but a social technology for managing values.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n6. Where does trust fit in after all?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTrust, then, is the attitude a non-expert (or expert in another field) ought to adopt when she has reason to believe impersonal warrant is in place.  For large-scale modern science, direct access to the warrant is rarely feasible; hence social proxies\u2014journal prestige, reproducibility records, institutional transparency\u2014stand in.  Fine and Douglas were right that objectivity is invoked to assure trust.  They were wrong only in equating the two notions.  Objectivity is the structured epistemic achievement that legitimates trust; trust is the social-psychological response.\n\nWe can state the relationship formally:\n\n   If output O of inquiry I possesses impersonal warrant W relative to question Q,  \n   then any agent A who recognises (or is entitled to believe) that W obtains is rationally permitted, ceteris paribus, to trust O in her deliberations about Q.\n\nThe ceteris paribus clause leaves room for defeaters\u2014conflicts of interest, political manipulation\u2014that void the entitlement.  Objectivity is thus neither infallible nor mystical; it is defeasible but genuine warrant.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n7. Conclusion\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe multiplicity of \u201cobjectivities\u201d is not a conceptual accident.  Different epistemic liabilities call for different counter-measures, so scientists have engineered a toolbox of warrant-strategies: protocols, machines, robustness tests, critical communities, and invariance searches.  What unites these is their common function: to make the reliability of scientific claims impersonal\u2014detached from any single person\u2019s honesty or perspicacity\u2014thereby permitting the rational extension of trust across vast epistemic distances.\n\nBy distinguishing warrant from trust, we sharpen Fine\u2019s and Douglas\u2019s insight instead of discarding it.  Objectivity is not merely the fact of being trusted; it is the property of being warrant-providing in a way that anyone, in principle, can ascertain.  Trust is the right downstream reaction to that property\u2014though people can fail or refuse to have it.\n\nIn compressed form:\n\n   Objectivity = the achievement of impersonal epistemic warrant.  \n   Trust = the justified willingness to act on claims possessing that warrant.\n\nWith this clarification, we can both celebrate the very real achievements of objective science and remain vigilant about the ever-present liabilities that undermine warrant.  The concept of objectivity regains precision, and its unifying heart turns out not to be trust itself but the public, checkable bases that make trust intellectually responsible.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 2, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 3097, "reasoning_tokens": 192}

What is the actual relationship between scientific objectivity and trust, and can we provide a more precise account of what unifies the different senses of objectivity?", "answer": "Objectivity and Trust in Science:\nTowards a More Precise Unifying Account \n(ca. 2 000 words)\n\n1. The intuitive link and the problem of precision  \nWhen citizens, policy\u2013makers, or fellow researchers call a scientific claim \u2018objective\u2019, they are typically expressing an attitude of epistemic confidence: they are prepared to rely on that claim in deliberation and action. Arthur Fine therefore glosses \u201cobjective\u201d as a \u201clabel of trust\u201d, and Heather Douglas similarly argues that the various senses of objectivity all \u201cdo the same rhetorical work\u2014they indicate that the result can be trusted.\u201d  The intuition is plausible, but as stated it is too thin to explain either (i) why the different senses of objectivity hang together or (ii) what distinguishes warranted trust from gullible deference.  What, precisely, is the relation between objectivity and trust, and what unifies procedural objectivity, convergent objectivity, and interactive objectivity?\n\nMy proposal is that the unifying core is not trust itself but the production of publicly assessable grounds that entitle a knower to place trust\u2014grounds that reduce the vulnerability inherent in relying on others by making scientific outputs accountable to impersonal standards.  On this view, objectivity is best understood as a family of \u201caccountability-securing practices.\u201d  Each sense of objectivity identifies a distinct strategy for blocking idiosyncratic error, bias, or deception, and thereby for underwriting rational trust.  Trust is the attitude that objectivity is meant to earn; objectivity is the cluster of practical and epistemic conditions that make the attitude reasonable.\n\n2. Three senses of objectivity revisited  \nTo see how the proposal works, recall the three senses that dominate recent discussions.\n\n2.1 Procedural objectivity (Daston & Galison).  \nA result is procedurally objective when it is generated by following a rule-governed procedure that minimises the role of individual judgement\u2014e.g., averaging multiple blinded measurements or using a standardized assay.  The guiding idea is mechanical discipline: anyone who follows the steps should obtain the same output, regardless of personal temperament or interests.\n\n2.2 Convergent or concordant objectivity.  \nA result is objectively warranted when multiple, epistemically independent methods or observers converge on it.  If X-ray diffraction, cryo-EM, and molecular dynamics all yield a 2.0 \u00c5 \u03b1-helix, we have robust reason to accept the structure.  Convergence is taken as a modal indicator of reliability: a belief resilient across independent lines of evidence is unlikely to be a coincidence of bias or error.\n\n2.3 Interactive (or critical) objectivity (Longino, Douglas).  \nA claim is objectively certified only after it has survived organised criticism, replication attempts, peer review, and broader community uptake.  Openness to challenges, transparency of data, and responsiveness to counter-evidence are the hallmarks.  Whereas procedural objectivity disciplines the individual producer, interactive objectivity disciplines the community through social norms of critique.\n\nThe trio does not exhaust the vocabulary of objectivity (measurement objectivity, causal objectivity, manipulability objectivity, etc.), but it captures the predominant ways in which practicing scientists defend their results.  What, then, unifies these ways beyond the vague gesture to \u201ctrust\u201d?\n\n3. Analysing trust  \nBefore answering, we need a sharper grip on trust itself.  Philosophers of trust (Baier, Hardin, Jones, O\u2019Neill) agree on two central features.\n\na) Three-place relation.  \u201cA trusts B to do \u03c6.\u201d  Trust is not a simple attitude toward a proposition; it is relational and task-specific.  I may trust the CDC to detect influenza outbreaks while distrusting it to model opioid addiction.\n\nb) Vulnerability plus normative expectation.  To trust is to make oneself vulnerable to another\u2019s agency while expecting that the other is competent and wills not to betray that vulnerability.  Mere reliance is insufficient; I rely on the alarm clock, but I do not (normally) trust it because it lacks intentions.  Trust carries a demand for accountability.\n\nApplied to science, the typical form is: \u201cLayperson L (or researcher R) trusts scientific community S to deliver claims p reliable enough for use u.\u201d  The price of misplaced trust is actionable harm; hence trust must be justified.\n\n4. From trust to warranted trust  \nJustified trust requires two components: (i) a good reason to believe that the trustee is competent and sincere; (ii) publicly available indicators that these conditions obtain.  The second requirement is crucial because science\u2019s audiences often lack direct access either to laboratories or to the technical know-how needed to evaluate data.  They must rely on indirect indicators\u2014certifications, reproducibility records, expert consensus, transparency measures, and the like.  I shall call these indirect indicators \u201cassurances.\u201d\n\nObjectivity, in all its senses, is a systematic technology for generating assurances.  A method is objective when it yields results whose reliability can be checked, replicated, or critiqued by parties other than the original researchers.  In short, objectivity is assurance-production, and assurances are what transform mere dependence into warranted trust.  This leads to a precise conceptual relation:\n\nObjectivity\u2003=\u2003epistemic and social practices designed to generate publicly assessable assurances of reliability;\nTrustworthiness\u2003=\u2003the property of deserving trust on the basis of those assurances;\nTrust\u2003=\u2003the doxastic\u2013practical attitude of those who recognise the assurances and therefore commit to rely.\n\n5. How each sense of objectivity earns trust  \nLet us examine how procedural, convergent, and interactive objectivity each contribute a distinct class of assurances.\n\n5.1 Procedural objectivity as ex ante discipline.  \nStandardised protocols, mechanical rules, blinding, and automation create assurances by (a) constraining the discretion of individuals and (b) recording each step so it can be audited.  The laboratory notebook, the instrument log, and the preregistration document are artefacts of assurance.  Because the procedure was such that any competent agent would have obtained the same numbers, users of the result can down-weight the risk that idiosyncrasies (wishful thinking, conflicts of interest, sloppy habits) contaminated the data.  The assurance here is uni-directional: if you trust the procedure, you can trust the outcome, even without knowing the scientist.\n\n5.2 Convergent objectivity as robustness signalling.  \nIndependently produced lines of evidence that meet in the same spot provide an assurance that at least some of them would have diverged had the conclusion been false.  This logic, famously articulated by Reichenbach as the \u201cprinciple of the common cause\u201d and refined in error-statistical accounts, is ex post rather than ex ante: after the fact, we ask whether the observed agreement is better explained by a real underlying phenomenon than by correlated error.  The assurance here comes from an independence condition; it is trustworthy because no single pathway\u2014no single potential source of bias\u2014can alone explain the convergence.\n\n5.3 Interactive objectivity as social accountability.  \nScience is necessarily a distributed cognitive enterprise.  Peer review, replication, post-publication critique, meta-analysis, and the churn of competitive funding schemes all force results to be exposed to potentially hostile scrutiny.  The assurance produced is diachronic and dialogical: the claim has survived known tests and remains open to further testing.  Importantly, interactive objectivity can repair shortcomings in the other two forms.  A hidden confounding factor may have eluded a standardised procedure; but if the data are public and the analysis code is shared, others can detect the flaw.  The continual possibility of correction is itself a ground for warranting trust.\n\nThus each sense of objectivity mitigates a specific vulnerability: procedural objectivity neutralises producer idiosyncrasy; convergent objectivity neutralises method-specific error; interactive objectivity neutralises community hubris or lock-in.  Together they install a multilayered defence of reliability.\n\n6. A unified account: \u201caccountability-securing practices\u201d  \nWhat unifies these practices conceptually is the norm of impersonal assessability.  A result is objective to the degree that:\n\n(i)   its generation follows standards that can be learned and applied by anyone with the requisite skills (transferability);  \n(ii)  its evidential support can be checked independently of its producer\u2019s identity or authority (contestability); and  \n(iii) failures, once detected, can feed back into revisions of the claim or the method (correctability).\n\nTransferability, contestability, and correctability jointly embody the idea of impersonal accountability.  Impersonal, because the warrant does not hinge on trusting a particular person\u2019s honesty or genius; accountable, because the practices supply standing reasons that can, in principle, be audited by any competent agent.  Trust is therefore not eliminated but relocated: rather than trusting individuals, we are licensed to trust that any residual error would, with high probability, be caught by the system of checks provided by objectivity-conferring practices.\n\n7. Advantages over the simple \u201ctrust\u201d gloss  \nThe refined account delivers several philosophical benefits.\n\na) It distinguishes trust (an attitude) from trustworthiness (a property) and explains how objectivity contributes to the latter but is not identical with the former.  Saying \u201cobjective = trustworthy\u201d conflates the basis of warrant with the attitude of reliance.\n\nb) It resolves the unification problem: the disparate senses of objectivity share the single function of generating impersonal assurances that transform brute dependence into rationally defensible trust.\n\nc) It captures why objectivity is a graded, not binary, predicate.  The more robust the mechanisms of transferability, contestability, and correctability that surround a claim, the more objective it is, and the greater the entitlement to trust.\n\nd) It makes room for the familiar feminist and STS critique that social values and power relations pervade science.  Values do influence which hypotheses are pursued, how evidential thresholds are set, and even which data are gathered.  Yet the accountability-securing model does not require value-free science; it requires only that the community\u2019s evaluative commitments be transparent and open to challenge.  Indeed, exposing values to criticism is part of interactive objectivity.\n\n8. Potential objections and replies  \nObjection 1: Isn\u2019t trust sometimes warranted in the absence of objectivity-conferring practices?  We might trust a lone expert whose track record is impeccable though his work is not easily reproducible.  \nReply: Track record itself is an assurance; repeated success under varied conditions functions much like convergence.  Moreover, the trust remains defeasible precisely because it lacks the richer suite of checks.  The vulnerability profile is higher, and rational agents will apportion their reliance accordingly.\n\nObjection 2: Objectivity cannot guarantee truth; so how can it secure warranted trust?  \nReply: Objectivity is reliability-enhancing, not infallible.  Trust is rational when the expected epistemic and practical payoff outweighs the risk, given the available assurances.  Accountability-securing practices raise the expected payoff by reducing systematic error, so they rationally license, though never compel, trust.\n\nObjection 3: If objectivity is defined in terms of practices valued because they yield trust, is the account viciously circular?  \nReply: The account is teleological, not circular.  We specify objectivity by its function (assurance-production) and then describe the concrete practices that perform this function.  We can evaluate whether a practice succeeds empirically\u2014e.g., by examining replication rates.  No analytic appeal to \u201ctrust\u201d is needed to identify the practice; \u201ctrust\u201d explains why the functional payoff matters.\n\n9. Implications for contemporary debates  \nThe clarification matters in at least three arenas.\n\ni) Science communication and public policy.  To restore public trust, we must display\u2014not merely proclaim\u2014the accountability-securing procedures.  Open data, preregistration, and citizen oversight are not PR moves; they enhance objective warrant by increasing contestability and correctability.\n\nii) Responsible research and innovation.  Value-laden decisions (e.g., choice of risk thresholds) become more objective\u2014not less\u2014when they are documented and subject to external review.  This counters the myth that \u201cvalue-free\u201d equals objective.\n\niii) Epistemic injustice.  When marginalised groups lack access to the forums where interactive objectivity operates, the community forfeits a source of critical scrutiny.  Expanding participatory mechanisms therefore increases objectivity by improving the breadth of contestability.\n\n10. Conclusion  \nFine and Douglas are right that invocations of objectivity serve the social function of signalling that a result can be trusted.  But \u201cobjectivity = trustworthiness\u201d is too coarse.  A more precise account runs as follows:\n\n1. Trust is a vulnerable epistemic attitude whose rationality depends on reliable assurances.  \n2. Objectivity is the family of epistemic and social practices\u2014procedural discipline, evidential convergence, organised criticism\u2014that create those assurances by making results impersonal, contestable, and correctable.  \n3. The various senses of objectivity are unified because they all perform this assurance-generating function, each addressing a different locus of potential failure.  \n\nObjectivity, therefore, is not a mystical quality infused into data; it is the tangible architecture of accountability that makes reliance on scientific results a rational bet.  Trust is the warranted, but always revisable, attitude made possible by that architecture.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 3, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 3453, "reasoning_tokens": 640}
{"question_id": "Koskinen-DefendingRiskAccount-2020", "question": "Several philosophers of science, including Arthur Fine and Heather Douglas, have suggested that the various applicable senses of scientific objectivity (such as procedural objectivity, convergent objectivity, and interactive objectivity) share a common basis in trust\u2014that when we call something objective, we indicate that it can be trusted. However, this characterization seems imprecise. What is the actual relationship between scientific objectivity and trust, and can we provide a more precise account of what unifies the different senses of objectivity?", "answer": "Scientific objectivity is one of the most frequently invoked but least analysed ideals in modern culture. We praise data, models, instruments, procedures, even entire persons or communities, for being \u201cobjective,\u201d and we contrast this with biased, partisan, or merely \u201csubjective\u201d opinion. Yet the recently popular slogan\u2014originating in different ways in the work of Arthur Fine, Heather Douglas, and a number of social epistemologists\u2014that \u201cobjectivity just means trustworthiness\u201d sounds, on its face, both too vague and too cheap. Surely scientists also want their results to be true, explanatory, reliable, and so on; and surely we can sometimes trust things that are not objective (my dog to greet me at the door) or mistrust things that are (a correct but politically inconvenient climate model). In what follows I will argue that the slogan contains an important insight, though badly in need of sharpening. \u201cObjectivity\u201d in all its salient scientific senses does, indeed, concern the social distribution of epistemic trust. However, the relationship is indirect and mediated by a more basic underlying feature\u2014resilience under perspective change. On my proposal, what unifies procedural objectivity, convergent objectivity, and interactive objectivity is that each enforces a set of \u201cchecks of perspective.\u201d The more a claim, datum or method remains stable when subjected to relevant perspective shifts\u2014different observers, different instruments, different theoretical commitments, different social interests\u2014the more it justifies the community\u2019s trust. Trust, then, is not what objectivity is, but what objectivity earns.\n\n1. The Plethora of \u201cObjectivities\u201d  \n\nSince the late 1980s the literature has proliferated with finer-grained categories: Thomas Nagel\u2019s view-from-nowhere objectivity, Lorison and Galison\u2019s mechanical versus disciplinary objectivity, Helen Longino\u2019s critical interactive objectivity, and so on. What has driven the taxonomy is an appreciation that different scientific tasks face different hazards of bias and therefore require different safeguards.\n\na. Procedural objectivity (sometimes \u201cmechanical objectivity\u201d) demands strict adherence to pre-specified rules that minimize the discretionary judgment of individual investigators. Think of the nineteenth-century injunction \u201cdraw what you see\u201d in anatomy or the modern use of fully automated data pipelines in genomics.\n\nb. Convergent objectivity is the epistemic bonus that accrues when multiple, independent pathways of inquiry yield the same or mutually supporting results: tree-ring data, ice-core bubbles, and satellite measurements all converge on the same hockey-stick diagram of global temperature.\n\nc. Interactive objectivity, defended by Longino and Douglas, shifts attention from procedures and results to the social practices of critical dialogue\u2014peer review, replication attempts, adversarial collaboration\u2014by which an inquiring community filters out the idiosyncrasies of its members.\n\nThe problem is obvious. These senses work differently, apply at different stages of research, and, in some cases, can trade off against each other. An automated data pipeline may satisfy procedural objectivity yet obscure the very anomalies that interactive scrutiny would have caught. If objectivity is a single concept, what keeps the list from fragmenting?\n\n2. Fine, Douglas, and the Trust Proposal  \n\nArthur Fine famously argued for the \u201cNatural Ontological Attitude\u201d (NOA), urging philosophers to \u201cjust take the results of successful science on trust.\u201d Heather Douglas\u2019s more policy-oriented Ethics of Science advises that objective science is the sort citizens properly trust when making decisions under conditions of uncertainty. Neither author claims trust exhausts the meaning of objectivity; nevertheless, many readers have treated \u201cobjective = trustworthy\u201d as a slogan with unifying ambitions.\n\nWhat makes the suggestion attractive is that trust is both relational and normative. Trust is extended by someone (the trustor) to someone or something (the trustee) concerning some matter (the domain). It involves vulnerability: if the trusted object misleads, the truster can be harmed. Likewise, objectivity is invoked to reassure vulnerable audiences\u2014scientists, policy makers, the public\u2014that they may rely on results without personally scrutinising every step.\n\nBut as philosophers of trust such as Karen Jones and Annette Baier emphasise, trust differs from mere reliance by adding an expectation of good will or proper motivation. One can rely on a rattlesnake to bite, but one does not thereby trust it. Scientific objectivity, by contrast, need not involve any moral component; we can speak of an objective, well-calibrated instrument with no hint of benevolence. So the trust/objectivity connection must run through a more abstract notion of trustworthiness: a disposition to perform in accordance with its advertised epistemic function\u2014representing the world accurately\u2014under a reasonable range of circumstances.\n\n3. Perspective Change as the Root Idea  \n\nConsider what each type of objectivity actually accomplishes. Procedural objectivity strips away dependence on the idiosyncratic perceptual or cognitive traits of a particular observer. Convergent objectivity makes sure the result does not hinge on the quirks of one experimental setup. Interactive objectivity obliges claims to survive exposure to diverse standpoints, disciplinary commitments, and background values. In all three cases a result is declared \u201cobjective\u201d precisely when it has demonstrated invariance under a family of perspective shifts. The underlying pattern recalls an old epistemic ideal: that knowledge should be independent of epistemically irrelevant contingencies.\n\nThis robustness-under-transformation criterion is already familiar in philosophy of science. Wimsatt discusses robustness analysis; Cartwright speaks of nomological invariance; Galison interprets \u201cobjectivity\u201d historically as an attempt to purge \u201cnaughty\u201d subjectivities by multiplying mutually calibrated windows on the world. My suggestion is to unify these ideas under the rubric \u201cchecks of perspective.\u201d Each sense of objectivity operationalizes the same deeper strategy: design your methods so that if a claim would have failed under some legitimate shift of standpoint, it probably will fail (and therefore be caught) in the actual run of inquiry.\n\n4. From Perspective Checks to Earned Trust  \n\nWhy does invariance under perspective change earn trust? Because, given the social division of cognitive labor, no single agent can collect all evidence or perform all tests. We must therefore delegate epistemic authority to procedures, instruments, and communities whose outputs we accept at less-than-first-hand. We are vulnerable to their possible malfunction or malfeasance. Robustness gives us a principled reason to believe that such vulnerabilities are acceptably low. If a claim has been exposed to, and survived, a battery of relevant perspective checks, then the probability that it owes its success to hidden bias, wishful thinking, or error is reduced. We therefore have pro tanto justification to treat it as trustworthy in the epistemically diluted sense appropriate to large-scale cooperative knowledge.\n\nNotice the asymmetry: objectivity is a property of the epistemic product or the practice that generated it; trust is an attitude of epistemic agents. Objectivity does not equal trust; rather, objectivity warrants trust. This allows us to explain obvious counter-examples. A person may irrationally withhold trust from an objective study because of motivated reasoning. Conversely, a charismatic fraud might undeservedly attract trust. The two notions float free, but they are normatively connected: when we call something \u201cobjective\u201d we implicitly recommend it as a proper target of trust because of its demonstrated resilience to perspective shifts.\n\n5. Precision via a Two-Factor Account: Reliability and Accountability  \n\nTo sharpen the connection further, let us draw on recent work in social epistemology that analyses trustworthiness in two dimensions:\n\nReliability factor: the likelihood that the source delivers true or accurate content.\n\nAccountability factor: the extent to which the source is answerable if things go wrong and hence has incentives aligned with epistemic accuracy.\n\nBoth factors presuppose perspective checks. Robustness contributes to reliability by making truth more stable under perturbation. It contributes to accountability by institutionalising opportunities for challenge\u2014each new perspective is a potential whistle-blower.\n\nWe can now specify how each sense of objectivity targets one or both factors.\n\nProcedural objectivity maximises accountability by making steps transparent and replicable; anyone can audit the pipeline.\n\nConvergent objectivity attacks reliability head-on: independent lines of evidence raise the probability that the result tracks a real-world invariant.\n\nInteractive objectivity secures both factors simultaneously: the critical community is a standing mechanism for error detection (reliability) and for calling investigators to account (accountability).\n\nBecause each form instantiates the same two-factor model, we can explain their family resemblance without collapsing them into synonyms.\n\n6. Advantages over Competing Unifiers  \n\nSuppose one tried instead to unify objectivity via \u201cvalue-freeness.\u201d The project fails, as critics from Weber onward have shown, because values infiltrate everything from project choice to experiment design. Or one might say objectivity is \u201cabsence of bias,\u201d but bias itself can only be defined relative to some baseline of legitimate perspectival influence\u2014leading us back to the architecture of perspective checks. The present account also accommodates feminist and standpoint-theoretic critiques. Marginalised standpoints are epistemically valuable precisely because they supply additional, often neglected, perspective shifts that improve robustness. Thus the call for diversity in science is not a mere social justice add-on; it is an engine of objectivity in the sense defined.\n\n7. Replies to Objections  \n\nObjection 1: Some perfectly objective truths are not yet cross-checked by multiple perspectives\u2014think of a lone astronomer who correctly infers a new exoplanet from unprecedented measurements.  \n\nReply: Objectivity is not an all-or-nothing label attached only post facto. The lone astronomer\u2019s methods may still instantiate robustness features internally (e.g., multiple independent indicators within her data set). What we lack is community confirmation; hence our confidence\u2014our readiness to trust\u2014should be provisional. The account allows gradations.\n\nObjection 2: Trust also requires moral or political assessment. Suppose a result is robust but will be used by an unaccountable corporation. Don\u2019t we then withhold trust?  \n\nReply: We must distinguish epistemic trust in the result itself from practical reliance on the agents wielding it. One can accept that a pesticide toxicity study is objectively sound while distrusting the company\u2019s deployment of that result. Our analysis concerns epistemic, not practical, trust; it dovetails but does not settle the further ethical question.\n\nObjection 3: The perspective-invariance criterion is itself perspectival\u2014it valorises certain shifts (instrumental, inter-subjective) but not others (religious revelation).  \n\nReply: True, the catalogue of \u201crelevant\u201d perspective shifts is rule-governed and historically contingent. Yet this is no scandal; it underscores the interactive dimension. The scientific community continually debates which challenges are legitimate. The standard is reflexively revisable, which is why objectivity is a regulative ideal rather than a metaphysical property.\n\n8. Empirical Illustration: Climate Attribution Studies  \n\nConsider the detection-attribution protocols used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Raw surface-temperature data undergo homogenisation (procedural objectivity). Multiple modelling groups, using distinct ocean-atmosphere codes, estimate radiative forcings (convergent objectivity). Draft chapters are circulated for open review by experts with diverse theoretical commitments, including industry-funded sceptics (interactive objectivity). Each stage increases resistance to the idiosyncrasies of any single model, dataset, or political agenda. The end product garners a \u201cvery high confidence\u201d label, which the IPCC defines in probabilistic terms. Lay citizens are then invited to trust these conclusions for policy purposes. The invitation is not a leap of faith; it is the rational endpoint of a cascade of perspective checks.\n\n9. Relationship to Truth and Realism  \n\nDoes my unifying account reduce objectivity to social procedures, thereby flirting with relativism? No. Perspective checks are valuable only because the world itself possesses stable structure. If there were no mind-independent regularities, convergence across independent avenues would be a cosmological miracle. Thus objectivity, on my view, is Janus-faced: it is socially constructed in its mechanisms yet realist in its explanatory presupposition. The checks of perspective work only because there is, as Putnam puts it, \u201ca ready-made world\u201d capable of making the robust survivors true. Trust, therefore, travels both outward, toward persons and institutions, and inward, toward the world\u2019s own cooperation.\n\n10. Conclusion  \n\nThe alleged vagueness of \u201cobjective = trustworthy\u201d dissolves once we distinguish attitude from warrant and identify the mechanism by which warrant is earned. Scientific objectivity, in its procedural, convergent, and interactive guises, is unified by the same logical architecture: the systematic exposure of epistemic products to a network of relevance-appropriate perspective shifts. Robustness under those shifts grounds a defeasible but powerful entitlement to epistemic trust. In short,\n\nObjectivity = perspective-check robustness  \nTrustworthiness = the entitlement thereby generated.\n\nThis two-step analysis rescues the insights of Fine and Douglas without sacrificing precision, sidesteps false dichotomies between procedure and community, and provides a flexible framework for both defending and reforming scientific practice. The better our methods at enforcing perspective checks, the more rational it is\u2014for scientists, policymakers, and publics alike\u2014to trust the science we produce.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 4, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 3287, "reasoning_tokens": 512}

However, this characterization seems imprecise. What is the actual relationship between scientific objectivity and trust, and can we provide a more precise account of what unifies the different senses of objectivity?", "answer": "Objectivity and Trust in Science: Toward a Precise Unifying Account\n\n1. Introduction\n\n\u201cObjective\u201d is both one of the most honorific and one of the least transparent terms in philosophy of science. We confer it on laboratory techniques, statistical procedures, theoretical claims, computer models, and even entire institutions, yet with different meanings in each context. Facing this pluralism, several influential authors\u2014most notably Arthur Fine and Heather Douglas\u2014have proposed that the disparate senses of scientific objectivity are unified by a common pragmatic function: they mark persons, results, or methods as trustworthy. Calling something objective signals that it can be relied on. As Douglas puts it, \u201cObjectivity is best understood as the grounds for trust.\u201d  \n\nThis diagnosis is attractive. It explains why scientists and citizens care about objectivity and why accusations of bias or subjectivity feel like moral as well as epistemic critiques; they threaten the very possibility of taking the relevant claims on trust. Yet the proposal also seems too thin. Trust is a relation between persons: A trusts B to do X. Objectivity, by contrast, is usually described as a property of the epistemic products or processes themselves: the measurement is objective, the data-analysis protocol is objective, the consensus statement is objective. How exactly does the interpersonal attitude of trust arise from, or map onto, these seemingly impersonal properties? And can the trust\u2013objectivity link explain what the various species of objectivity\u2014procedural, mechanical, convergent, interactive, etc.\u2014have in common? In what follows I argue that we can give a more precise answer.  \n\n(1) The common core of the different senses of scientific objectivity is not trust simpliciter but the capacity of certain epistemic products or practices to attract what I shall call freely transferable trust\u2014that is, warranted reliance by agents who need not have participated in, or even observed, the original process.  \n\n(2) Practices and products qualify for such transferable trust to the extent that they meet two jointly necessary conditions: independence of idiosyncratic factors and public checkability. These conditions explain the characteristic features of the standard forms of objectivity and why satisfying them invites trust.  \n\nI begin by briefly reviewing the main varieties of objectivity invoked in contemporary philosophy of science. I then analyze the concept of trust and distinguish the generic stance of reliance from the more demanding notion of transferable trust that is essential when knowledge is socially distributed. I proceed to articulate the two conditions\u2014independence and checkability\u2014and show how each canonical sense of objectivity can be understood as a different technology for meeting them. Finally, I respond to two potential objections: (a) that my account collapses into a merely sociological explanation of objectivity, and (b) that it leaves out the metaphysical dimension often emphasized in realism debates. I conclude that although objectivity involves more than trust, the unity of its varieties lies precisely in their capacity to manufacture a distinctive, impersonal kind of trust that is indispensable in a modern, large-scale, highly specialized scientific enterprise.\n\n2. A Taxonomy of Objectivity\n\nOver the last forty years philosophers have charted at least six mutually overlapping senses of objectivity in science. A compressed overview will suffice.\n\na. Procedural (or mechanical) objectivity. Championed by Daston and Galison\u2019s historical work, this sense refers to strict, rule-governed methods that minimize the role of personal judgment: double-blinded trials, automatic recording instruments, pre-registered statistical analyses.\n\nb. Detached (or ontological) objectivity. This sense, common in realism debates, locates objectivity in the relationship between representations and mind-independent reality; the claims are true independently of observers\u2019 perspectives.\n\nc. Convergent (or consensus) objectivity. Here objectivity is identified with stable inter-subjective agreement of competent investigators under ideal epistemic conditions; the classic reference is Peirce\u2019s convergence of inquiry.\n\nd. Interactive or critical objectivity. Helen Longino and Douglas emphasize norms of communal criticism\u2014diverse perspectives, uptake of objections, and responsive revision\u2014as constitutive of objectivity.\n\ne. Measurement objectivity. Associated with metrology: a measurement is objective when it is invariant under a set of admissible transformations of apparatus or context.\n\nf. Evidential objectivity. In statistics, an inference is objective when evidential import is determined by data alone (as with likelihood methods) and not by prior judgments.\n\nAt first glance these forms seem to involve different properties: rigidity of procedure, correspondence to reality, social consensus, robustness under transformation, and so on. Nevertheless scientists apply the single term \u201cobjective\u201d to all of them. Fine and Douglas therefore suggest that saying \u201cobjective\u201d functions pragmatically as a marker of trust: if a process or result is objective in any of these senses, an audience is entitled to rely on it. My aim is to sharpen this linking idea.\n\n3. What Sort of Trust Is at Issue?\n\nTrust is often defined as a three-place relation: A trusts B to do \u03c6. It combines a cognitive component (the belief or assumption that B is competent and well-motivated) with a normative component (A makes herself vulnerable to B\u2019s performance). Philosophers distinguish trust from mere reliance: one can rely on the sun to rise without trusting it, because the sun is not an agent whose reasons and goodwill are pertinent.\n\nScientific objectivity, however, must license reliance by a far-flung network of agents, most of whom will never meet the originators of the knowledge. Consider a virologist in Brazil who builds her experiment on a gene expression database compiled in Sweden, or policy makers drafting pandemic guidelines using a meta-analysis produced by researchers they will never meet. The relevant epistemic attitude is thus not face-to-face interpersonal trust but transferable trust: a downstream agent can rationally treat the upstream deliverables as if they were produced by responsible colleagues even when she cannot inspect each step or vouch for each individual\u2019s integrity. The question of objectivity, then, is: Under what conditions do scientific products merit transferable trust in this sense? A promising answer is that they do so when the processes that yielded them are conceived so as to avoid dependence on the particulars of their producers (independence) while at the same time allowing later scrutiny (checkability). Let me explain.\n\n4. Independence of Idiosyncrasy\n\nA process is independent of idiosyncrasy when its outcome does not hinge on any factor unique to a particular person, apparatus, or local context. If the identity, interests, or transient moods of the researcher make a difference, then a distant consumer who knows nothing about those particularities cannot rationally transfer trust. Independence is thus a form of robustness: replacing the original inquirers with equally competent ones, or repeating the measurement with calibrated successor instruments, would yield the same result to within a tolerable margin. Put differently, the epistemic credit is shifted from individual virtue to method or system. Procedural objectivity achieves independence by prescribing standardized protocols, convergent objectivity by averaging across multiple inquirers, measurement objectivity by stabilizing under transformation groups, and critical objectivity by ensuring that individual biases are cancelled through social interaction.\n\n5. Public Checkability\n\nIndependence alone is not enough. Even an entirely automated data-pipeline, if kept secret, would not engender transferable trust; downstream users have no way to verify either compliance with the protocol or the absence of hidden failure modes. Hence the complementary requirement: the relevant aspects of the procedure and its outputs must be open to public inspection, replication, or at least audit. Checkability can vary in depth\u2014from raw-data release and open-source code to traceable calibration chains in metrology or explicit argumentative chains in theoretical reasoning\u2014but some route of scrutiny must remain available in principle.\n\nThe dual conditions mirror the logic of modern institutions. Courts, for instance, aim to deliver judgments that can be taken as authoritative by people who never attend the trial. They do so by adhering to impersonal rules of evidence (independence) and by maintaining publicly accessible transcripts and justifications (checkability). Scientific objectivity can be understood on an analogous model.\n\n6. Mapping the Conditions onto the Varieties\n\nWe can now see how the standard kinds of objectivity operationalize independence and checkability.\n\na. Procedural Objectivity. Laboratory manuals, double-blind randomization, and mechanical registration eliminate the discretionary checkpoints where idiosyncrasy might intrude. Standard operating procedures are published, peer-reviewed, or certified, thereby satisfying checkability. The result is objective in virtue of being method-bound and inspectable.\n\nb. Measurement Objectivity. The invariance of a quantified property when measured with different instruments or under different local conditions demonstrates independence from a particular setup. Metrological institutions such as the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures maintain publicly available calibration hierarchies, providing checkability.\n\nc. Convergent Objectivity. Agreement obtained independently by a plurality of research groups is a statistical guarantee that individual quirks wash out. Publication of methodologies and data enables the public to judge whether the convergence is genuine or artifactual.\n\nd. Interactive/Critical Objectivity. Longino\u2019s norms of openness to criticism, uptake of dissent, and publicly recognized standards are explicitly geared toward neutralizing individual epistemic or social biases (independence) through a structured critical dialogue that is publicly accessible (checkability).\n\ne. Evidential Objectivity. Removing subjective priors from statistical inference tries to ensure that evidential import is determined only by data (independence). The explicit algorithmic form of likelihood or frequentist methods satisfies checkability.\n\nf. Detached Objectivity. Reference to a mind-independent world may seem to fall outside the social mechanisms I have stressed, but in practice the endorsement of an ontologically objective claim requires demonstrating that the posited entity behaves the same no matter who observes it (independence) and that there are replicable experimental or observational procedures to reveal that behavior (checkability). Thus even ontological objectivity involves meeting our two conditions in empirical practice.\n\nHence the common denominator across senses of objectivity is not any single technique but the functional achievement of these twin conditions. Each variety supplies a different technology for doing so, adapted to different kinds of epistemic tasks.\n\n7. Why Meeting the Conditions Warrants Transferable Trust\n\nSuppose an epistemic product has satisfied independence and checkability. A downstream agent can then reason as follows:\n\n(i) Because the outcome does not depend on unique personal factors of the producers, I need not know their psychologies or local circumstances; any competent agent would have arrived at the same result under the protocol.\n\n(ii) Because the protocol and evidential chain are open to audit, if I, or others, do suspect error or bias, there exists a principled route to detect it.\n\nHence reliance is rational even absent interpersonal familiarity. In effect, the two conditions transform a potentially fragile, reputation-based trust into a system-based or impersonal trust\u2014trust in the process rather than in the person. Luhmann\u2019s sociological analysis of trust as a mechanism for reducing social complexity applies here: scientists could not cooperate globally without such system-level guarantees.\n\n8. Objection 1: Does This Reduce Objectivity to Sociology?\n\nOne might worry that by emphasizing social independence and checkability I make objectivity a purely sociological phenomenon, ignoring the truth-tracking function that realists prize. There are two replies. First, the dual-condition account is not merely sociological; independence and checkability are epistemic virtues precisely because they increase the likelihood that error is avoided and that truth is captured. Second, in practice even metaphysical objectivity is inseparable from method; the only way we know a claim is mind-independent is by experimentally revealing its invariances across perspectives, which are socialized through peer criticism and replication. Hence the sociological mechanisms are not a rival to truth but its indispensable conduit.\n\n9. Objection 2: Are Independence and Checkability Really Necessary?\n\nCould there be a future epistemic procedure\u2014say, a super-intelligent AI oracle\u2014that delivers stunningly accurate predictions yet reveals neither its inner workings nor any grounds for expecting invariance across contexts? Would we deny objectivity to such an oracle? I think so, and our intuitions already tell us why. Without independent replicability or transparency, we have no basis for transferable trust. Even if the oracle happens to be right, the status of its deliverances resembles testimony from an unvetted witness. The scientific concept of objectivity is designed for communal knowledge, not private revelation. Hence the oracle\u2019s outputs would be at best \u201cauthoritative,\u201d not \u201cobjective.\u201d\n\n10. Implications for Policy and Science Communication\n\nSeeing objectivity as the engineering of transferable trust clarifies several practical debates.\n\n\u2022 Openness and reproducibility: Calls for open data and code are not fetishistic but target the checkability condition; without them confidence degrades into personal authority.\n\n\u2022 Diversity in peer review: Bringing multiple perspectives to bear satisfies the independence condition by canceling correlated biases.\n\n\u2022 Science advising: When policy makers demand \u201cobjective evidence,\u201d they are effectively demanding assurances that the science consulted meets these two conditions, not that it is value-free.\n\n\u2022 Public controversy: Citizens who distrust climate science often allege corruption or conspiratorial collusion, precisely challenging the independence and checkability conditions. Strengthening institutional transparency and encouraging independent replication are therefore more fruitful than mere reiteration of expert authority.\n\n11. Conclusion\n\nThe association between scientific objectivity and trust identified by Fine and Douglas is indeed profound, but to be philosophically illuminating it must be specified. The variety of objectivity forms a family held together by a functional aim: enabling scientific products to merit transferable trust. They do so when, and only when, the processes that generate them are (i) independent of idiosyncratic factors of producers and (ii) publicly checkable. Each canonical sense of objectivity is a concrete strategy for realizing these conditions under varying epistemic constraints. Objectivity, on this account, is neither an ineffable metaphysical honorific nor a mere sociological convention. It is a normative achievement: the construction of impersonal epistemic warrants that make widespread reliance rational. By engineering independence and checkability, the sciences transform the fragile interpersonal trust of localized communities into the robust, system-level trust on which modern knowledge and policy depend.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 5, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 3258, "reasoning_tokens": 320}

What we most want from objectivity\u2014whether in a climate\u2010change model, a medical trial, or a forensic lab\u2014is the entitlement to rely on the deliverances of science without having to replicate every experiment ourselves.  Yet \u201cobjectivity = trust\u201d is too quick.  Trust is a psychological attitude, located in agents; objectivity is a normative property, located in epistemic products and practices.  To say that a result is objective is not merely to report that someone happens to trust it, nor even that most reasonable people do.  It is to claim that the result has qualities that entitle such trust.  The concept of trust, then, must be unpacked in a way that allows it to illuminate, rather than simply re\u2010label, the unity of the diverse species of objectivity philosophers have catalogued\u2014procedural, convergent, interactive, and so on.\n\nI will argue that the relationship between objectivity and trust is best described as follows:  objectivity is the suite of epistemic safeguards that make a claim apt to be *rightly* trusted by a plurality of agents who do not necessarily share social location, motivations, or background assumptions.  Different senses of objectivity highlight different safeguards, but they are unified by three common elements:\n\n1. Depersonalizing Independence:  mechanisms that remove idiosyncratic, interest\u2010driven, or perspectival distortions from the evidential connection between world and claim.\n\n2. Public Accessibility:  the production of records, materials, or arguments that can in principle be scrutinized by others independently of the original producers.\n\n3. Error\u2010Correcting Feedback:  social or empirical procedures by which challenges can be mounted and mistakes detected and repaired.\n\nTogether these elements create *warranted epistemic reliance*\u2014a property of claims and processes.  Trust, in the interpersonal sense, is the attitude we are entitled to adopt *in virtue of* the possession of warranted epistemic reliance.  That is why talk of objectivity slides so easily into talk of trust without collapsing into it.\n\nI.  The Landscape of Objectivity\n\nPhilosophers of science insist that there is no single monolithic sense of \u201cobjectivity.\u201d  Three families are prominent.\n\n1. Procedural objectivity (Hacking 1983; Portability, Reproducibility).  Objectivity is secured by following standardized, explicit, mechanical methods that remove individual judgment.  Think of nineteenth\u2010century \u201ctrained judgement\u201d in astronomy or double\u2010blind randomized clinical trials today.\n\n2. Convergent or ontic objectivity (Kitcher 1993; Chang 2004).  Objectivity consists in stable agreement among independent inquirers or instruments.  Replication, consilience, measurement concordance, and predictive success make a claim resilient across contexts.\n\n3. Interactive or social objectivity (Longino 1990; Fine 1998; Douglas 2009).  Here objectivity arises from critical dialogue among differently situated knowers, inclusion of diverse perspectives, and institutionalized critique that exposes background assumptions.\n\nAll three conceptions mark ways of fending off bias, idiosyncrasy, and error.  But they do so by distinct techniques: imposing rules, accumulating converging evidence, or cultivating socially distributed criticism.  What unifies them seems elusive.\n\nII.  Trust:  Reliance Plus Normative Expectation\n\nTo probe the unity, we must know what \u201ctrust\u201d involves.  Standard analyses distinguish mere reliance (I rely on my alarm clock, but do not trust it) from trust proper (I trust my colleague to finish the joint paper).  According to Annette Baier, to trust someone is to accept vulnerability to their goodwill; for Russell Hardin it is to believe that they have \u201cencapsulated\u201d one\u2019s interests; for Karen Jones it centrally involves a normative expectation that the trusted party will be *competent and committed* to the entrusted task, and that they are *responsible* for failure.\n\nThree features are common across these accounts:\n\na.  Epistemic Opacity: the truster cannot monitor every step of the trustee\u2019s action.\n\nb.  Delegated Responsibility: the trustee is counted on to perform well for the truster\u2019s sake.\n\nc.  Accountability: the trustee is answerable if things go wrong.\n\nScientific practice is a paradigm case of distributed, opaque, delegated epistemic labor: very few of us can re\u2010derive the standard model of particle physics, culture a vaccine, or launch a satellite.  Laypersons and even specialist peers must trust.  But trust is rational only if science is trustworthy, i.e. if there are reliable safeguards ensuring competence, commitment, and accountability.  Objectivity just *is* that safeguard infrastructure.\n\nIII.  Diagnosing the Fine/Douglas Imprecision\n\nWhen Fine says \u201cobjective = trustworthy,\u201d one might hear either a semantic claim (the words are synonymous) or an epistemic\u2010pragmatic claim (objectivity is whatever warrants trust).  The semantic reading fails:  I can say \u201cthe measurement is objective, but I still don\u2019t trust it\u201d (perhaps because I worry about undetected systematic errors).  Conversely, I can trust a friend\u2019s hunch without thinking it objective.  The terms are not interchangeable.\n\nThe epistemic\u2010pragmatic reading is more promising, but it still needs flesh.  What are the specific properties that justify trust?  Fine tends merely to gesture at \u201cfairness\u201d and \u201cmethod,\u201d Douglas at \u201crecognizing and managing values.\u201d  Without a more articulated account, appeals to trust threaten to collapse into a vague slogan.\n\nIV.  Objectivity as Warranted Epistemic Reliance\n\nThe needed articulation can be provided by seeing objectivity as a *functional profile*:  an arrangement of practices that secure the three elements announced earlier\u2014depersonalizing independence, public accessibility, and error\u2010correction.\n\n1. Depersonalizing Independence\n\nIndependence does not require mythical \u201cview\u2010from\u2010nowhere\u201d neutrality; it requires stripping away those factors that systematically distort the evidential link.  Double\u2010blind trials block placebo effects and clinician enthusiasm.  Calibrated instruments standardize perception.  Diverse critical communities neutralize the blind spots of homogenous groups.  What is common is a device for *making the evidential connection not hostage to any one person\u2019s stakes or standpoint*.\n\n2. Public Accessibility\n\nResults, methods, and data must be recorded in a form inspectable by others.  Journals, preprint servers, laboratory notebooks, specimen archives, and open\u2010source software code operate as public memory.  Accessibility allows potential critics to re\u2010run analyses or to look for unnoticed alternatives.  Objectivity thus embeds transparency.\n\n3. Error\u2010Correcting Feedback\n\nEven the best procedures and most transparent records would still harbor latent errors unless the community could *act* on potential defects.  Peer review, attempted replication, post\u2010publication commentary, formal retraction policies, meta\u2010analyses, and funding diversity provide channels for challenge and revision.  The point is not to guarantee infallibility but to make fallibility visible and tractable.\n\nWhen these three functions are in place, a result becomes apt for uptake by agents who, while lacking direct epistemic access, can rationally infer that the system of production is *reliable enough*.  They can therefore extend their belief system or practical reasoning on its basis\u2014precisely what we mean by warranted trust.\n\nV.  Showing the Unity\n\nLet us see how each species of objectivity fits the template.\n\na. Procedural Objectivity\n\nStandardized protocols create depersonalizing independence:  the outcome does not depend on the idiosyncratic skill of a particular microscopist.  Manuals, SOPs, Good Laboratory Practice assure public accessibility; anyone can, in principle, inspect the protocol.  Replication requirements offer error\u2010correcting feedback.  Hence the procedural sense satisfies all three elements, and we understand why following the procedure is taken to make a result \u201cobjective.\u201d\n\nb. Convergent Objectivity\n\nMultiple independent lines of evidence instantiate depersonalizing independence at a higher level:  whatever the individual slants of each experiment, the net overlap weeds them out.  Publishing separate confirmations supplies accessibility, while the possibility of discordant data forces error correction.  The long\u2010run convergence of measurement of the electron charge, for example, is what grounds our trust in that value.\n\nc. Interactive Objectivity\n\nLongino\u2019s \u201ctransformative criticism\u201d embeds independence in the diversity of standpoints (gender, disciplinary background, methodological commitments).  Open debate and data sharing ensure accessibility; institutionalized criticism (conferences, journals, ombudspersons) delivers error correction.  Thus, interactive objectivity too enacts the tripartite structure.\n\nWhat looked like a motley of senses is instead a family of techniques for installing the same functional profile.  The particular tools differ, but the architectural goal\u2014warranted reliance for plural audiences\u2014remains constant.\n\nVI.  Formalizing the Account\n\nFor precision we may cast the idea in a simplified formal schema.\n\nLet C be a community of agents {a\u2081 \u2026 a\u2099}.  Let S be an epistemic procedure (experiment, model, argument) yielding claim p about target domain D.  Say p is objective relative to C and S just in case:\n\nO1.  For each i, there exists a feasible path \u03c0\u1d62 consisting of publicly specified steps in S such that, were i to follow \u03c0\u1d62 conscientiously, i would with high probability arrive at p (independence + accessibility).\n\nO2.  For any subset C\u2032 \u2282 C undertaking S, the probability that at least one member detects any significant error in p exceeds threshold \u03b5 (error\u2010correction).\n\nO3.  The above expectations are common knowledge in C.\n\nGiven O1\u2013O3, rational agents in C are licensed to assign high credence to p even without personally executing S, i.e. they can trust p.  Objectivity is not identical with trust (it is a property defined by O1\u2013O3), but it grounds the rationality of trust.\n\nVII.  Advantages Over Competing Accounts\n\n1. Distinguishing Trust from Trustworthiness\n\nBy locating trust in the agents and objectivity in the claims/practices, we escape the semantic blur.  One can mis\u2010trust an objective claim (climate skepticism) or trust a non\u2010objective one (astrology).  The analysis predicts these possibilities.\n\n2. Integrating Feminist and STS Critiques\n\nCritics like Harding and Longino stress situated knowledge and power dynamics; our framework incorporates them through element (1) and (3).  If gender or colonial power systematically excludes voices, independence and error correction degrade, and objectivity is undermined.  Thus the account explains why inclusion is not political window\u2010dressing but epistemically mandatory.\n\n3. Explaining Degrees of Objectivity\n\nBecause the elements admit gradations\u2014procedures can be more or less standardized, archives more or less open, criticism more or less free\u2014objectivity comes in degrees.  That matches scientific practice, where results are provisional, and \u201crobust\u201d findings earn more deference than preliminary ones.\n\n4. Handling Value\u2010Ladenness\n\nDouglas emphasizes that values inevitably enter scientific inference.  Our view accommodates this:  values are not banned; they are rendered visible and contestable by public accessibility and error\u2010correcting discussion.  Thus, objectivity is not sterile value\u2010exclusion but regulated value\u2010management.\n\nVIII.  Objections and Replies\n\nObjection 1:  What about lone\u2010genius discoveries?  Mendel\u2019s pea counts were not socially vetted until decades later; yet we now regard them as objective.\n\nReply:  The property of objectivity is temporally indexed to the availability of the safeguards.  Mendel\u2019s results became objective once the community reconstructed, replicated, and scrutinized them.  Prior to that, they were promising but not yet entitled to communal trust.\n\nObjection 2:  Circularity:  Public scrutiny itself presupposes trust in the scrutinizers.\n\nReply:  The account is not viciously circular because it is bootstrapped by distributed redundancy.  No single agent or sub\u2010group must be antecedently trusted; rather, the plurality of perspectives and the possibility of mutual checking reduce the dependency on any particular strand of trust.\n\nObjection 3:  Could objectivity be secured in a closed, secretive intelligence lab if their internal procedures satisfied the criteria?\n\nReply:  It could be *internal* objectivity relative to that community but would fail O1\u2013O3 with respect to the broader public.  The account is relativized to the trusting audience.  What counts as objective for insiders may not for outsiders.  This tracks the intuitive unease with classified science.\n\nIX.  Wider Implications\n\nSeeing objectivity as warranted epistemic reliance offers guidance for policy and communication.\n\n1. Science Communication:  Public trust is rational only if journalists and scientists convey how independence, accessibility, and error correction are being maintained\u2014say, by releasing data, disclosing conflicts of interest, and explaining peer\u2010review procedures.\n\n2. Research Governance:  Funding diversity, open\u2010access mandates, whistle\u2010blower protections, and replication grants are not merely ethical niceties; they are pillars of objectivity.\n\n3. Expertise and Democracy:  Citizens need not become amateurs at everything; what they require is reassurance that the architecture of warranted reliance is intact.  Transparency about where that architecture is weak (e.g., in preliminary COVID\u201019 studies) helps calibrate justified trust.\n\nX.  Conclusion\n\nThe slogan \u201cobjectivity is what we can trust\u201d captures an important intuition but leaves the harder question unanswered:  *why* does objectivity license trust?  A more precise answer locates the unity of the diverse senses of objectivity in a common functional profile:  depersonalizing independence, public accessibility, and error\u2010correcting feedback that, together, render scientific outputs *worthy* of reliance by agents who cannot themselves replicate all the relevant work.  Trust is the rational attitude engendered by this profile; it is an interpersonal stance grounded in the objectivity, not identical with it.\n\nProcedural, convergent, and interactive objectivity are therefore not competing conceptions but complementary toolkits for building and maintaining the same underlying warrant.  Recognizing this helps in designing scientific institutions, communicating findings, and defending the epistemic authority of science without lapsing into either na\u00efve faith or corrosive skepticism.  In short:  objectivity earns trust by institutionalizing the conditions under which the community can justly hold each other\u2014and their claims\u2014accountable to the world.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 6, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 3755, "reasoning_tokens": 640}
{"question_id": "Koskinen-DefendingRiskAccount-2020", "question": "Several philosophers of science, including Arthur Fine and Heather Douglas, have suggested that the various applicable senses of scientific objectivity (such as procedural objectivity, convergent objectivity, and interactive objectivity) share a common basis in trust\u2014that when we call something objective, we indicate that it can be trusted. However, this characterization seems imprecise. What is the actual relationship between scientific objectivity and trust, and can we provide a more precise account of what unifies the different senses of objectivity?", "answer": "1. Introduction  \n\nWhen contemporary philosophers of science catalogue the varieties of scientific objectivity, they quickly accumulate a list: procedural objectivity (following impersonal rules), measurement or mechanical objectivity (letting the instrument \u201cspeak for itself\u201d), convergent objectivity (agreement or stability across researchers), interactive or critical\u2010dialogical objectivity (results that survive organised scrutiny), and still others. Faced with this motley array, Arthur Fine suggested that what binds them is simply that \u201cobjectivity\u201d marks something we can trust. Heather Douglas echoes the thought: claims to objectivity are, at bottom, invitations to place our epistemic trust in a method, a result, or a community. Yet, taken at face value, this identification is unsatisfactory. \u201cTrust\u201d is a psychological and normative attitude; \u201cobjectivity\u201d is ordinarily taken to name a property (of methods, results, or communities) that can justify that attitude. Conflating them risks obscuring both sides. The question, then, is twofold: (i) What, precisely, is the relation between objectivity and trust? (ii) Can we extract from that relation a unifying core that explains why the disparate senses of objectivity legitimately travel under a single banner?\n\nI propose the following answer. (1) Objectivity is a cluster property whose core is immunity to epistemically irrelevant, idiosyncratic factors\u2014those variations of standpoint, interest, or whim that, were they to affect a result, would undermine our warrant to rely on it. (2) Trust is a second\u2010order, normative stance agents may rationally adopt toward products or producers that reliably manifest that core property. Thus, objectivity is not identical with trust, but is instead the primary ground that makes a certain sort of trust\u2014epistemically responsible or justified trust\u2014appropriate. Because all the recognised senses of objectivity are strategies for securing, evidencing, or approximating that core immunity to idiosyncrasy, they are unified at a deeper level even though they operate by different mechanisms. What follows unpacks that proposal in detail.\n\n2. Clarifying \u201ctrust\u201d  \n\nWithin philosophical literature, \u201ctrust\u201d is distinguished from mere reliance. I may rely on my ageing alarm clock while harbouring no expectations about its intentions; I trust a friend when I count on her goodwill or competence under conditions of vulnerability. Epistemic trust focuses on competence and integrity: I accept a testimony, a data set, or a published result because I take its source to be both capable of getting things right and committed to doing so. Several features matter.\n\na. Opacity and vulnerability. Trust responds to situations where I cannot directly inspect all the grounds myself.  \nb. Normative expectations. I hold the trustee answerable if the expected competence or integrity is not met.  \nc. Risk. My own projects or beliefs stand to lose if trust is misplaced.\n\nIn scientific practice, laypersons trust scientists; scientists trust instrumentation, colleagues, journals, and statistical techniques. Trust is thus ubiquitous. Yet if objectivity were simply identical with \u201celiciting trust,\u201d then any widely trusted but epistemically worthless procedure would count as objective; conversely, early breakthroughs that were initially mistrusted would not. That does not accord with our reflective judgments. Hence objectivity must contribute something over and above psychological trust: it must be what makes the relevant trust reasonable.\n\n3. The varieties of objectivity  \n\nBefore unifying, we must sketch the diversity.\n\n3.1 Procedural objectivity (Daston & Galison). If observers follow a publicly specified protocol\u2014double\u2010blind trials, standard calibration\u2014they can, in principle, be replaced by any other trained observer without loss. The protocol, not the idiosyncratic skill or honesty of the individual, carries the epistemic weight.\n\n3.2 Mechanical or measurement objectivity. Photographs, automatic sensors, or computer scripts record phenomena without human \u201cinterference.\u201d Obviously, these devices embed design choices, yet the aspiration is the same: de-personalise the result.\n\n3.3 Convergent objectivity. A result is objective if independent lines of inquiry converge upon it: the mass of the electron, the phylogeny of whales, the acceleration of the universe. Here the stress lies on stability across investigative perspectives and historical time.\n\n3.4 Interactive or critical\u2010dialogical objectivity (Longino, Douglas). Results exposed to structured, open criticism, from diverse viewpoints, and revised accordingly can withstand the partialities of any one perspective.\n\n3.5 Quantificational or statistical objectivity (Hacking). Error analysis and significance testing provide numerical measures of how likely results are to have arisen by chance.\n\nAlthough these senses differ in operational details, each aims\u2014implicitly or explicitly\u2014to insulate claims from parochial factors that should not make a difference, thereby underwriting epistemic trust.\n\n4. Why \u201cobjectivity = trust\u201d is too coarse  \n\nSuppose a pharmaceutical company sponsors a trial, and through selective publication cultivates widespread professional reliance on a drug\u2019s efficacy. For a time, it is trusted. But later, when data manipulation is revealed, we retract both the trust and the label \u201cobjective.\u201d The moral is straightforward: the fact of being trusted is not sufficient for objectivity. Conversely, Gregor Mendel\u2019s genetics was objective\u2014his methods and results were eventually vindicated\u2014despite decades of neglect. So trust neither constitutes nor exhaustively tracks objectivity.\n\nNevertheless, Fine and Douglas are not wholly misguided: our practice of calling something \u201cobjective\u201d is connected to an invitation to trust. How? The key is that objectivity provides a reason to trust\u2014when, of course, agents recognise it. The connection is normative, not constitutive.\n\n5. A more precise account: objectivity as invariance under epistemically irrelevant changes  \n\nI propose that all the standard senses of objectivity instantiate a common aim: to achieve invariance with respect to variations that are epistemically irrelevant. Put more intuitively, an objective result is one that would be the same (within relevant error bounds) no matter which competent, well\u2010placed investigator obtained it, no matter her background assumptions, social identity, or personal interests, provided she followed the appropriately specified procedures. Such invariance blocks the route by which idiosyncratic biases could infect results. It does not require metaphysical perspective\u2010independence; rather, it is a practical, counterfactual robustness condition: results are resilient across a space of perspective changes that, looking back, we deem should not matter.\n\nDifferent senses of objectivity employ different strategies to secure or approximate that invariance.\n\na. Procedural objectivity achieves invariance by stringently constraining the procedure: if everyone follows the same recipe, personal quirks drop out.  \nb. Mechanical objectivity avoids subjective mediation by substituting automated recording devices for interpretation\u2010laden drawing or selection.  \nc. Convergent objectivity accumulates independent paths: if varied routes converge, we have evidence that earlier, pathway\u2010specific idiosyncrasies are cancelled.  \nd. Interactive objectivity manufactures robustness by exposing claims to heterogeneous criticism, thereby forcing revision until only claims resistant to the full range of pertinent standpoints survive.  \ne. Statistical objectivity renders the degree of chance error explicit, reducing dependence on anecdotal judgment.\n\nAlthough none of these strategies guarantees success, each offers a principled route to the same destination\u2014robustness across arbitrary changes in perspective that ought not epistemically matter.\n\n6. Why invariance justifies trust  \n\nReturn now to trust. If a result is invariant across epistemically irrelevant changes, then any agent aware of that fact possesses an undefeated reason to rely on the result even when she cannot replicate the work herself. In other words, the property of objectivity rationalises the attitude of trust by addressing its characteristic vulnerability: How do I know that this testimony or data set is not hostage to the quirks, interests, or errors of its producers? Objectivity answers: because the procedures, instruments, or critical interactions have filtered out those very quirks, interests, and errors. The better that filtering is documented, the stronger the warrant.\n\nNotice, too, that trust is always context\u2010sensitive. The needed degree of invariance varies with stakes. Climate projections used to regulate multi-trillion\u2010dollar policies demand a narrower margin of perspective\u2010free robustness than do predictions about bacterial growth in a high\u2010school lab. Our concept of objectivity is correspondingly elastic: the property is only instantiated relative to a contextually specified range of epistemically irrelevant variations and an acceptable error tolerance.\n\n7. Social epistemology and the economy of distributed expertise  \n\nModern science is unavoidably social. No individual can master all relevant instruments, statistical techniques, or disciplinary literatures. Consequently, distributed trust is constitutive of scientific knowledge. This social fact deepens the relation between objectivity and trust in three ways.\n\nFirst, the demand for objectivity is heightened because most scientists, most of the time, must rely on results they cannot personally vet. In Longino\u2019s phrase, \u201cobjectivity is the community\u2019s partial substitute for omniscience.\u201d Second, the social mechanisms that confer objectivity\u2014peer review, replication incentives, open data requirements, conflict\u2010of\u2010interest declarations\u2014are simultaneously mechanisms that constitute trustworthy disciplinary norms. Third, breakdowns in those mechanisms shift burdens: when journals suppress negative results or corporate funding compromises replication, the communal calculus of warranted trust erodes. The recent \u201creplication crisis\u201d in psychology provides a vivid illustration: confidence faltered when it became clear that extant procedural and statistical safeguards were insufficient to secure robustness across investigators.\n\n8. Objections and clarifications  \n\nObjection 1: Robustness across perspectives is itself a value\u2010laden judgment; who decides which variations are epistemically irrelevant? Response. Indeed, the scope of \u201cirrelevant\u201d is value\u2010laden and context\u2010dependent. That dependence is not an embarrassment; it means only that objectivity is indexed to a background of provisional commitments about what differences should matter. Exposing those commitments to critical interrogation is precisely the aim of interactive objectivity, thereby folding value\u2010awareness back into the process.\n\nObjection 2: The invariance account sounds disturbingly close to the discredited ideal of a \u201cview from nowhere.\u201d Response. It is crucial to distinguish between aiming for invariance across certain changes and pretending to achieve metaphysical perspective independence. The former is practical and incremental: we bracket concrete sources of bias we can identify. It recognises residual fallibility; future investigations may reveal that factors once deemed irrelevant do, after all, make a difference (e.g., sex differences in medical trials). Objectivity, so conceived, is corrigible and historically situated.\n\nObjection 3: Some scientific questions concern phenomena irreducibly sensitive to context (e.g., human behaviour). Does that doom objectivity? Response. No. The invariance test stipulates robustness only with respect to irrelevant variations. If the phenomenon is genuinely context\u2010sensitive, then context is epistemically relevant; good science will accordingly track, rather than abstract away from, those differences. Objectivity demands we distinguish chance or bias from genuine structure, not that we erase all variability.\n\n9. Relation to Fine, Douglas, and others  \n\nArthur Fine, in his \u201cletting the world decide,\u201d emphasised that when we call an observation objective, we gesture toward its \u201cvouchsafing\u201d role in inquiry\u2014the way it can be safely used downstream. Heather Douglas, from a values\u2010in\u2010science perspective, argues that objectivity is \u201cresponsibility to the phenomena and to the scientific community,\u201d ultimately underwriting warranted trust by signalling that an inquiry has met certain obligations of transparency, criticism, and responsiveness. Both capture an essential insight: objectivity functions, in practice, as a marker of epistemic trustworthiness.\n\nThe present account sharpens that insight by specifying (i) what must be true of methods or results for the trust to be epistemically warranted (robustness under irrelevant perspective changes) and (ii) how the different senses of objectivity are manoeuvres for achieving or demonstrating that robustness. It also aligns with Miriam Solomon\u2019s \u201csocial empiricism,\u201d which likens consensus\u2010seeking mechanisms to filters that amplify reliable indicators of the world. Yet it departs from any simple identification of objectivity with trust itself: trust is the attitude; objectivity is the property that justifies the attitude.\n\n10. Illustrative cases  \n\nCase 1: The kilogram prototype. For over a century, the international prototype kilogram in S\u00e8vres fixed the mass unit. Procedural objectivity was secured by strict protocols: the artifact was kept in a controlled environment, and national copies were calibrated against it. Trust in mass comparisons derived from the procedure\u2019s ability to detach the result from the idiosyncrasies of individual measurers. When slow drift in the prototype\u2019s mass became evident, trust eroded and the community shifted to defining the kilogram via Planck\u2019s constant\u2014an alternative expected to be invariant across even more potential sources of variation.\n\nCase 2: COVID\u201019 vaccine trials. Randomisation, double blinding, pre\u2010registered endpoints, and independent data monitoring committees are procedural safeguards. Global multiple trials supply convergent objectivity. Post-approval pharmacovigilance adds interactive objectivity by continually inviting criticism through data sharing. Collectively, these strategies offset interests of manufacturers, regional biases, and limited sample demographics. Public health agencies can therefore rationally ask citizens to trust the reported efficacy numbers, even though laypersons cannot verify the primary data themselves.\n\nCase 3: Gravitational waves. LIGO\u2019s detection depended on highly sensitive interferometers (mechanical objectivity), extensive simulations to identify and remove instrument noise (procedural objectivity), and the requirement that two geographically separated instruments record coincident signals (convergent objectivity). After years of null results, the eventual signal survived exhaustive cross\u2010checks\u2014interactive objectivity\u2014before publication. The robustness of the find across instruments, sites, and analytic pipelines grounds justified trust in the discovery.\n\n11. Consequences for policy and public understanding of science  \n\nIf objectivity underwrites warranted trust, then public controversies (climate change, vaccine efficacy, genetically modified organisms) often hinge less on technical details than on whether citizens perceive the relevant safeguards of invariance as credible. Communicating science, therefore, must do more than present results; it must make visible the layers of procedural, convergent, and interactive objectivity that give the results their claim to trustworthiness. Conversely, when scientists neglect transparency\u2014e.g., by withholding code or data\u2014they undercut the very property that legitimises civic trust. A precise understanding of the objectivity\u2013trust relation can thus guide institutional reforms: open data mandates, conflict-of-interest disclosures, replication grants, and diverse peer review panels all directly fortify objectivity by increasing robustness against idiosyncratic factors.\n\n12. Conclusion  \n\nThe multiplicity of objectivity\u2019s species reflects the complexity of insulating inquiry from the many ways human limitations and local interests can distort results. What unifies these species is not merely that they enjoy social trust, but that they each aim at\u2014and, when successful, achieve\u2014robustness under epistemically irrelevant variations of perspective. That property renders the corresponding trust rational. Scientific objectivity, then, is best understood as a family of practical strategies for producing results that remain stable when, counterfactually, different competent agents, with different contingent features, investigate the same phenomena by properly regulated means.\n\nTrust, in turn, is the normative attitude we are entitled to adopt once we have good reason to believe that robustness has been achieved. Recognising this layered relationship preserves Fine\u2019s and Douglas\u2019s central intuition while supplying the needed precision: objectivity does not collapse into trust; rather, objectivity is what makes trust epistemically responsible. By focusing on the core idea of invariance under irrelevant change, we gain a principled explanation of how procedural, mechanical, convergent, and interactive conceptions belong to the same conceptual family, and we obtain guidance for strengthening scientific practices\u2014and public confidence\u2014in the face of ever-evolving epistemic challenges.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 7, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 3827, "reasoning_tokens": 512}
{"question_id": "Koskinen-DefendingRiskAccount-2020", "question": "Several philosophers of science, including Arthur Fine and Heather Douglas, have suggested that the various applicable senses of scientific objectivity (such as procedural objectivity, convergent objectivity, and interactive objectivity) share a common basis in trust\u2014that when we call something objective, we indicate that it can be trusted. However, this characterization seems imprecise. What is the actual relationship between scientific objectivity and trust, and can we provide a more precise account of what unifies the different senses of objectivity?", "answer": "1. Introduction: the problem and the promise  \n\nFew words in the philosophical lexicon carry as much normative weight as \u201cobjective.\u201d  Scientists, policy\u2013makers and lay citizens alike treat the adjective as a stamp of epistemic authority.  Yet, as philosophers of science have been pointing out for several decades, the term is multiply-ambiguous.  Lorraine Daston and Peter Galison have traced a historical succession of ideals\u2014mechanical objectivity, structural objectivity, trained judgement\u2014while contemporary analytic discussion distinguishes, among others,\n\n\u2022 procedural objectivity (results you get whenever properly specified procedures are followed),  \n\u2022 convergent objectivity (results toward which multiple, independent lines of enquiry converge), and  \n\u2022 interactive objectivity (results that survive sustained critical interaction among diverse inquirers).\n\nArthur Fine in his \u201cNatural Ontological Attitude\u201d and Heather Douglas in Science, Policy and the Value-Free Ideal suggest that the thread uniting these senses is trust: to declare a claim or a method objective is, in effect, to say that it can be trusted.  Although attractive, the proposal sounds frustratingly imprecise.  Trust by whom?  In what?  And on what grounds?  Merely replacing \u201cobjective\u201d with \u201ctrustworthy\u201d would be verbal substitution, not philosophical illumination.\n\nMy aim is two-fold.  First, I offer a more fine-grained analysis of trust in light of the literature on the philosophy of trust (Baier 1986; Hardin 2002; Jones 2012).  Second, I show how the three best-known senses of scientific objectivity can be unified once we see objectivity as a family of bias-management strategies that earn, rather than presuppose, rationally grounded trust.  The unity lies neither in any single procedure nor in an abstract metaphysical property, but in the functional role objective methods play in stabilising warranted reliance across epistemic communities.\n\n2. What is trust?  A three-place relation under vulnerability  \n\nIn everyday speech we often conflate \u201crelying on\u201d with \u201ctrusting,\u201d but philosophical discussion has shown important nuances.  Annette Baier emphasises vulnerability; Karen Jones highlights an attitude of optimism about the trustee\u2019s good will; Russell Hardin foregrounds encapsulated interests.  What matters for present purposes is that trust is at least a three-place relation:\n\nT(A, B, \u03c6) = \u201cAgent A trusts agent (or system) B to do \u03c6,\u201d  \n\nwhere \u03c6 is the entrusted task, and where A\u2019s trusting involves:\n\n(a) An expectation that B will do \u03c6.  \n(b) A willingness to incur some vulnerability should B fail.  \n(c) A justification\u2014whether moral, prudential or epistemic\u2014for holding that expectation.\n\nIn science, the roles are unusual.  The trustee (B) need not be a person; it can be a measuring instrument, a statistical routine, a model, or an organised community.  The task \u03c6 is to produce true (or approximately true) statements about the world.  The truster (A) may be another scientist, an interdisciplinary collaborator, or a citizen who must base public policy on scientific advice.  The vulnerability consists in the costs\u2014intellectual, practical, even existential\u2014of error.\n\nSeen this way, Fine and Douglas are right: objectivity matters because it facilitates trust.  But we can now be more exacting: objectivity is not identical with trust; it is one among the warrant-generating conditions under which trust becomes rationally defensible.\n\n3. Bias-management: the functional core of objectivity  \n\nBias is a disposition for a belief-forming process to systematically deviate from the truth.  Biases can stem from human cognition (confirmation bias), social position (standpoint bias), technological design (calibration drift), or institutional incentives (publish-or-perish).  From the standpoint of an epistemic agent A considering whether to trust B with respect to \u03c6, the critical question is: Has B\u2019s procedure neutralised or at least contained those biases so that the expected truth ratio of its outputs is acceptably high?\n\nThis yields a functional conception of objectivity:\n\nObjectivity is the property of an epistemic process P such that, for a relevant audience A, P\u2019s output propositions are credibly insulated from idiosyncratic, bias-inducing factors that do not track the world.\n\nThe three standard senses\u2014procedural, convergent and interactive\u2014can now be interpreted as complementary strategies for bias-management.\n\n4. Procedural objectivity: depersonalising epistemic labour  \n\nThe nineteenth-century obsession with mechanical objectivity (Daston and Galison) tried to replace judgement with rule-following: let the camera, the spectroscope, or the statistical algorithm \u201cspeak for Nature\u201d while the scientist becomes an obedient scribe.  Contemporary procedural objectivity inherits this ideal but generalises it: any result that flows from a transparent, replicable protocol\u2014standardised reagents, preregistered hypotheses, pre-specified statistical tests, open data pipelines\u2014earns a presumption of objectivity.\n\nTrust analysis.  Who trusts whom to do what?  The community (A) trusts any properly trained practitioner (B) to generate reliable data (\u03c6) provided she scrupulously follows the protocol.  Vulnerability is lowered because:\n\n\u2022 Individual idiosyncrasies are \u201caveraged out\u201d by standardisation.  \n\u2022 Third parties can audit compliance ex post.  \n\u2022 Procedures can be replicated at will.\n\nYet procedural objectivity is not fool-proof.  Systematic error can be baked into the protocol itself, as seen in the replication crisis in psychology when default statistical thresholds (p < 0.05) proved too lenient.  Nor does procedure alone handle inductive risk: deciding how strong the evidence must be before accepting a hypothesis involves values, as Douglas has famously argued.  Hence the need for supplementary strategies.\n\n5. Convergent objectivity: independence and robustness  \n\nConvergence enters when multiple, independent methods point to the same conclusion\u2014e.g., the Avogadro constant measured via X-ray lattice spacing, silicon-sphere mass, and quantum electrical standards.  The mathematics of reliability theory shows why triangulation helps: if the probability that any single method yields the correct result is p > 0.5 and the methods are sufficiently independent, the joint probability that a consensus is correct rapidly approaches 1 with the number of concordant methods.\n\nTrust analysis.  Here the community (A) trusts the collective corpus of methods (B) to be reliable about proposition p (\u03c6) because their independence makes common-cause errors improbable.  Even if procedural weaknesses afflict one line of evidence, the error is unlikely to be mirrored in another that relies on different theoretical principles and instrumentation.\n\nConvergent objectivity has its limits.  Independence is rarely absolute; background theories, shared tooling, and social coordination can create hidden correlations.  Moreover, convergence is not always achievable: cutting-edge research often relies on a single novel technique.  Again, another strategy is needed.\n\n6. Interactive objectivity: critical contestation and standpoint pluralism  \n\nHelen Longino\u2019s contextual empiricism argues that objectivity requires not just multiple minds but disciplined, critical interaction among differently situated inquirers under norms of public reason: uptake of criticism, tempered equality of intellectual authority, and shared standards.  The presence of diverse standpoints (gender, ethnicity, disciplinary lens) is epistemically productive because each vantage exposes blind spots in the others, thereby rooting out bias that procedural rules and instrument-diversity may miss.\n\nTrust analysis.  The relevant audience (A), including outsiders, trusts a finding (\u03c6) insofar as it has survived vigorous yet fair scrutiny by an epistemically diverse community (B).  Vulnerability is mitigated because systematic distortion deriving from any one sub-group\u2019s interests or background assumptions is counteracted by equally empowered interlocutors.\n\nInteractive objectivity, too, can fail when power asymmetries stifle dissent, when gatekeeping journals filter out heterodox voices, or when sheer complexity makes criticism opaque.  Still, it supplies a dimension absent in the previous two strategies: social reflexivity.\n\n7. Unifying the three strategies: responsibility-transfer mechanisms  \n\nAlthough the strategies differ, they share a deeper architecture.  Each performs a responsibility-transfer: epistemic responsibility for truth is shifted away from any idiosyncratic agent toward structures\u2014protocols, networks of independent evidence, social critique\u2014that are, in principle, accessible and assessable by a wider audience.  The audience can therefore place rational trust in the output without having to form a personalised judgement about the goodwill or competence of each individual contributor.\n\nIn more formal terms, let R be the residual risk that a claim is false.  For a minimally rational truster A to adopt belief Bp in proposition p, R must fall below tolerance \u03c4.  The three kinds of objectivity furnish distinct but converging transformations T such that R\u2032 = T(R) < \u03c4:\n\n\u2022 Procedural transformation T\u2081: R\u2032 = R \u00d7 \u03b5\u2081, where \u03b5\u2081 quantifies error-reduction through standardisation.  \n\u2022 Convergent transformation T\u2082: R\u2032 = R\u1d4f, where k is the number of independent lines of evidence.  \n\u2022 Interactive transformation T\u2083: R\u2032 = R \u00d7 \u03b5\u2083, where \u03b5\u2083 mirrors bias-exposure through critical dialogue.\n\nThe unifying property is that each T lowers R by identifying and counteracting bias sources.  Accordingly, objectivity, in any of its senses, is a bias-mitigation function whose success licences well-grounded epistemic trust.\n\n8. Trust, reliance and legitimacy: clarifying the normative upshot  \n\nOne worry is that equating objectivity with trust might re-psychologise a notion that is supposed to be mind-independent: after all, objectivity should not wax and wane with public opinion polls.  The present account avoids that pitfall by tying objectivity to warranted trust, not mere de facto trust.  Warrant is anchored in publicly inspectable features of processes\u2014protocol transparency, evidential independence, discursive openness\u2014so that an informed sceptic could, in principle, verify that the risk-attenuation conditions obtain.\n\nA second worry is that trust involves goodwill, whereas instruments and procedures have no intentions.  Here Hardin\u2019s encapsulated-interest model is helpful: what the truster needs is not moral affection but reliable alignment of interests.  Plastic film on X-ray plates does not have goodwill, but it has physically law-like behaviour that aligns with our interest in accurate diffraction patterns.  Thus, in scientific contexts, trust often collapses into warranted reliance.  Objectivity, so understood, is precisely what renders such reliance rational.\n\n9. How the account helps with long-standing puzzles  \n\na) The underdetermination problem.  Objectivity as bias-management does not eliminate underdetermination by data, but it shrinks the space of credible theories by discounting those that owe their appeal to undocumented biases.\n\nb) Value-ladenness.  Douglas shows that non-epistemic values legitimately enter science whenever choices affect the consequences of error.  Our account predicts this: values guide where to place \u03c4, the tolerance threshold for residual risk.  Objectivity, therefore, is not value-free; it is value-responsive in a transparent way that permits stakeholders to contest the choice of \u03c4.\n\nc) Science communication.  In an era of misinformation, citizens ask, \u201cWhy should we trust the experts?\u201d  Pointing to procedural, convergent and interactive safeguards supplies a substantive answer.  Transparency about how these safeguards operate can cultivate informed trust without slipping into blind deference.\n\n10. Objections and replies  \n\nObjection 1: Bias-management is purely negative; it tells us how to avoid error, not how to attain truth.  \nReply: Eliminating systematic deviation is half the job.  Randomised error remains, but as long as it is unbiased, truth can be approached through statistical aggregation.  Moreover, many scientific instruments are calibrated against natural standards (e.g., the cesium hyperfine frequency), providing positive ties to reality.\n\nObjection 2: The view seems circular: we trust procedures because they are objective and we call them objective because we trust them.  \nReply: The circle is broken by independent, historically traceable validation.  Protocols earn the label \u201cobjective\u201d only after empirical meta-studies show that they deliver reliable predictions and withstand critical challenge.  The causal order runs from demonstrated reliability to justified trust to the ascription of objectivity.\n\nObjection 3: Diversity requirements in interactive objectivity risk politicising science.  \nReply: The requirement is epistemic, not ideological.  Standpoint diversity is instrumental to detecting bias that correlates with social position.  The aim is not to inject politics but to neutralise unrecognised political infiltrations already present.\n\n11. Extensions: beyond the three classical senses  \n\nRecent developments suggest further trust-securing strategies\u2014algorithmic transparency in machine learning, preregistration in field ecology, citizen-science auditing of big data\u2014that can be subsumed under the same functional core.  Likewise, reproducibility initiatives blend procedural (registered reports) and convergent (multi-lab replications) tactics with interactive components (open peer review).  The framework thus scales with evolving research practices.\n\n12. Conclusion: from imprecision to precision  \n\nFine and Douglas were right to link objectivity with trust, for both terms answer to the same normative aspiration: to make cognitive reliance safe in a world where fallibility and bias are ubiquitous.  The link becomes precise once we:\n\n(1) Analyse trust as a three-place relation under vulnerability.  \n(2) Identify bias-management as the functional essence of objectivity.  \n(3) Show how procedural, convergent and interactive objectivity instantiate complementary responsibility-transfer mechanisms that render trust rational.\n\nUnder this account, calling a result \u201cobjective\u201d is neither a magical incantation nor an empty honorific.  It is a concise way of signalling: \u201cThe processes that produced this claim have navigated the minefield of bias by means X, Y, Z; therefore you may rationally, though always defeasibly, place your epistemic trust here.\u201d  In the last analysis, objectivity is trustworthy not because we decree it so, but because we have good, publicly available reasons\u2014procedural, evidential and social\u2014to believe that it earns our trust.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 8, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 3630, "reasoning_tokens": 576}
{"question_id": "Koskinen-DefendingRiskAccount-2020", "question": "Several philosophers of science, including Arthur Fine and Heather Douglas, have suggested that the various applicable senses of scientific objectivity (such as procedural objectivity, convergent objectivity, and interactive objectivity) share a common basis in trust\u2014that when we call something objective, we indicate that it can be trusted. However, this characterization seems imprecise. What is the actual relationship between scientific objectivity and trust, and can we provide a more precise account of what unifies the different senses of objectivity?", "answer": "1. Introduction  \n\nWhen we say that a scientific result is objective, we do more than voice a compliment. We license its use as evidence in policy, medicine, engineering, and everyday deliberation. Unsurprisingly, philosophers of science who are alert to the social consequences of science have interpreted the rhetoric of objectivity as a rhetoric of trust. Arthur Fine writes that \u201cobjective\u201d is nothing more than a success term: to call a claim objective is simply to mark it as something we can rely on. Heather Douglas likewise treats talk of objectivity as shorthand for warranted public confidence. Yet if objectivity is merely \u201cwhat can be trusted,\u201d the notion dissolves into a thin label for credibility, and the various historically entrenched senses of objectivity\u2014procedural, convergent, interactive, pragmatic, ontological\u2014look like disconnected cultural inventions. The pressing philosophical question is therefore twofold: (1) What is the precise relation between objectivity and trust? and (2) Is there something more substantive that unifies the several senses of objectivity employed in scientific practice?  \n\nI shall argue that the link is neither identity nor mere correlation. Objectivity is a property of epistemic products and processes; trust is an attitude of agents who must depend on those products and processes. What unifies the different senses of objectivity is that each offers a distinct strategy for making a community\u2019s unavoidable epistemic dependence into a rational form of trust. Objectivity, in other words, is best understood as the management of epistemic dependence in such a way that responsible trust\u2014trust backed by reasons\u2014is appropriate. Put programmatically: scientific procedures, consensus-forming mechanisms, and critical interactions are \u201cobjective\u201d insofar as they render the acceptance of a claim resilient under wide counterfactual variation of perspective; they secure an attitude-independent warrant. The result is a single explanatory core beneath the family of objectivity concepts and a clarified, non-reductive relation to trust.\n\n2. Survey of the classical senses  \n\nBefore defending this proposal, it will be useful to recall what philosophers have meant by the flagship notions.  \n\na. Procedural objectivity, associated with 19th-century laboratory cultures and later with statistics, promises impartiality through codified, often mechanical, rules. Measurements undertaken with standardised instruments, double-blind randomised trials, and algorithmic data pipelines exemplify the strategy: engineer the procedure so that individual temperaments, hopes, and values cannot influence the result.  \n\nb. Convergent (or concordant) objectivity, first thematised by Kant and later by Helmholtz and Reichenbach, roots objectivity in the convergence of independent investigators\u2019 findings. If observers using different techniques, conceptual schemes, or social positions nonetheless arrive at the same quantitative determinations of Avogadro\u2019s number or the same spatiotemporal map of cosmic background radiation, we judge the result objective in virtue of that robust intersection.  \n\nc. Interactive or critical-community objectivity, developed in feminist philosophy of science by Helen Longino and refined by Douglas herself, locates objectivity not in impersonality but in the possibility of sustained mutual criticism within inclusive epistemic communities. The key idea is that bias is controlled when heterogeneous interlocutors are positioned to scrutinise, challenge, and amend one another\u2019s evidential standards and auxiliary assumptions.   \n\nThere are additional coins in the objectivity currency\u2014ontological objectivity (mind-independent existence of the referent) and measurement objectivity (instrumental invariance), for instance\u2014but the three above suffice to illustrate the diversity puzzling us.\n\n3. Fine\u2019s and Douglas\u2019s \u201ctrust\u201d theses  \n\nArthur Fine\u2019s notorious \u201cNOA\u201d (Natural Ontological Attitude) instructs us to accept the products of successful science \u201cas trustworthy.\u201d He explicitly rejects any deeper metaphysical or methodological account, claiming that what we call \u201cobjective\u201d is simply what has earned our practical confidence. Douglas, though more nuanced, likewise adjusts the compass toward public trust. She stresses that modern societies are forced into relations of epistemic dependence\u2014a citizen must depend on toxicologists, climatologists, and epidemiologists\u2014so objectivity talk functions to reassure us that this dependence need not be blind. Both authors are right in highlighting the socio-epistemic role of trust, but neither supplies an analysis robust enough to explain why particular procedures, convergences, or interactions yield trustworthiness rather than mere agreement or ritual. Nor do they separate (i) the normative property that warrants trust from (ii) the trusting attitude itself.\n\n4. Clarifying the concept of trust  \n\nContemporary analytic work on trust shows that it is a three-place relation: A trusts B to do X. It involves reliance plus a normative attitude\u2014A depends on B, believes B competent and benevolent with respect to X, and is thereby vulnerable. Crucially, trust can be warranted or unwarranted. Fake news sites seek trust; genuine medical laboratories hope to deserve it. So if objectivity is to underwrite responsible trust, it must not collapse into whatever people happen to rely on. We need criteria that distinguish well-grounded reliance from naive faith. These criteria, I claim, are exactly what the diverse practices of objectivity try to supply.\n\n5. Epistemic dependence as the strategic target  \n\nNo scientist, policymaker, or layperson can verify more than a sliver of modern science by herself. Dependence on testimony, instrumentation, statistical expertise, and peer interpretation is inevitable. Epistemic dependence is both the problem and the engine of collective inquiry: without sharing results we would know little; with unfiltered deference we risk error and manipulation. Objectivity is best seen as a suite of cultural technologies for regulating this dependence so that trust becomes rational. Instead of trying (hopelessly) to eradicate dependence, science domesticates it. It constructs procedures, convergence tests, and accountability mechanisms that insulate the final product from any one person\u2019s interests or standpoint. When successful, the product is \u201cobjective\u201d because its warrant does not derive from the particularities of the individuals who accept it. From the user\u2019s perspective, the objectivity architecture delivers a *basis* for trust, not the trust itself.\n\n6. A precisifying proposal: the Independence-Resilience Account  \n\nThe proposal can be put more formally:\n\nObjectivity (of a claim, measurement, or model) is the degree to which its epistemic warrant is resilient under counterfactual variation of individual perspectives within the relevant competence domain.\n\nIn other words, take a pool of inquirers who satisfy minimal epistemic virtues (honesty, basic methodological literacy). Vary their personal aims, backgrounds, and sensory impressions. If, after their exposure to the publicly accessible evidence and inferential steps, they would still converge on acceptance of the claim, then the claim is objective to that extent.\n\nWhy does this unify the classic senses?\n\n\u2022 Procedural objectivity secures independence by substituting rule-following and instrumentation for personal judgment, thereby ensuring that variation in experimenters\u2019 values or cognitive styles does not ripple into the result.  \n\u2022 Convergent objectivity checks independence *ex post*: even if idiosyncrasies operated during data collection, the overlap of conclusions across diverse inquirers demonstrates resilience to perspectival variation.  \n\u2022 Interactive objectivity secures independence diachronically: structured critical dialogue actively exposes and corrects perspective-sensitive error, again promoting resilience under counterfactual standpoint variation.\n\nAll three, then, aim at the same independence-resilience property but implement it differently\u2014through ex ante depersonalisation, ex post concurrence, or ongoing mutual scrutiny. The account therefore explains both the unity (common target) and the diversity (distinct engineering solutions) of objectivity concepts.\n\n7. From objectivity to warranted trust  \n\nGiven this account, the relation between objectivity and trust becomes transparent: objectivity is the set of features that make certain forms of trust epistemically responsible. Put in the idiom of virtue epistemology, objectivity turns a community\u2019s dependence into a virtue-constitutive relation rather than a vice-constitutive one. If a claim meets the independence-resilience criterion, then even agents who cannot replicate the entire inquiry are justified in relying on it; their vulnerability is mitigated by knowledge that acceptance is not hostage to any private agenda.\n\nThus we avoid two errors:\n\n\u2022 Reductionism: objectivity is *not* identical with trust. Plenty of social processes (charismatic authority, echo chambers) generate trust without objectivity.  \n\u2022 Alienation: objectivity is *for* trust. Its point would evaporate if agents never had to decide whether to rely on scientific outputs.\n\n8. Objections and replies  \n\nObjection 1: A claim can be resilient across perspectives yet false. Historical counterexamples\u2014the caloric theory, Ptolemaic astronomy\u2014enjoyed wide convergence for centuries. How does the account handle such cases?  \nReply: Objectivity is not infallibility. The caloric theory was objectively warranted relative to the 18th-century evidential base, and therefore trusting it was rational at the time. Objectivity is a synchronic, context-relative property, not a guarantee of truth. The same applies to risk assessment in policy: decisions must be made under current evidence.  \n\nObjection 2: Values pervade scientific inference (Douglas\u2019s own argument against the value-free ideal). If the independence-resilience criterion brackets values, we mischaracterise actual practice.  \nReply: The criterion does not require value-neutrality; it requires transparency and critical contestability of value-laden choices. If researchers disclose modelling choices, uncertainty tolerances, and policy freighted assumptions, then alternative perspectives can test whether conclusions survive replacement of those assumptions. That is precisely how interactive objectivity handles inductive risk.  \n\nObjection 3: Trust is also affected by extra-epistemic factors: economic interests, institutional histories, structural injustice. Does the emphasis on epistemic resilience ignore legitimate social distrust?  \nReply: It is a virtue of the account that it highlights these extra-epistemic obstacles. If pharmaceutical funding structures systematically filter out unfavourable results, then perspective variation (e.g., inclusion of independent public-sector labs) would produce divergence, revealing lack of objectivity. Social distrust can therefore be well-grounded or ill-grounded, depending on whether the independence-resilience architecture is intact or compromised.\n\n9. Comparative advantages of the proposal  \n\na. Explanatory depth: It reveals why distinct practices that look unrelated (double-blind randomisation, replication across cultures, feminist standpoint critique) count as objectivity-conferring: each tackles the same independence problem.  \n\nb. Normative guidance: It delivers a metric for institutional design. Where procedures fail to anticipate sources of dependence\u2014say, algorithmic opacity in machine-learning based diagnostics\u2014we know objectivity is at risk until compensatory convergence tests or critical interactions are installed.  \n\nc. Compatibility with pluralism: The account recognises that the independence-resilience threshold can vary across contexts. For urgent public health decisions, moderate resilience may suffice; for foundational physics, we may demand extreme independence delivered by million-dollar accelerators and global replication networks.  \n\n10. Conclusion  \n\nThe slogan \u201cobjectivity means we can trust it\u201d is not wrong, but it is philosophically incomplete. Trust is an attitude grounded in vulnerability; objectivity is the structured response to that vulnerability. Scientific communities cultivate objectivity by engineering epistemic products whose acceptance is resilient under wide counterfactual variation of perspective. Procedural, convergent, and interactive objectivity are not competing ideals but complementary techniques for achieving the same overarching aim: the rational management of epistemic dependence. Once this architecture is in place, trust\u2014public confidence, policy reliance, personal deferential belief\u2014is not a leap but a warranted step. Thus objectivity and trust are partners rather than twins: objectivity earns, and thereby legitimises, the trust on which our shared epistemic life depends.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 9, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 3076, "reasoning_tokens": 576}

We invoke it to vindicate climate\u2013model projections, particle-physics data, randomized\u2010controlled trials in medicine, and even the conclusions of historically oriented disciplines such as paleoanthropology. Yet when philosophers list the varieties of objectivity that are in play\u2014\u201cprocedural,\u201d \u201cconvergent,\u201d \u201contic,\u201d \u201cmeasurement,\u201d \u201cinteractive,\u201d \u201cregulatory,\u201d and so on\u2014many worry that the notion is poised to disintegrate into an unmanageable plurality. To counteract that danger, Arthur Fine, Heather Douglas, and several others have suggested that the varieties are held together by a unifying theme: calling a result objective signals that \u201cit can be trusted.\u201d While this is certainly in the right vicinity\u2014objectivity is supposed to deliver dependable information\u2014\u201ctrust\u201d is an imprecise notion.

I then argue that the relationship between objectivity and trust is best conceived as indirect and two-tiered: objectivity is fundamentally a property of epistemic procedures and products that makes them reliably truth-conducive under conditions of public scrutiny; trust is the second-order attitude that rational agents may adopt toward those procedures and products once they recognize that the relevant conditions obtain. On this basis we can supply a more precise unifying account: all the legitimate senses of \u201cscientific objectivity\u201d are institutionalized strategies for securing the counterfactual stability of epistemic outputs against idiosyncratic biases, and thereby for satisfying the reasonable trust of an indefinitely large community of would-be critics. The key ingredients across the varieties are (i) independence constraints, (ii) evidential responsiveness, and (iii) transparency to critical uptake. The familiar labels\u2014procedural objectivity, convergent objectivity, interactive objectivity, and so forth\u2014designate different practical ways of implementing the same three-part recipe.\n\n1. Varieties of objectivity: brief orientation\n------------------------------------------------\nProcedural objectivity, the paradigm championed by 19th-century metrology and later by experimental psychology, requires that investigators follow explicitly codified protocols. If operators can be swapped out without affecting a measurement\u2019s outcome, the result is deemed objective. Convergent objectivity, stressed by C. S. Peirce and later philosophers of science, attaches to statements whose truth would be stably agreed upon by competent inquirers in the long run, regardless of their antecedent opinions. Interactive or deliberative objectivity\u2014highlighted by Helen Longino and by Douglas herself\u2014arises from structured critical dialogue in which diverse perspectives are encouraged to expose hidden assumptions and correct errors.\n\nThere are further species (ontic objectivity, truth-to-nature, modeling objectivity, etc.), but the above three suffice to display the tension: procedural objectivity is first-order and rule-oriented; convergent objectivity is counterfactual and diachronic; interactive objectivity is socio-political and dialogical. What could possibly unify them? Fine\u2019s and Douglas\u2019s proposal is that each, in its way, earns our trust. But unless we unpack the concept of trust, the answer threatens to reduce to a platitude: \u201cobjective claims are claims we should believe.\u201d We need to know: trust whom (persons, machines, institutions, the data, nature)? trust for what purpose (prediction, control, explanation, policy)? and, most importantly, on what rational basis?\n\n2. Trust: reliance, normative expectations, and vulnerability\n-------------------------------------------------------------\nPhilosophical work on trust\u2014by Baier, Hardin, Jones, Hawley, O\u2019Neill, among others\u2014converges on three common threads.\n\na. A stands in a trust relation to B regarding \u03d5 just if A is voluntarily vulnerable to B\u2019s discretionary power over whether \u03d5 is realized.\n\nb. Trust involves normative expectations: the trustee is obliged (morally, epistemically, or professionally) to act in ways that protect the truster\u2019s interests.\n\nc. Trust is distinguishable from mere reliance; when trust is betrayed, resentment or blame is appropriate, not merely disappointment.\n\nScientific objectivity obviously intersects with these themes. Citizens rely on climate scientists to deliver trustworthy projections because policy decisions put them in a position of vulnerability. However, many instances of alleged objectivity occur in contexts\u2014say, the storage-ring measurement of the muon\u2019s g-2\u2014in which no person is explicitly asking anyone to protect them. The relevant attitude seems closer to epistemic entitlement or rational licensing than to an interpersonal moral relation.\n\nHence, for the slogan to be illuminating, \u201ctrust\u201d must be understood in the specifically epistemic sense explicated by Karen Jones: a trust that B will tell one what is true about domain D, grounded in B\u2019s competence and epistemic conscientiousness, and importing a right to complain should B\u2019s testimony be careless or fraudulent. Call this \u201cepistemic trust.\u201d\n\n3. Objectivity as the basis, trust as the attitude\n--------------------------------------------------\nOnce trust is so understood, the relationship to objectivity can be sharpened.\n\n(i) Objectivity is a first-order property of methods and outputs: it is the property of being produced by epistemic practices that would robustly yield approximately true beliefs across a sufficiently wide range of counterfactual conditions\u2014conditions that include changes of personnel, background assumptions, and salient value-orientations.\n\n(ii) Epistemic trust is a second-order reactive attitude that is rationally permitted when (i) is satisfied and the audience is justified in believing that (i) is satisfied.\n\nIn short: objectivity grounds trust; trust does not constitute objectivity. That is why we can have objectively excellent results that are not in fact trusted (because the public is unaware of them) and, conversely, misplaced trust in results that only pretend to objectivity (due to propaganda or miscommunication). The imprecision of Fine and Douglas stems from running together the metaphysical ground with its rational-pragmatic consequence.\n\n4. The unifying recipe: independence, evidential responsiveness, transparency\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nConsider the three paradigms again.\n\n1. Procedural objectivity secures INDEPENDENCE by scripting the operator\u2019s actions, thereby screening off the effects of individual skill, bias, or desire. The protocol also codifies EVIDENTIAL RESPONSIVENESS: the measurement reading is physically coupled to the phenomenon rather than to the experimenter\u2019s will. Finally, by publishing the protocol, TRANSPARENCY is achieved; any skeptic can audit the steps.\n\n2. Convergent objectivity foregrounds EVIDENTIAL RESPONSIVENESS: reality itself is supposed to exert a constraining pressure that drives beliefs toward a unique fixed point. But Peircean convergence also presupposes INDEPENDENCE (idiosyncratic starting points are \u201cwashed out\u201d by ongoing inquiry) and TRANSPARENCY (the ideal of unlimited inquirers sharing data).\n\n3. Interactive objectivity makes TRANSPARENCY and social criticism its leading edge: exposing claims to differently situated critics flushes out local blind spots. But the practice only works when critics are epistemically INDEPENDENT (not co-opted) and when discourse remains tethered to EVIDENCE.\n\nThus each variety is best viewed not as a rival but as emphasizing one or another dimension of a common architecture. The deeper unity is functional: all three dimensions aim to construct procedures whose deliverances are counterfactually stable under substitution of inquirers and under the pressure of further evidence and criticism.\n\n5. Why counterfactual stability?\n--------------------------------\nObjectivity\u2019s raison d\u2019\u00eatre is the finitude and fallibility of particular investigators. Human observers are partial, motivated, error-prone, and bear localized pictures of the world. An objective procedure is one that would, with high probability, have produced the same\u2014or at least sufficiently similar\u2014outcome even had different competent observers, equipped with the same information and bound by the same shared norms, been in charge. This is the \u201cwould survive relevant variations\u201d property that philosophers of measurement call robustness and statisticians call reliability. The counterfactual element is crucial: objectivity is not merely a matter of causal insensitivity to human foibles (machines malfunction too) but a matter of principle: any legitimate would-be critic, armed with public standards, has the possibility of replicating or recalculating the result and would thereby obtain confirmatory evidence.\n\nRobust counterfactual stability is what rationally licenses epistemic trust. If a procedure is such that any competent and conscientious inquirer could, in principle, check or replicate it, then we, who may lack the expertise or resources to do so ourselves, are entitled to trust the result\u2014conditional on our trust in the social institutions that enforce competence and conscientiousness.\n\n6. Objections and replies\n-------------------------\nObjection 1: Cases exist where we justifiably trust even non-objective sources (e.g., a friend\u2019s testimony about yesterday\u2019s bus schedule). Hence trust cannot be downstream of objectivity alone.\n\nReply: The account does not deny that many grounds can underwrite trust. It claims only that when we invoke the honorific \u201cobjective,\u201d the trust we intend to license flows specifically from the tri-fold structure of independence, evidential responsiveness, and transparency. Ordinary testimonial trust may be perfectly rational yet remain a different beast.\n\nObjection 2: High-stakes policy contexts often require trust despite the impossibility of realizing public transparency\u2014for instance, classified intelligence. Does the account imply that no such conclusions can be objective?\n\nReply: The variables are a matter of degree. Partial or proxy transparency (e.g., independent but trusted oversight bodies) can suffice, provided that critics outside the initial circle are in principle able to gain access given legitimate cause. Objectivity is not an all-or-nothing label; rather, the more restrictive the channel, the more fragile the resulting entitlement to trust.\n\nObjection 3: Interactive objectivity stresses the role of value-diversity in exposing assumptions. How does that square with the present emphasis on truth-conduciveness? Aren\u2019t values irreducibly involved?\n\nReply: Values are indeed part of the evidential responsiveness dimension. Choices about what counts as relevant evidence, which modeling assumptions are acceptable, and which explanatory virtues matter, are value-laden. What the tri-fold architecture requires is that these choices be made explicit and remain open to critique by inquirers with alternative value commitments. Thus value-sensitivity is not a threat but an ingredient.\n\n7. Implications for contemporary controversies\n----------------------------------------------\nThe account illuminates current debates in several ways.\n\na. Algorithmic objectivity. When machine-learning systems are praised as \u201cobjective,\u201d the compliment is justified only if the training data, model selection, and evaluation metrics satisfy independence (protection against encoded biases), evidential responsiveness (genuine signal rather than artifact), and transparency (auditability). Black-box systems that cannot be meaningfully interrogated might deliver accurate predictions, but they lack the features that warrant public trust in the stricter sense.\n\nb. Replication crisis in psychology and biomedicine. Failures of replication reveal that independence and evidential responsiveness were over-estimated. Deferred trust is an appropriate response, and reforms such as preregistration, registered reports, and data-sharing are attempts to restore the tri-fold architecture.\n\nc. Citizen science and lay participation. Interactive objectivity suggests that bringing heterogeneous perspectives into the evidential pipeline (e.g., Indigenous ecological knowledge in environmental science) can enhance objectivity by surfacing assumptions invisible to professionals. The tri-fold recipe provides criteria for distinguishing fruitful inclusion from politicized tokenism.\n\n8. Relation to realism and anti-realism\n---------------------------------------\nDoes the proposed account collapse objectivity into social epistemology, thereby threatening realism? Not at all. The world\u2019s causal structure is indispensable to the second ingredient, evidential responsiveness. Procedures that merely track consensus, power, or cultural prestige but are insensitive to the world cannot maintain counterfactual stability under widened scrutiny; their outputs will fail when put to novel empirical tests. Conversely, anti-realist worries about inaccessible \u201cGod\u2019s-eye views\u201d are deflated: the account requires only that our practices be robustly self-correcting, not that we attain metaphysical correspondence once and for all.\n\n9. Summary and conclusion\n-------------------------\nWe can now state the relationship between scientific objectivity and trust with greater precision.\n\n1. Scientific objectivity is a property of epistemic procedures and products characterized by the following three jointly necessary and jointly sufficient features:\n\n   (a) Independence: They minimize the influence of any individual agent\u2019s idiosyncrasies by formal, mechanical, or social partitioning of control.\n\n   (b) Evidential responsiveness: They are tightly coupled to empirical reality in ways that make errors detectable and corrigible.\n\n   (c) Transparency to critical uptake: They make the materials, assumptions, and inferential steps available (in principle) to an open community of competent critics.\n\n2. When (1) is satisfied and when audiences are justified in believing that (1) is satisfied, those audiences are rationally licensed to adopt an attitude of epistemic trust toward the outputs\u2014where that attitude includes reliance plus the normative expectation of conscientious truth-telling.\n\n3. The familiar typology (procedural, convergent, interactive, etc.) consists of concrete strategies for implementing one or more of (1a\u2013c) under different historical and technological constraints. Their unity is functional, not semantic: each is a tool for securing counterfactual robustness, hence a warrant for trust.\n\nThus Fine and Douglas are right to see a deep association between objectivity and trust, but the direction of dependence and the mechanism of unification need sharpening. Objectivity does not rest on trust; rather, trustworthy science rests on objective practices, where objectivity is explicable in terms of independence, evidential responsiveness, and transparency. Under this interpretation, calling a claim \u201cobjective\u201d is a shorthand for a complex institutional guarantee: \u201cYou may trust this, because it would survive the process of being checked by any competent inquirer whatever\u2014 including you, were you to undertake the necessary inquiry.\u201d", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 10, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 3406, "reasoning_tokens": 384}
{"question_id": "Koskinen-DefendingRiskAccount-2020", "question": "Several philosophers of science, including Arthur Fine and Heather Douglas, have suggested that the various applicable senses of scientific objectivity (such as procedural objectivity, convergent objectivity, and interactive objectivity) share a common basis in trust\u2014that when we call something objective, we indicate that it can be trusted. However, this characterization seems imprecise. What is the actual relationship between scientific objectivity and trust, and can we provide a more precise account of what unifies the different senses of objectivity?", "answer": "Objectivity and Trust: Towards a Unified Account  \n\n1. Introduction  \n\n\u201cObjectivity\u201d is one of the most prized but also most contested ideals of the sciences. Philosophers have catalogued a bewildering variety of senses in which a practice, result, or institution may be called objective: procedural or \u201cmechanical\u201d objectivity (Daston & Galison), aperspectival or \u201cconvergent\u201d objectivity (Lonergan, Reichenbach), interactive objectivity (Longino), ontological objectivity (Searle), measurement objectivity (Tal), and so on. Faced with this diversity, a common temptation is to look for a single, thin core that underwrites them all. Arthur Fine (1998) and, more recently, Heather Douglas (2020) have suggested that the relevant unifying core is trust. When scientists call a result objective, they allegedly signal that the result \u201ccan be trusted\u201d\u2014that it is worthy of the confidence of both experts and laypersons.  \n\nThe suggestion is illuminating, but also clearly incomplete. All sorts of things are trusted\u2014teachers, parents, software, and religion\u2014without thereby being called objective. Conversely, some statements or instruments might qualify as objective while still being distrusted by some parties, perhaps due to political or cultural reasons. Simply equating objectivity with trust thus collapses an important conceptual distinction between the epistemic features that ground warranted trust and the psychological\u2010social attitude of trust itself. So how exactly are the two related? And can the relation between them show us what unifies the disparate family of objectivity concepts?\n\nIn what follows I defend three main theses.  \n\n1. The primary role of objectivity talk in scientific discourse is normative\u2010epistemic: it is used to mark those products, processes, and practices whose acceptance ought to be insensitive to the idiosyncratic features of particular inquirers.  \n2. Trust enters this picture as a second\u2010order attitude that is rational just when the relevant insensitivity condition is satisfied. Objectivity is thus not identical with trust; rather, it is the epistemic property that licenses well\u2010grounded trust.  \n3. The diverse species of objectivity popular in the philosophical literature can all be seen as strategies for achieving one and the same underlying condition, which I call robustness under irrelevant variation. Each variety of objectivity secures robustness by targeting a different sort of potential variability\u2014of persons, perspectives, or procedures.  \n\nBy treating robustness under irrelevant variation (RIV) as the shared functional core, we can explain why objectivity is so closely linked to trust while still accounting for the multiplicity of legitimate objectivity ideals operating in science.\n\n2. What Is At Stake in Calling Something \u201cObjective\u201d?  \n\nTo see why objectivity talk is needed at all, recall a familiar tension at the heart of empirical inquiry. Scientific knowledge is produced by historically situated, socially embedded, fallible persons. Yet the authority of science rests on the supposition that its results transcend any individual\u2019s idiosyncrasies\u2014otherwise why should anyone outside the original research group care? The early modern project of a \u201cview from nowhere\u201d expressed a hope that method\u2014if sufficiently strict\u2014could convert subjective sensory data into public, impersonal knowledge. Though the dream of a literally perspective\u2010free standpoint has been given up, the underlying desideratum persists: results ought to be acceptable regardless of who produced them, provided only that the producers were minimally competent and sincere.  \n\nCall this desideratum impartial acceptability. Speaking historically, scientific communities have invented different tools for achieving it (standardised laboratory protocols, double\u2010blinding, independent replication, adversarial peer review, etc.). Philosophers catalogue these tools under different headings\u2014procedural objectivity for rule\u2010following methods, convergent or aperspectival objectivity for the agreement of independent observers, interactive objectivity for the regulated contest between rival social perspectives, and so on. Although heterogeneous in form, these devices share a functional aim: to secure impartial acceptability by insulating claims from irrelevant fluctuations in who happens to be doing the work.  \n\n3. Trust as an Epistemic Attitude  \n\nWhat, then, is trust? At minimum, to trust X (where X can be a person, instrument, or claim) is:\na. To rely on X in one\u2019s practical or epistemic ventures, and  \nb. To hold the normative expectation that X will not betray that reliance.  \n\nTrust is thus both dispositional (one builds further inferences or actions upon X) and normative (one sees X as warrantedly reliable). Truistic as this may sound, the point is that trust has an evidential basis; rational agents seek grounds for the expectation component. The relevant grounds vary with context\u2014personal character in interpersonal trust, institutional safeguards in political trust, and methodological virtues in epistemic trust.  \n\nFine (1998) observes that when scientists label a result \u201cobjective\u201d they typically do so in contexts that call for public endorsement\u2014e.g., regulatory policy, interdisciplinary citation, or science communication. The label functions rhetorically to defuse suspicions of bias: \u201cDon\u2019t worry; this is objective.\u201d Douglas echoes the idea, noting that objectivity claims \u201cwork linguistically to build trust in scientific claims.\u201d  \n\nThese sociolinguistic observations are correct but do not yet yield an analysis. Shouting \u201cobjective!\u201d is, at best, a speech act that invites trust; it does not itself specify the conditions under which such trust would be reasonable. A philosophical account must articulate what, in reality, makes the invitation legitimate. My proposal is that the legitimacy derives from the satisfaction of the RIV condition.\n\n4. Robustness Under Irrelevant Variation (RIV)  \n\nDefining the Core  \n\nLet a claim, measurement, or inferential step be robust under irrelevant variation just in case:  \n\nRIV: For any variation among competent, sincere inquirers in respects extraneous to the truth of the target proposition (e.g., personal interests, background beliefs, perceptual idiosyncrasies, social identities), acceptance of the proposition remains stable across that variation.  \n\nThe definition is intentionally schematic. \u201cExtraneous\u201d means variation that, on present knowledge, does not affect the pertinent causal or logical relations in the domain studied. The clause \u201ccompetent and sincere\u201d blocks the irrelevance of differences in expertise or honesty. Stability of acceptance can be instantiated in various modalities: direct convergence of observations, reproducible instrument readings, independent derivations that coincide, or a community\u2010vetted equilibrium of views after critical discussion.  \n\nFunctional Role  \n\nDisplaying RIV is what justifies the speech act of objectivity attribution. If a result satisfies RIV, then any epistemic agent has reason to judge that who, exactly, produced the result is a causally irrelevant factor. Consequently, trusting the result does not expose one to the risk of personal bias or sectarian interest.  \n\nConversely, if the RIV condition does not obtain\u2014say the data emerge only when analysed with software whose parameters are tuned to the experimenter\u2019s expectations\u2014calling the result objective would be a misuse of the term, and exhortations to trust it would be epistemically irresponsible.\n\n5. Mapping the Varieties of Objectivity onto RIV  \n\nMy claim is that the traditional sub\u2010types of objectivity can be understood as institutional or methodological design principles for attaining specific dimensions of RIV. Let me illustrate with three of the most discussed kinds.\n\n5.1 Procedural Objectivity  \n\nThe nineteenth\u2010century push for mechanical objectivity, epitomised by the use of self\u2010registering instruments and photographic plates, was motivated by the worry that observer judgment was too easily swayed by theoretical preconception. Standardised procedures\u2014measurement protocols, data pipelines\u2014were devised so that any well\u2010trained practitioner would execute the same steps and hence obtain the same numbers. These procedures secure RIV with respect to idiosyncratic perceptual and cognitive biases.  \n\nNote that merely following procedures is not sufficient for objectivity; the procedures must in fact make acceptance insensitive to irrelevant variation. If the protocol itself embeds a systematic bias (e.g., early blood\u2010pressure cuffs designed for the male arm), then procedural uniformity does not deliver objectivity\u2014precisely because variation in the subject\u2019s anatomy is not \u201cirrelevant.\u201d Thus procedural objectivity is best viewed as one realisation of the general RIV aim, not a standalone ideal.\n\n5.2 Convergent or Aperspectival Objectivity  \n\nBarbara Daston\u2019s aperspectival objectivity and Reichenbach\u2019s notion of convergence both refer to the observed fact that independently collected data sets, processed or interpreted in diverse ways, nevertheless tell the same quantitative story. Examples include the multiple astronomical determinations of the solar constant or the painstaking cross\u2010checks of the Planck satellite against WMAP measurements. Convergence secures RIV across methodological and instrumental variation. When multiple paths, each vulnerable to different possible errors, reach the same endpoint, the probability that the endpoint is an artefact of any one path is drastically reduced.  \n\nNote again that convergence is valuable precisely because it delivers a form of person\u2010 and method\u2010independence. In the recognisable language of robustness analysis (Wimsatt 1981), the power of convergence is obtained when variant investigative routes retain only causal relevance to the phenomenon, eliminating irrelevant causal pathways.\n\n5.3 Interactive Objectivity  \n\nHelen Longino (1990) and Douglas, drawing on feminist epistemology, emphasise the social dimension of objectivity. They argue that in areas where background assumptions and value judgments are unavoidable, objectivity is achieved not by excising human agency but by structuring critical dialogue so that the partiality of any one perspective is counterbalanced by others. Interactive objectivity thus targets sociocultural forms of irrelevant variation\u2014ideology, gender, racial identity\u2014by institutionalising uptake of criticism across social locations (peer review, public data archiving, adversarial collaborations, stakeholder engagement).  \n\nLongino\u2019s four norms\u2014public venue, uptake of criticism, shared standards, tempered equality of intellectual authority\u2014are intelligible as mechanisms for approximating RIV. They aim to ensure that even if initial judgments are perspectival, the final consensus is not hostage to any parochial standpoint.\n\n6. Why Trust Tracks RIV  \n\nGiven the foregoing, we can finally refine the Fine\u2013Douglas intuition: scientists use objectivity language to indicate that the conditions for well\u2010grounded trust (namely RIV) have been, or purport to have been, met. In slogan form:\n\nObjectivity is the warrant, trust is the attitude.  \n\nBy decoupling warrant from attitude, we make sense of three otherwise puzzling facts.\n\n1. One can rationally distrust a purportedly objective result if one has evidence that the RIV condition fails in that instance (think of the initially published but later retracted EPRLS gravitational wave detection in 2015, which was \u201cobjective\u201d by the collaboration\u2019s protocols but not robust once further checks were applied).  \n\n2. One can, at least in principle, trust a result that is not objective\u2014for instance, taking a friend\u2019s word about what is in the next room. Here trust is personal rather than epistemically public.  \n\n3. The explicative order runs from objectivity to trust, not vice versa: we first perform or inspect the methodological work necessary for RIV; only then do we rationally adopt the attitude of trust.  \n\n7. Objections and Replies  \n\nObjection 1: Some objectivity concepts, such as ontological objectivity (\u201cmind\u2010independent existence\u201d), do not fit the RIV model because they are metaphysical, not epistemic.  \n\nReply: It is true that Searle\u2019s use of \u201cobjective\u201d (as a synonym for observer\u2010independent facts) diverges from the epistemic family I have discussed. But the metaphysical use did not motivate the Fine\u2013Douglas trust claim in the first place; nobody says electrons are \u201cobjective\u201d to signal that we can trust them. The target of unification is the cluster of epistemic or methodological senses circulating in science; these are the ones plausibly linked to trust and nicely captured by RIV.\n\nObjection 2: The RIV condition is too strong; science often relies on expert\u2010specific tacit knowledge (Polanyi) which by definition is not reproducible across all inquirers.  \n\nReply: RIV does not demand that anyone, anywhere can replicate results de novo. It requires that, if we vary observers only in respects extraneous to the truth of the claim, the acceptance remains stable. Expertise is not extraneous; indeed, it is a relevant factor. What matters is that the community has worked out procedures for transmitting the requisite tacit knowledge in a manner that renders the results inspectable, at least in principle, by other experts. Laboratory notebook standards and video protocols in molecular biology are meant precisely to satisfy this weaker but still meaningful sense of invariance.\n\nObjection 3: The analysis seems circular: to specify irrelevant variation we already need some grasp of what factors are truth\u2010relevant, which presupposes prior knowledge.  \n\nReply: The worry generalises to all accounts of method; one cannot operationalise good practice without background knowledge of what errors threaten a domain. My account therefore is best interpreted as providing a regulative ideal. RIV states what it is for a claim to be fully objective; fallible agents approximate it using the best available knowledge, revising judgments of relevance in light of new evidence. The ideal guides improvement, much as the account of justification as \u201cbeing supported by the total evidence\u201d guides inquiry despite our never having literally total evidence.\n\n8. Comparative Advantages of the RIV\u2010Based Unification  \n\ni. Explains Diversity: Because different domains confront different potential sources of irrelevant variation, no single procedure suffices; hence the genuine plurality of objectivity modes.  \n\nii. Normatively Actionable: RIV translates into a concrete diagnostic question\u2014\u201cHave we made the outcome insensitive to this or that irrelevant factor?\u201d\u2014which can be answered by designing specific experiments, social arrangements, or analytical cross\u2010checks.  \n\niii. Connects to Social Epistemology: The account dovetails with recent work that models the reliability of scientific networks (e.g., Zollman, Weatherall). Robustness under variation is closely aligned with the value of cognitive diversity shown in these formal models.  \n\niv. Bridges Public Discourse: In science communication, appeals to objectivity succeed only when accompanied by transparent evidence of RIV (open data, preregistration, multi\u2010site replication). Thus the account provides practical guidance for cultivating public trust.\n\n9. Extensions and Limitations  \n\nTwo final caveats are in order. First, RIV is silent on moral or political legitimacy. A claim may be epistemically objective yet morally harmful, in which case public trust may be prudent but still ethically problematic. Second, RIV does not, by itself, guarantee truth; error\u2010complexes can be remarkably robust. Still, a method that survives ever more stringent irrelevant variation tests usually increases the likelihood of truth. Hence objectivity, so understood, is epistemically significant even if fallible.\n\n10. Conclusion  \n\nThe phenomenology of scientific practice supports the idea that objectivity and trust are linked, but it is misleading to identify them. Scientific objectivity is best understood as robustness under irrelevant variation\u2014a property of claims, instruments, or practices that renders their acceptance insensitive to the personal, perspectival, or procedural quirks of investigators. The various named kinds of objectivity in the philosophy of science are concrete strategies for realising different dimensions of this robustness. Trust is the warranted attitude that audiences, whether expert or lay, may adopt once they have good reason to believe that RIV has been achieved.  \n\nThus trust is neither the essence nor the definition of objectivity; it is what objectivity justifies. Recognising this relation clarifies both how the sciences earn their distinctive epistemic authority and why that authority is legitimately contested whenever robustness breaks down. The account retains the functional unity of objectivity while accommodating its historical and methodological plurality\u2014offering, I submit, a more precise and philosophically satisfying answer than the bare slogan \u201cobjectivity means trust.\u201d", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 11, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 3635, "reasoning_tokens": 320}

However, this characterization seems imprecise. What is the actual relationship between scientific objectivity and trust, and can we provide a more precise account of what unifies the different senses of objectivity?", "answer": "1. Introduction: the puzzle about objectivity and trust  \n\nPhilosophers of science increasingly emphasize the multiplicity of things we call \u201cobjective.\u201d Experimental protocols are said to be objective when measurements are produced by calibrated instruments without human judgment (procedural or mechanical objectivity). A conclusion is called objective when results from independent laboratories converge on it (convergent objectivity). Critical exchanges in peer review or interdisciplinary teams are said to afford interactive objectivity. Arthur Fine, Heather Douglas and others have therefore suggested that what unites these scattered uses is simply that they guide \u201ctrust\u201d\u2014to call something objective is, in effect, to certify it as trustworthy.  \n\nThe suggestion is attractive. Objectivity is neither mere truth nor mere impartiality; it is a social\u2010epistemic marker that signals a license to rely on a claim, a dataset, or a procedure. Yet the slogan \u201cobjectivity = trustworthiness\u201d is too coarse. Trust may attach to parents, institutions, computer code, or even lucky charms; clearly not everything we trust is objective. Conversely, scientists often place justified trust in models that they nonetheless call \u201csubjective\u201d or \u201cspeculative.\u201d The concept of trust is also relational (A trusts B to do C), affective (involving vulnerability), and context\u2010sensitive (varying with stakes), whereas objectivity is normally presented as an impersonal epistemic virtue.  \n\nMy aim is to clarify their relationship and to propose a sharper unifying account of scientific objectivity. I will argue that:  \n\n1. Objectivity is best understood as the possession of specific structural properties\u2014call them conditions of public warrant\u2014that render a claim or procedure epistemically trustworthy for any relevantly competent inquirer.  \n2. Trust, therefore, is not itself the essence of objectivity; rather, objectivity comprises the grounds that make a certain attitude of trust rationally permissible.  \n3. The various species of objectivity emphasised in the literature instantiate the same underlying nexus of public\u2010warrant conditions, but they secure those conditions in different ways (through instruments, intersubjective convergence, critical interaction, etc.).  \n\nIf this is correct, we can speak of a unified concept of scientific objectivity without denying its plural forms: they are species of one genus, distinguished by the mechanisms through which they generate public warrant.\n\n2. Mapping the terrain: procedural, convergent, and interactive objectivity  \n\nThe twentieth\u2010century debate on objectivity traces back to concerns about \u201ctyranny of the subject.\u201d Passions, biases, and idiosyncrasies were thought to infect observation; objective science had to purge them. Modern historians of science, beginning with Daston and Galison, have documented a succession of ideals. We need only the minimal sketches here.\n\na. Procedural (or mechanical) objectivity: achieved when observers follow standardized protocols, calibrated instruments, and blind analyses, thereby eliminating personal judgment.  \nb. Convergent objectivity: a claim gains objectivity when it is independently derived through multiple lines of evidence or by different research groups and still \u201ccomes out the same.\u201d  \nc. Interactive (or critical) objectivity: expounded by Helen Longino and developed by Douglas and others. A hypothesis is objective when it survives sustained critical interaction in a suitably structured community\u2014one in which diverse perspectives, transparency of reasoning, and responsiveness to criticism are institutionally secured.\n\nMore refined taxonomies include Hacking\u2019s statistical objectivity, Shapin\u2019s \u201cmoral order,\u201d and Reiss\u2019s \u201ceconomy of models,\u201d but the three forms above are widely cited and will suffice.\n\n3. Fine\u2019s and Douglas\u2019s trust proposals  \n\nArthur Fine (The Shaky Game, 1986) suggests that objectivity is \u201ca badge of trust; it marks those results we feel safe in relying upon.\u201d He intends the point sociologically: invoking objectivity functions as a speech\u2010act that bids the audience to treat a claim as settled. Heather Douglas (Science, Policy, and the Value\u2010Free Ideal, 2009) agrees, but emphasises the normative dimension: calling evidence objective tells policy makers they may place public weight on it.\n\nBoth authors are reacting to the proliferation of competing senses of objectivity. If \u201cobjective\u201d is merely disambiguated into a dozen unrelated meanings, the notion threatens to dissolve. They therefore supply \u201ctrust\u201d as the lowest common denominator.\n\n4. Why \u201ctrust\u201d alone will not do  \n\nThe trust proposal is imprecise in at least four respects.\n\ni. Ambiguity of the attitude: Trust may be affective confidence, mere predictive reliance, or normatively loaded expectation of responsibility. Which sense is relevant?  \n\nii. Relational structure: Trust involves three places (truster, trustee, and task). Objectivity is usually taken to be a monadic property of claims or methods.  \n\niii. Context\u2010sensitivity: How much evidence is needed to trust a climate model used to set carbon taxes differs from what is needed to trust it for educational illustration. Objectivity seems less elastic.  \n\niv. Asymmetry of direction: We can rationally trust something because it is objective, but it need not be objective because we trust it. The arrow of explanation goes from objectivity to justified trust, not the reverse.\n\nHence we must seek a more precise mediator between objectivity and trust.\n\n5. Public warrant as the unifying core  \n\nI propose that objectivity is best analysed in terms of a cluster of properties that jointly provide public warrant. By \u201cpublic warrant\u201d I mean epistemic warrant available in principle to any competent inquirer, irrespective of her personal location, values, or identity. Three conditions jointly constitute public warrant:\n\nPW1. Transparency: The steps from evidence to conclusion are recorded in a form that can be inspected and, if necessary, reconstructed by others.  \nPW2. Reproducibility (broadly construed): Others can, in principle, obtain the same evidential relation (data, observations, derivations) given appropriate competence and resources.  \nPW3. Answerability: Authors or procedures remain open to criticism and can, in principle, be shown to fail if they do not track relevant reasons.\n\nThese conditions express an ideal of impersonal reason\u2010giving. If a claim or method satisfies PW1\u2013PW3 to a sufficiently high degree, then any epistemic agent appropriately situated is entitled to rely on\u2014i.e., to trust\u2014it without further ad hominem investigation. The trust is rationally licensed by the objectivity\u2010conferring properties.\n\nCrucially, the degree, not merely presence, of these conditions matters. This renders objectivity a scalar, context\u2010dependent notion. For low\u2010stakes contexts, moderate levels of transparency and reproducibility suffice; for life\u2010and\u2010death engineering, stringent levels are demanded. This explains the observed gradability of \u201cobjective.\u201d\n\n6. How the familiar varieties of objectivity realise public warrant  \n\nWith this framework, we can see why the diverse senses of objectivity count as genuine species of the same genus.\n\na. Procedural objectivity  \nStandardized protocols and instruments remove dependence on idiosyncratic judgment; they therefore satisfy PW2 (reproducibility) by ensuring anyone can repeat the procedure and obtain comparable measures. Calibration reports and method sections provide PW1 (transparency). By designing error\u2010triggering controls (automation, blind analysis), the community secures PW3: if the procedure malfunctions, anomalies will appear. Thus procedural objectivity realises public warrant primarily by institutionalised removal of subject\u2010specific discretion.\n\nb. Convergent objectivity  \nMultiple independent lines of evidence or competing laboratories mitigate the chance that a shared defect persists. Replication across different inferential routes expands PW3 (answerability) by generating opportunities for failure detection. The public posting of protocols and results addresses PW1, and the independent ability to run alternative tests satisfies PW2. Therefore convergent objectivity realises public warrant through epistemic independence and multiplicity.\n\nc. Interactive objectivity  \nLongino stresses \u201ctempered equality of intellectual authority\u201d and responsiveness to criticism. Here PW3 is foregrounded: communal criticism ensures that hypotheses are accountable to reasons that anyone can raise. PW1 is met by norms of disclosure (methods, data), while PW2 is approximated because other labs or groups can (re)run experiments. Interactive objectivity thus realises public warrant by structuring a social environment in which reasons are publicly vetted.\n\nHence the three forms differ mainly in which mechanism most effectively secures the trio of public\u2010warrant conditions given the task, resources, and epistemic risks.\n\n7. Distinguishing objectivity from mere reliability or accuracy  \n\nWhy not say that objectivity is simply reliability? First, a reliable thermometer kept secret by a company may generate correct readings, but the rest of us lack public warrant for them; the data\u2019s trustworthiness remains opaque. Second, reliability is backward\u2010looking: it tracks actual success rates. Objectivity is also forward\u2010looking: it affords assurance that future uses will remain trustworthy. Our account captures this because PW2\u2013PW3 emphasise potential scrutiny and defeasibility.\n\n8. The role of values and the Douglas critique  \n\nHeather Douglas famously argues that non\u2010epistemic values legitimately influence inductive risk where evidence is uncertain and the social consequences are grave. Doesn\u2019t this undermine public warrant? Not if values themselves are made transparent and answerable. Suppose toxicologists choose a conservative threshold for carcinogenicity because false negatives would be more harmful than false positives. If this weighing is explicit (PW1) and its implications testable (PW2, PW3), then the resulting guideline can still be objective\u2014indeed perhaps more so\u2014because its value\u2010laden steps are publicly inspectable and contestable. On the present account, objectivity does not demand value\u2010freedom; it demands value disclosure and critical answerability.\n\n9. Epistemic trustworthiness, not personal trust  \n\nWe can now explain the Fine\u2010Douglas insight more precisely. To call a claim \u201cobjective\u201d is to assert that it possesses sufficient public\u2010warrant properties to ground epistemic trustworthiness. Trust, in the sense relevant here, is not the affect\u2010laden interpersonal attitude but the rational entitlement to rely on something in one\u2019s deliberations. Public warrant is what converts mere de facto reliance into justified reliance.\n\nImportantly, objectivity is largely monadic: a claim either has or lacks (to some degree) the structural properties. Trust remains relational: agents deliberate about whether to rely. The relation between them is analogous to that between safety features of a bridge and the confidence of drivers. The features (structural integrity, redundancy, inspections) ground but do not equal the confidence.\n\n10. Objections and replies  \n\nObjection 1: Public warrant collapses into social consensus; whatever a community takes as publicly warranted will count as objective, so the account is circular.  \nReply: Consensus is neither necessary nor sufficient. A maverick may recognise that a widely accepted result actually fails PW1 (the data are proprietary). Conversely, consensus may be absent even when PW1\u2013PW3 are satisfied (e.g., in cutting\u2010edge physics). The account evaluates structural features, not mere opinion.\n\nObjection 2: Some domains (e.g., astrophysics) lack direct reproducibility, seemingly flouting PW2.  \nReply: Reproducibility must be understood counterfactually and broadly. We cannot reproduce a supernova, but we can reproduce the evidential relation via independent instruments, wavelength bands, simulations. If no such routes exist, the claim\u2019s objectivity is correspondingly lower; astronomers compensate by elevating PW1 (detailed data release) and PW3 (critical scrutiny).\n\nObjection 3: Quantum randomness implies indeterminacy; no amount of public warrant secures determinate outcomes.  \nReply: Objectivity is not metaphysical determinism; it is about warrant for claims given the phenomena\u2019s inherent stochasticity. Statistical methods can satisfy PW1\u2013PW3 precisely by quantifying uncertainty.\n\n11. Advantages of the unified account  \n\n1. Integration: It unites mechanical, convergent, and interactive objectivity under one structural concept.  \n2. Gradability: It naturally yields degrees of objectivity relative to context, explaining everyday scientific talk of \u201cmore\u201d or \u201cless\u201d objective.  \n3. Normativity: It clarifies why objectivity is a goal: it affords justified reliance by any stakeholder, crucial for science\u2019s public authority.  \n4. Compatibility with plurality: Different sciences may instantiate the warrant conditions differently\u2014e.g., double\u2010blind trials in medicine, paleontological consilience, or open\u2010source code in computational biology\u2014without fragmenting the concept.\n\n12. Conclusion  \n\nThe rhetoric equating objectivity with trust captures an important sociological fact: scientists and lay audiences use the term \u201cobjective\u201d as a signal that something can be relied upon. But trust itself is an attitude, not a property. What unifies the diverse senses of scientific objectivity are the structural conditions that make such reliance rationally licit\u2014conditions I have labelled transparency, reproducibility, and answerability, together forming public warrant. Procedural, convergent, and interactive ideals differ chiefly in how they secure these conditions under different epistemic and practical constraints. Thus, scientific objectivity is best characterised not by the psychological state of trust but by the publicly inspectable grounds that make warranted trust possible.

{"question_id": "Koskinen-DefendingRiskAccount-2020", "question": "Several philosophers of science, including Arthur Fine and Heather Douglas, have suggested that the various applicable senses of scientific objectivity (such as procedural objectivity, convergent objectivity, and interactive objectivity) share a common basis in trust\u2014that when we call something objective, we indicate that it can be trusted. However, this characterization seems imprecise. What is the actual relationship between scientific objectivity and trust, and can we provide a more precise account of what unifies the different senses of objectivity?", "answer": "Scientific objectivity, like most of the heavyweight concepts in the philosophy of science, has multiplied rather than diminished under analysis.  Instead of a single crystal-clear property, we now speak of procedural objectivity, mechanical objectivity, aperspectival objectivity, interactive objectivity, convergent objectivity, and so on.  Arthur Fine\u2019s slogan that \u201cobjective = trustworthy\u201d and Heather Douglas\u2019s more programmatic claim that \u201cobjectivity is what makes science trustworthy\u201d capture an important insight: all of these modes of objectivity play some role in making it reasonable for us\u2014both scientists and lay citizens\u2014to depend on scientific results.  But \u201cobjectivity = trustworthiness\u201d is, by itself, too coarse.  First, trust is a relation between persons or agents, whereas objectivity is typically said of methods, data sets, or claims.  Second, philosophers of trust have shown that trust is not mere reliance; it also involves vulnerability and normative expectations.  Finally, even if objectivity typically licenses trust, not every ground of rational trust is a form of objectivity (consider trusting someone on the basis of their moral character).  \n\nIn what follows I argue for three theses.\n\n1.  The different senses of scientific objectivity can be mapped onto different kinds of error-management mechanisms.  \n2.  What unifies them is the same meta-property: resilient, public, and defeasible error-detection and error-correction.  I call this meta-property \u201cscrutiny-resilience.\u201d  \n3.  Scrutiny-resilience explains why objectivity justifies a distinctive pattern of epistemic trust\u2014rationally grounded dependence under conditions of vulnerability.  Thus trust is the upshot of objectivity rather than its definition.\n\nThe argument proceeds in four steps.  I begin by clarifying the notion of trust.  I then analyse three canonical senses of objectivity\u2014procedural, convergent, and interactive\u2014in terms of their respective error-management strategies.  Third, I extract the common denominator across these strategies.  Finally, I show how the resulting account puts the relation between objectivity and trust on a more precise footing.\n\n1.  What exactly is trust?\n\nLike knowledge, trust is a success term.  If A trusts B to \u03d5, A not only relies on B to \u03d5 but also understands herself to be vulnerable to B\u2019s failure and to be entitled to feel betrayed if B fails through negligence or ill will.  Philosophers such as Annette Baier, Diego Gambetta, Karen Jones, and Katherine Hawley converge on three conditions:\n\na.  Dependence:  A\u2019s aims are contingent on B\u2019s performance.  \nb.  Vulnerability:  A cannot fully monitor or control B\u2019s behaviour.  \nc.  Normative expectation:  A assumes that B is competent and sincere with respect to \u03d5, and B recognises that A so assumes.\n\nConsequently trust is not the same as prediction or simple reliance; it is reliance under acknowledged vulnerability buttressed by an expectation of competence and good will.  In the epistemic domain we trust when we form beliefs by depending on other agents\u2014experts, instruments, institutions\u2014accepting our vulnerability to their possible error or deception.\n\nObjectivity enters this picture because it offers a set of reasons to believe that the trusted party is reliable and accountable.  As Douglas emphasises, objectivity \u201cearns\u201d trust; it does not constitute it.\n\n2.  Three kinds of objectivity as three kinds of error management\n\nScientific practice is shot through with ways of detecting and correcting error.  Each sense of objectivity identifies a distinctive locus or level at which errors can creep in and prescribes institutional or methodological safeguards.  \n\n2.1  Procedural (or mechanical) objectivity\n\nOriginating in nineteenth-century ideals of self-registering apparatuses and later laboratory protocols, procedural objectivity seeks to suppress idiosyncratic judgment by substituting algorithms, calibrated instruments, or constrained manipulation.  Examples range from standard operating procedures in clinical trials to blind analysis in particle physics.  The epistemic rationale is minimisation of \u201coperator bias\u201d and idiosyncratic judgment.\n\nError management:  eliminate or at least neutralise person-specific sources of error by embedding them in repeatable procedures.\n\n2.2  Convergent objectivity\n\nConvergent objectivity, articulated by Ian Hacking and Naomi Oreskes, turns on the robust agreement of independent lines of evidence.  When different instruments, techniques, or theoretical derivations converge, the probability that the result is an artefact of any particular instrument, technique, or background assumption plummets.  Think of confirming the structure of the DNA double helix by X-ray crystallography, model building, and chemical analysis.\n\nError management:  reduce the likelihood of systematic error through evidential independence and overdetermination.\n\n2.3  Interactive (or social) objectivity\n\nHelen Longino\u2019s interactive objectivity locates the resource of objectivity not in individual minds or procedures but in the critical interaction of a diverse scientific community.  Objectivity here is secured by recognising and subjecting the background assumptions of research to critical scrutiny from multiple social standpoints.  Peer review, replication by rival labs, and conferences all instantiate this sense.\n\nError management:  identify and correct background-assumption and confirmation-bias errors through critical dialogue across heterogeneous perspectives.\n\n3.  The unifying meta-property: scrutiny-resilience\n\nComparing the three types of objectivity, we see different mechanisms but a common ambition: making results resilient to scrutiny by competent others.  In each case what matters is not that personal judgment disappears (as if that were possible) but that any remaining judgmental leeway is exposed, traceable, and open to challenge.  This resilience has three hallmarks.\n\n3.1  Publicity\n\nThe procedures, datasets, or argumentative moves must be public, at least in principle.  If the steps are opaque, third-party scrutiny cannot get off the ground.\n\n3.2  Defeasibility\n\nA scrutiny-resilient result is always open to being overturned by better evidence or arguments.  There are no appeals to authority that are beyond question.\n\n3.3  Redundancy of pathways\n\nThere should be more than one route by which mistakes can be spotted.  Blind analysis and peer review may catch different bugs; independent replication may catch both.\n\nScrutiny-resilience yields a precise and operationalisable desideratum: the more publicly accessible, defeasible, and multiply checkable the path from data to claim, the more objective the claim in virtue of its capacity to resist potential error.  Objectivity so understood is relative to the best scrutiny presently available but is nonetheless gradable and practically actionable.\n\nWe can now state the relationship between the specific sub-types and the meta-property.\n\n\u2022  Procedural objectivity contributes to scrutiny-resilience by stabilising the \u201cfront end\u201d of inquiry; it renders the production of data sufficiently uniform that later critics can compare like with like.\n\n\u2022  Convergent objectivity contributes by providing \u201cside checks.\u201d  Because each line of evidence can function as a control on the others, critics need not take any single methodology on trust.\n\n\u2022  Interactive objectivity supplies the \u201cback end\u201d check: social criticism identifies hidden assumptions even when every procedure and datum is accurately reported.\n\n4.  Why scrutiny-resilience grounds rational trust\n\nReturn to the structure of trust.  Epistemic agents (citizens, policymakers, other scientists) must often depend on scientific results while lacking the expertise or resources to replicate the work themselves.  They are vulnerable.  The normative presupposition they adopt is that the scientific community is both competent and sincere.  Scrutiny-resilience underwrites those presuppositions in two ways.\n\nFirst, competence.  If a community has built-in mechanisms for detecting and correcting error, the probability that it will eventually weed out incompetence is high.  Scrutiny-resilience functions as an incentive structure that favours accurate, well-supported claims.  Even if individual scientists slip, the system is self-correcting.\n\nSecond, sincerity.  Public, defeasible, multi-path scrutiny makes deception risky and costly.  Fraudsters are more likely to be caught and disgraced; hence the community expectation of honesty becomes more credible.\n\nIn fine, objectivity\u2019s relation to trust is not definitional but justificatory.  Objectivity does not equal trust; rather, objectivity\u2014understood as scrutiny-resilience\u2014provides the conditions under which trust is rational, stable, and institutionally supported.\n\n5.  Comparison with alternative views\n\nThe proposed account improves on simple \u201cobjectivity = trustworthiness\u201d slogans because it explains:\n\na.  Why some trustworthy practices (e.g., personal witnessing by a saintly but non-replicable observer) need not be objective; they lack publicity, defeasibility, and redundant error checks.\n\nb.  How objectivity can come in degrees.  A study that is procedural and convergent but not socially interactive (perhaps because dissenting voices are excluded) is less scrutiny-resilient than one that is strong on all three fronts.\n\nc.  Why social values, far from contaminating objectivity, are required for it.  Valuational diversity fuels the critical interaction essential to interactive objectivity; funding incentives can encourage replication; legal norms mandate openness.  Thus the old ideal of value-free objectivity is replaced by a richer account in which values structure, but do not dictate, the content of claims.\n\n6.  Objections and replies\n\nObjection 1:  Scrutiny-resilience is too broad: engineering standards, journalistic fact-checking, or legal cross-examination also fit.  Does that collapse objectivity into a generic property of any disciplined practice?\n\nReply:  There is no reason to think objectivity is unique to science.  The account predicts that where similar scrutiny-resilience structures exist, similar levels of warranted trust should follow.  The point is explanatory, not exclusivist.\n\nObjection 2:  Scrutiny-resilience elides the metaphysical dimension of objectivity: the claim that science accurately describes mind-independent reality.\n\nReply:  Metaphysical realism is compatible with the present account but is conceptually separable.  The question at stake is not whether successful science is true of the external world but how, in practice, scientists and the public can justifiably treat some results as dependable\u2014even before ultimate metaphysical confirmation.\n\nObjection 3:  Publicity and redundancy presuppose rather than create trust.  One must already trust the community to have honestly reported their methods and data.\n\nReply:  Initial trust is indeed necessary to get the system running, but that trust is minimal and inexpensive\u2014akin to the trust one places in a stranger merely by holding out a hand to shake.  The point is not to eliminate all trust but to build structures that amplify scant initial trust into robust warranted trust by making deceit and incompetence detectable.\n\n7.  Practical corollaries\n\n7.1  Policy relevance\n\nWhen policymakers demand \u201cobjective science,\u201d what they should be asking for are processes demonstrably high in scrutiny-resilience: publicly archived data, independent replication, conflict-of-interest disclosures, and pluralistic advisory bodies.\n\n7.2  Science communication\n\nTrust in science falters when the public cannot see the scrutiny-resilience architecture.  Communicators should therefore emphasise error-detection mechanisms rather than solely the authority of credentials or the romantic picture of lone geniuses.\n\n7.3  Responsible research and innovation\n\nScrutiny-resilience dovetails with calls for transparency, open data, registered reports, and citizen science.  Each widens the circle of potentially critical eyes and thereby strengthens objectivity.\n\n8.  Conclusion\n\nThe multiplicity of \u201cobjectivities\u201d in contemporary philosophy of science is not mere terminological clutter.  Each variant targets a distinct vector of possible error.  Yet they are not disparate; they cohere around a single meta-property\u2014scrutiny-resilience: public, defeasible, multi-path structures for detecting and correcting error.  This unified account clarifies the relation between objectivity and trust.  Calling a scientific claim \u201cobjective\u201d is shorthand for saying, in effect, \u201cyou can depend on this; the claim has been, and remains, open to stringent scrutiny whose mechanisms are such that error, bias, and deceit are likely to be uncovered.\u201d  Trust, then, is not what objectivity is; it is what objectivity, properly understood, reliably earns.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 13, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 3041, "reasoning_tokens": 384}

However, this characterization seems imprecise. What is the actual relationship between scientific objectivity and trust, and can we provide a more precise account of what unifies the different senses of objectivity?", "answer": "1. Introduction: the puzzle of unity  \n\nPhilosophers and historians of science have multiplied the adjectives of objectivity. Daston and Galison (2007) alone distinguish mechanical, structural, aperspectival and interactive objectivity; feminist epistemologists add standpoint objectivity; philosophers of measurement talk about procedural and operational objectivity; statisticians praise \u201cobjective Bayes.\u201d A natural suspicion arises that the term has become an honorific with no stable core. Arthur Fine\u2019s quip that \u201cobjective just means trustworthy\u201d and Heather Douglas\u2019s suggestion that objectivity is the \u201cgrounds for warranted trust\u201d promise a unifying key: perhaps to call a result objective is simply to say that it is worthy of trust. But critics complain that this is too thin\u2014surely we can trust a seasoned pilot or an old friend without calling them objective. Conversely, a double-blind randomized trial may be objective even when no one in the public actually trusts it. The task, then, is twofold: (1) articulate the precise relation between objectivity and trust, and (2) explain what, if anything, unifies the many senses of \u201cscientific objectivity.\u201d  \n\nI shall argue for the following thesis.  \n\nThesis: The various senses of scientific objectivity are unified by a single underlying epistemic property\u2014call it intersubjective justificatory robustness (IJR). A method, datum, model or claim is objectively warranted when it is produced by processes that make its epistemic merits resilient across relevant perspectives, competences and contexts of critical scrutiny. Scientific communities rightly invite trust in outputs that satisfy IJR, because such outputs give any suitably situated inquirer adequate reason to expect their reliability. Thus the proper relation is: (a) objectivity = IJR; (b) trust = a rational attitude adopted toward outputs exhibiting IJR.  \n\nOn this view \u201cobjectivity\u201d names a cluster of practices, each aimed at insulating inferences from localized cognitive or social idiosyncrasies. The practices differ (procedural, convergent, interactive \u2026), but they count as objectivity-conducive insofar as they advance justificatory robustness. Trust is not the essence of objectivity; rather, objectivity is what epistemically licenses trust. Trust can therefore serve as a sociological marker of objectivity, while IJR supplies the concept\u2019s logical unity.\n\n2. Clarifying \u201ctrust\u201d  \n\nWe must be clear about what kind of trust is at issue. Philosophers distinguish:  \n\na. Predictive reliance: I bet that the elevator cable will hold.  \nb. Epistemic trust: I accept another\u2019s testimony as evidence.  \nc. Normative trust (second-personal): I rely on someone because I take them to undertake a responsibility to me.  \n\nWhen Douglas says that objectivity underwrites trust, she is not talking about normative commitment but about epistemic reliance: scientists and publics can use an \u201cobjective\u201d result as a secure premise in further reasoning or practical deliberation. Let us therefore stipulate:\n\nEpistemic trustworthiness = the property of being a source of belief such that rational agents, given their aims, background knowledge and constraints, ought to rely on it.\n\nTo explain objectivity we must explain what makes a process or output epistemically trustworthy in this sense. \u201cBecause it is objective\u201d is no explanation; we need a non-circular criterion.\n\n3. Intersubjective justificatory robustness (IJR)  \n\nConsider three familiar objectivity norms:\n\n\u2022 Procedural objectivity (PO): eliminate idiosyncratic judgement by rigid, public, mechanical procedures (e.g., standard protocols, double-blinding).  \n\u2022 Convergent objectivity (CO): establish results that independent lines of evidence converge upon (e.g., triangulation, consilience).  \n\u2022 Interactive objectivity (IO): secure conclusions through critical interaction among diverse investigators who challenge one another\u2019s biases.\n\nEach norm aims to secure more than mere accuracy: it aims to produce claims whose justification is resilient under scrutiny by differently situated inquirers. The historian may mistrust a single eyewitness but trust a concordant set of reports from witnesses with distinct interests; the physiologist may mistrust one laboratory\u2019s assay but trust results obtained in multiple labs with distinct instrumentation; the climate modeller may mistrust one model but trust an ensemble whose independent errors cancel. In every case the justificatory force derives from the fact that if one removed or substituted an inquirer with another competent inquirer, the conclusion would still stand. The supporting evidence is \u201cportable\u201d across perspectives.\n\nI call this feature intersubjective justificatory robustness:\n\nIJR: A knowledge-claim possesses IJR to the extent that its justification survives uptake, replication, or critical evaluation by a relevant plurality of competent agents operating under variable, but epistemically favourable, conditions.\n\nIJR is stronger than individual reliability (a lone genius may be reliable yet fragile to social transfer) and weaker than Cartesian certainty (it is defeasible). It is a modal property\u2014about how justification would fare across counterfactual contexts of uptake\u2014hence it suits the explanatory target: objectivity marks beliefs good to share, extend and build upon.\n\n4. How each sense of objectivity secures IJR  \n\n4.1 Procedural objectivity  \n\nMechanical protocols limit the influence of experimenter expectations, perceptual limitations or local conventions. By standardizing sample preparation, measurement units, statistical thresholds, etc., they ensure that another competent agent following the same procedure would obtain the same result, regardless of idiosyncratic motive. Thus PO promotes IJR by making justificatory success independent of who performs the experiment.  \n\n4.2 Convergent objectivity  \n\nCO leverages evidential diversity. When distinct methods, instruments, theoretical frameworks or error structures yield the same estimate, that estimate is robust to the replacement of any one epistemic pathway. The robustness is intersubjective because the different investigators need not share assumptions; if their independent lines converge, the justification survives a wide array of counterfactual challenges.  \n\n4.3 Interactive objectivity  \n\nFeminist, standpoint and critical interlocutors emphasize that even standardized procedures embed background judgements (choice of categories, questions asked, modelling assumptions). The corrective is systematic exposure to rivals who hold different background values, biases or theoretical commitments. Through organised antagonism (peer review, seminar discussion, interdisciplinary collaboration), potential sources of error are surfaced and addressed. The result is again IJR: a claim that withstands diverse critical perspectives stands a better chance of being justified for all.\n\n4.4 Other senses  \n\nAperspectival objectivity (neutral representation, e.g., photographic plates) suppresses individual perspective; structural objectivity (mathematical invariance) abstracts away from coordinate choices; model-based objectivity (error bars, sensitivity analyses) explores parameter spaces. All can be reconstrued as strategies for rendering justification stable under variation of epistemically irrelevant factors.\n\n5. Why IJR licenses epistemic trust  \n\nSuppose a claim C enjoys high IJR. Then:  \n(1) The evidence for C does not depend on any single individual\u2019s testimony or local condition.  \n(2) Competent agents who examine the justificatory record would, with high probability, also accept C.  \n(3) Known ways of defeating C have been explicitly probed and found wanting.\n\nGiven these three features, a rational agent who lacks the time or resources to replicate the entire process can justifiably rely on C for further reasoning. That is to say, she can place epistemic trust in C, just as she trusts (in the predictive-reliance sense) that a bridge engineered under stringent codes will not collapse. The bridge analogy helps: building codes embody various robustness-securing practices (redundancies, safety factors, peer review). We call a design \u201csound\u201d when it survives them; we trust a sound design. The relation is not conceptual equivalence but pragmatic: objectivity invites, and normatively justifies, trust.\n\n6. Objections and replies  \n\nObjection 1: Some social entities (central banks, public health agencies) are trusted despite opaque internal processes; yet we might hesitate to call their pronouncements objective.  \n\nReply: On my account, objectivity is not whatever is trusted; it is what is worthy of trust because of IJR. Publics can misplace trust; that shows that trust is fallible, not that objectivity = trust. The bank\u2019s policy may enjoy public trust without IJR; then the trust is epistemically unjustified.\n\nObjection 2: Certain sciences (e.g., string theory) lack convergent empirical lines yet practitioners call them \u201cobjective\u201d insofar as their mathematical arguments are compelling.  \n\nReply: The relevant plurality of competent agents differs by domain. In mathematics, proof standards\u2014formal derivations checked by independent readers\u2014deliver IJR even in the absence of empirical convergence. String theory\u2019s objectivity is controversial precisely because its justificatory robustness across evidence modalities is limited; the debate is about whether available techniques suffice for IJR.\n\nObjection 3: Robustness is a matter of degree, but objectivity is often treated as binary.  \n\nReply: Scientific practice routinely grades objectivity (e.g., \u201cpreliminary,\u201d \u201ctentative,\u201d \u201cwell-established\u201d). Our semantics blurs the gradient, but policy interfaces (IPCC confidence levels) make the gradation explicit. IJR explains this: robustness can increase with additional replication, triangulation or critique.\n\nObjection 4: Some biases are systemic (e.g., androcentric assumptions) and may evade detection by current critical communities, so IJR is aspirational.  \n\nReply: Agreed. Objectivity is an ideal regulative concept. What matters is the direction of improvement: expanding the plurality of competent agents (including those with marginalized standpoints) enhances robustness. Failures of objectivity are diagnosed when later scrutiny shows earlier justifications were not robust.\n\n7. The social-institutional dimension  \n\nIJR is instantiated only through concrete social practices, norms, and infrastructures: funding structures that support replication, journals enforcing data and code sharing, instruments that record raw traces, statistical software that automates procedures, training regimes that cultivate adversarial review. These institutions embed moral and political values (equity, accountability). Thus objectivity is not value-free; rather, it depends on a value-laden architecture designed to make justification portable. The instrumental point of calling for \u201cobjective science\u201d in public controversies (vaccines, climate) is to appeal to those institutions: \u201ctrust us because we have submitted the claim to practices that anyone\u2014friend or foe\u2014could, in principle, use to check it.\u201d  \n\nUnderstanding objectivity as IJR shows why transparency and openness matter: they widen the circle of potential competent agents who can test justification, thereby increasing robustness and hence the claim\u2019s right to be trusted.\n\n8. Conclusion  \n\nThe elusive core that unites the many species of scientific objectivity is not the sociopsychological attitude of trust itself but the property that warrants such trust: intersubjective justificatory robustness. Procedural, convergent, interactive and other forms of objectivity are tools for achieving this robustness by neutralising different failure modes\u2014individual bias, method-specific error, perspectival limitation. When a claim emerges intact from these diverse techniques, it merits epistemic trust; to call it \u201cobjective\u201d is to signal this warrant. Trust and objectivity are therefore intimately connected, yet conceptually distinct: trust is the rational attitude we ought to adopt toward outputs that satisfy the IJR condition, while objectivity is the satisfaction of that condition.

{"question_id": "Maguire-GameBelief-2020", "question": "Some philosophers argue that there are both epistemic reasons (evidence-based) and practical reasons (concerning usefulness, harm, or moral considerations) that bear on what we ought to believe. However, these two types of reasons seem fundamentally different in kind\u2014epistemic reasons concern truth-conduciveness while practical reasons concern value or welfare. If both types of reasons genuinely bear on belief, how can they possibly interact to determine what one ought to believe, given that they seem incommensurable and thus impossible to weigh against each other directly?", "answer": "Epistemologists and moral philosophers have lately converged on an apparently paradoxical thought. On the one hand, the norm that seems constitutive of belief is epistemic: believe, other things equal, in proportion to your evidence. On the other hand, we are recognisably sensitive to an array of non-epistemic or \u201cpractical\u2019\u2019 considerations when we decide what view to adopt: the patient who chooses to believe she will recover because that very attitude promotes recovery; the friend who withholds belief that her partner betrayed a confidence in order not to wrong him by accepting the accusation too readily; the climate activist who judges that publishing a tentative result will embolden deniers and so postpones belief until the evidence is overwhelming. These cases do not feel like mere akratic lapses. Many agents experience them as moments in which distinct, genuine reasons pull in opposing directions. How\u2014if at all\u2014can those reasons be brought into one deliberative space so that an \u201call-things-considered\u2019\u2019 verdict about what to believe is possible?\n\nI will defend a hybrid, two-level model that aims to reconcile the seeming incommensurability of epistemic and practical reasons without collapsing one into the other. The view has three main commitments.\n\n1. Functional dualism: belief has two functions, a constitutive function of representing the world accurately and a regulative function of facilitating successful agency in that world.\n\n2. Normative pluralism: for each function there is a corresponding kind of reason\u2014truth-related reasons for fulfilling the representational function, and value-related reasons for fulfilling the agential function.\n\n3. Hierarchical aggregation: the two kinds of reason interact through a lexically ordered decision rule. Very roughly, epistemic reasons set a permissibility threshold; practical reasons then operate within the space of epistemically permissible options to determine which belief, if any, is required or forbidden all things considered.\n\nI proceed in four steps. Section I clarifies the alleged incommensurability. Section II surveys three familiar strategies\u2014reduction, pragmatic encroachment and simple weighing\u2014and argues that each fails. Section III lays out the hybrid model and shows how it renders the reasons commensurable at the right level. Section IV treats hard cases, including moral encroachment and doxastic wrongdoing, and explains why the hybrid view delivers intuitive verdicts. I close with some speculative remarks on what the model tells us about the unity of practical and theoretical reason.\n\nI. Why the reasons look incommensurable\n\nStart with two truisms.\n\nT1  Epistemic reasons for belief derive their normative force from a connection to truth or knowledge. Paradigmatic epistemic reasons are evidential: p is strongly supported by your total evidence.\n\nT2  Practical reasons for belief derive their force from the value of having or withholding the belief: believing p may increase well-being, prevent harm, discharge an obligation, honour a friendship, etc.\n\nBecause the right-making property of an epistemic reason is accuracy, whereas the right-making property of a practical reason is utility or morality broadly understood, it can seem that the two must float in distinct normative dimensions. If so, no sensible \u201cweighing\u2019\u2019 is possible: how many microns of evidential probability equal a micromort of expected harm? But if they cannot compete on a shared scale, then they cannot jointly determine what one ought to believe. The upshot would be an uncomfortable disjunctive norm: epistemically you ought to believe p, practically you ought not, and nothing settles the conflict.\n\nTwo further features intensify the worry.\n\nIncorrigibility. The psychological structure of belief is involuntary, or at least semi-involuntary. One cannot usually believe at will; one\u2019s doxastic attitude is fixed by what strikes one as true. If so, practical reasons appear motivationally inert.\n\nConstitutivity. Many hold that aiming at truth is constitutive of belief. If a mental state is guided primarily by pragmatic aims rather than truth, it may not count as belief at all but as make-believe, acceptance, or pretense.\n\nTaken together, these points suggest that practical reasons are alien intruders in the domain of belief. Yet the cases with which I opened remain. We need a story that neither ostracises practical reasons nor trivialises epistemic ones.\n\nII. Unsatisfying escape routes\n\n1. Reduction to the epistemic. One might hold that every genuine reason for belief is epistemic; the so-called practical reasons are merely reasons to act as though one believed. When the athlete forms a \u201cconfidence\u2019\u2019 belief to enhance performance, she in fact suspends belief while employing a motivational technique. This line has force where the attitude really is a pretend-belief, but there exist cases\u2014religious faith, moral trust, therapeutic optimism\u2014where agents themselves are disposed to assert and infer in ways characteristic of full belief, not convenient pretense. A purely reductionist manoeuvre thus lacks descriptive adequacy.\n\n2. Pragmatic encroachment. A popular alternative is to let practical stakes alter the evidence threshold for knowledge or justified belief. On one version, S knows p only if her evidence for p would satisfy a sceptical assessor who grants weight to the importance for S of avoiding error. Higher stakes raise the bar, so practical considerations influence whether the epistemic condition is met. While elegant, the view faces two objections. First, it blurs rather than equips us to reconcile the two kinds of reason: it smuggles practical factors into the epistemic notion itself and hence leaves no distinct practical reasons remaining. Second, encroachment struggles with benign cases where utility presses toward belief despite modest evidence (deliberate placebo beliefs). Here the stakes are not that the cost of error is high but that the benefit of belief is large. Encroachment predicts no upward shift in the knowledge threshold, yet ordinary intuition still finds the belief rationally tempting.\n\n3. Simple balancing. A decision-theoretic model might represent doxastic options (believe p, suspend, believe not-p) as acts with utilities given by a mix of epistemic value (accuracy) and practical value (welfare). Choose the doxastic act that maximises expected total value. The attraction is obvious: we convert reasons into a single currency of value. The trouble is twofold. First, epistemic value is not obviously additive with practical value. At what rate of exchange? Without a principled account, the balancing is mere algebraic hand-waving. Second, simple balancing licenses \u201cwishful\u2019\u2019 beliefs whenever a large enough practical benefit outruns a small epistemic cost. That seems to sanction the epistemic vice of self-deception. The model therefore threatens to undermine the constitutive connection between belief and truth.\n\nWe require an arrangement that allows genuine practical reasons, respects truth-aim, and yet explains how the two combine to yield an overall verdict.\n\nIII. A hybrid, two-level model\n\nHere is the core proposal.\n\nLevel 1: Epistemic permissibility. You are permitted to believe p only if your epistemic reasons meet a threshold fixed by the representational function of belief. A natural gloss is that believing p is epistemically permissible just when p is more likely than not on your total evidence, or in stronger versions when your evidence puts you in a position to know p. This is a domain-specific deontic operator: \u2018may_e\u2019.\n\nLevel 2: Practical requirement/defeat. Among the beliefs that pass the Level 1 filter, practical reasons can require you to take up one, prohibit you from taking any, or leave you free. If a practical reason to believe p is strong enough, then, provided p is epistemically permissible, you ought all things considered to believe p; if a practical reason against believing p is strong enough, you ought to refuse belief even though it is epistemically permissible; if both kinds of practical reason are weak, epistemic permission remains the final word.\n\nLexical ordering. The hierarchy is strict: no practical reason, however weighty, can oblige you to believe p when belief in p is epistemically impermissible. When epistemically impermissible, the option drops out of the choice set over which practical reasons range.\n\nWhy think the hierarchy is defensible? Start with the underlying functions.\n\nF1 Truth-aim. Belief\u2019s constitutive point is to represent reality correctly. If so, forming a belief that outruns one\u2019s evidence constitutes a form of malfunction.\n\nF2 Agency-support. Elucidated by Alonso, Hieronyi and others, belief serves to guide deliberation and co-ordinate action. A belief that is epistemically acceptable may nonetheless hinder or promote agency.\n\nThe two functions are not symmetrical. Representational accuracy is the necessary precondition for the reliable service of agency: acting on false belief tends to frustrate goals. Hence the regulative function is conditional on the constitutive one. We can capture that dependence by lexical priority: first ensure a minimal threshold of correctness; only then consider how the belief will serve broader ends. The hierarchy makes room for practical defeaters without compromising the basic teleology of belief.\n\nWhere the contrary intuition\u2014that practical benefits sometimes excuse epistemic risk\u2014feels irresistible, I suggest we are often dealing with permitted partial beliefs (credences) rather than full belief. Nothing in my model prohibits practical considerations from nudging the degree of confidence within the zone of epistemic indeterminacy. All it rules out is outright belief beyond the permissibility line.\n\nIV. Confronting hard cases\n\n1. The life-saving placebo. A terminally ill patient believes she will recover, though the medical evidence is only 40 percent. Recovery probabilities measurably improve when patients entertain such optimism. On the hybrid view, the epistemic threshold for permissible full belief (say >0.5) is not reached; therefore belief is impermissible, hence excluded from practical selection. The agent ought instead to adopt a high credence or perhaps an imaginative acceptance in therapy sessions. This verdict retains respect for truth-aim while preserving room for practical reasoning\u2014in this case about which attitude short of belief best promotes health.\n\n2. Moral encroachment. According to recent work by Basu, Gardiner and others, morality can affect what you epistemically ought to believe. For example, low-evidence negative stereotypes about a stigmatised group are \u201cepistemically\u2019\u2019 unjustifiable. Without denying the linguistic merits of that claim, the hybrid model offers a reinterpretation: morality supplies an undefeated practical reason not to take up a belief that is only barely epistemically permissible. Because the evidential support typically falls near or below the threshold anyway, abstaining from belief satisfies Level 1 and Level 2 together. The model thus predicts that moral considerations can sway the overall verdict while stopping short of positing a sui generis moral contribution to epistemic justification itself.\n\n3. Doxastic wrongdoing. Suppose I form a nasty belief about you on slim evidence, and you rightly feel wronged. The wrong, on my view, lies not in violating an epistemic duty (I may have met the bare threshold) but in flouting a practical duty of interpersonal respect that bears on belief. Because respect forbids adopting demeaning beliefs absent compelling need, the practical reason defeats the epistemic permission. Again, the model allows that you can wrong someone by what you believe without implying that evidential norms get adjusted by moral status.\n\n4. High-stakes knowledge. You are offered a bet that pays hugely if a particular flight lands on time and ruins you if it is late. You\u2019ve read the statistical tables: 95 percent of flights on that route land on time. Is it epistemically permissible to believe the flight will be punctual? Many feel \u201cno\u2019\u2019 given the stakes. The hybrid view explains this indirectly. Believing the flight will be on time would lead a rational agent straight into the bet. Since accepting the bet is practically forbidden by prudence, believing so as to lead yourself into that action conflicts with your overarching practical reasons. Epistemically the belief might be permissible; practically it is defeated. Note that we can get the intuitive result without building the stakes into epistemic justification itself.\n\nV. Advantages and residual worries\n\n1. Non-arbitrariness. The hybrid model does not rely on ad hoc cardinal weights. Its lexically ordered rule follows from an asymmetry between constitutive and regulative functions of belief.\n\n2. Unity of deliberation. Reasons of both kinds enter into a single deliberative process: you first check epistemic permissibility, then let practical reasons refine the choice. Hence no collapse into disjunctive oughts.\n\n3. Integrity of epistemic norm. Because practical reasons can never license epistemically impermissible belief, there is no path to wholesale wishful thinking.\n\n4. Psychological realism. The model predicts familiar phenomenology. Typically, we feel pressure from evidence first; only after satisfying it do we ask whether believing, suspending or disbelieving serves friendship, prudence or morality.\n\nTwo objections merit response.\n\nO1  Over-stringency. What if the epistemic threshold is set too high? Everyday life functions with quick heuristic beliefs. Reply: the threshold need not be certainty or even knowledge; it is fixed by what level of evidential probability is required for stable utility across normal environments. In low-cost environments a 0.55 probability may suffice; the hierarchy is neutral on where precisely the limit falls.\n\nO2  Non-voluntarism. If belief is involuntary, how can practical reasons operate at Level 2? Answer: even if belief is not fully under direct control, we exercise indirect control via evidence seeking, attention management, and doxastic self-regulation. Practical reasons plausibly bear on those upstream activities. When they speak loudly, we steer ourselves so that the downstream belief either does or does not crystallise.\n\nVI. Broader moral\n\nThe hybrid package offers a modest but significant reconciliation. It recognises that epistemic and practical reasons point to different fundamental values yet insists they come together under a structured decision rule reflecting the layered functional architecture of belief. In that sense the reasons are not so much commensurable in themselves as commensurated by the agency that must respond to them. The model thus exemplifies a more general pattern: heterogeneous reasons can interact because rational agents adopt higher-order principles\u2014lexical hierarchies, thresholds, vetoes\u2014that resolve clashes without demanding a single underlying currency of value.\n\nSeen from that angle, the apparent incommensurability between the epistemic and the practical begins to look less like a metaphysical gulf and more like a symptom of focusing on first-order reasons in isolation from the second-order norms that govern their interaction. Philosophical anxiety fades once we appreciate that rational deliberation is multi-level: the deep unity of reason is achieved not by reducing all reasons to one kind but by integrating them under a hierarchy that mirrors the layered purposes of our mental economies. In the economy of belief, truth remains the non-negotiable ground floor; what we build on that foundation is then properly shaped by the full variety of human values.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 0, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 3654, "reasoning_tokens": 512}

Setting the Problem\n\nWhen we deliberate about what to believe, two quite different families of considerations seem to press on us.\n\na. Epistemic reasons: evidence, reliability, convergence on truth, explanatory coherence, testimony of well-placed experts, etc. These reasons appear to be \u201ctruth-regarding\u201d; they point toward believing propositions that are in fact true or likely to be true.\n\nb. Practical reasons: expected benefit or harm, moral consequences of having (or failing to have) a belief, social utility, psychological well-being, the need to coordinate with others, etc. These reasons are \u201cvalue-regarding\u201d: they track how believing P will affect the agent\u2019s or others\u2019 welfare.\n\nCall an overall verdict that combines everything that legitimately bears on belief the \u201call-things-considered doxastic ought.\u201d The puzzle is that epistemic and practical reasons seem to be different in kind. If they float on distinct, incommensurable dimensions\u2014truth on the one hand, value or welfare on the other\u2014how could they ever be weighed together to yield a single verdict? Do we simply face two independent oughts, or is there a coherent way to integrate them?\n\nI shall argue (i) that the sense of incommensurability is not as deep as it first appears, and (ii) that the two families of reasons interact through a shared decision-theoretic structure centred on risk management. In brief: once we recognise that forming and maintaining a belief is an action with high-stakes consequences, the epistemic\u2013practical boundary blurs. Pragmatic factors change what counts as an acceptable level of epistemic risk; in turn, this shapes whether one is entitled to believe on the available evidence. On the model I defend, practical and epistemic reasons remain distinguishable in role, but they are comparable because both feed into a single expected-loss (or \u201cdisvalue\u201d) function that governs rational belief choice.\n\n2. Why Take Practical Reasons Seriously?\n\nA first line of resistance says that only epistemic reasons bear on belief in the strict sense; practical considerations are relevant only to what one may do with a belief already held (acting, asserting, staking one\u2019s reputation, and so on). But this evidentialist purity is hard to square with ordinary as well as philosophical cases.\n\n\u2022 High-stakes medical diagnosis. A physician with inconclusive test results may rationally suspend judgment about the presence of a dangerous infection because the cost of mistakenly believing \u201call is well\u201d is extremely high for the patient.\n\n\u2022 Clifford\u2019s ship-owner. W. K. Clifford himself actually supports a practical constraint: given the risk to the passengers, the owner ought not believe, on scant evidence, that the ship is seaworthy.\n\n\u2022 Moral encroachment cases. Suppose someone is inclined to believe that a job applicant is dishonest on the basis of weak statistical evidence that members of the applicant\u2019s ethnic group are somewhat more often dishonest. Many hold that the moral cost of forming such a racist belief blocks permissibility even if, strictly speaking, the statistical evidence makes the proposition slightly more probable.\n\nIn each example the presence of serious collateral value considerations seems to raise the evidential bar for justified belief. If that is right, practical reasons are not merely incidental\u2014they modulate epistemic standards themselves.\n\n3. Diagnosing the Incommensurability Worry\n\nPhilosophers who find the interaction between practical and epistemic reasons mysterious typically press one of two claims:\n\n(i) Content Difference: Truth and welfare are different properties; therefore, reasons aimed at those properties lack a common measure.\n\n(ii) Directive Difference: The practical \u201cought\u201d is action-guiding, whereas the epistemic \u201cought\u201d is belief-guiding; the former involves preferences, the latter involves evidential relations.\n\nBut neither difference entails incomparability. By analogy, reasons to eat a nutritious meal (health related) and reasons to eat an enjoyable meal (pleasure related) answer to different properties, yet we routinely weigh them within the same decision\u2014what shall I have for dinner? If mixed motives can be compared in the dietary case, why not in the doxastic case?\n\nThe deeper obstacle is rather structural: beliefs aim at truth in a way actions do not. According to the so-called \u201ctransparent\u201d norm of belief (Shah), in asking whether to believe P one immediately asks whether P is true. This transparency might suggest that practical considerations cannot be taken up in belief deliberation without corrupting its constitutive aim. Call this the Purity Thesis.\n\n4. Three Existing Strategies\n\nA. Dual-Ought Pluralism\n\n\u201cOne ought_e (epistemically) to believe what the evidence supports; one ought_p (practically) to believe what maximises value. Sometimes the two oughts conflict; there is simply no further fact of what one ought simpliciter to believe.\u201d\n\nAdvantages: Dumont\u2019s pluralism sustains the irreducibility of epistemic norms, thus saving the Purity Thesis. Disadvantage: It leaves agents without guidance when the oughts conflict. The notion of a dual-ranking that never coalesces into an all-things-considered verdict sits uneasily with the practical reality that we do treat beliefs as choices under risk.\n\nB. Hierarchical Reduction\n\nPure evidentialists (Clifford, Adler) say practical considerations only create indirect epistemic reasons: they affect which evidence one seeks, how closely one scrutinises counter-evidence, which hypotheses one evaluates, etc. But once the evidential set is fixed, only truth-conducive features count.\n\nCounter-example: The physician has all the evidence she\u2019s going to get; test results are on the table. Yet practical stakes still seem to require suspension of judgment. So indirect reduction under-describes the phenomenon.\n\nC. Pragmatic Encroachment (James, Fantl & McGrath)\n\n\u201cWhether S knows, or is justified in believing, that P can depend on practical stakes.\u201d Higher stakes demand stronger evidence to meet the same epistemic threshold.\n\nEncroachment acknowledges interaction but courts the \u201cmongrel\u201d worry: Does it distort the concept of knowledge (or justification) by injecting value into what should be a purely epistemic state? Also, extant encroachment accounts are often limited to knowledge; we need a direct story about reasons.\n\n5. A Unifying Solution: Belief as Risk-Sensitive Decision\n\nHere is the positive view in four steps.\n\nStep 1. Represent Belief Choice Space.\n\nFor any proposition P, an agent faces three doxastic options: Believe(P), Disbelieve(P) (i.e., believe \u00acP), or Withhold. Each option has two kinds of consequences:\n\n\u2022 Epistemic outcome: whether the option aligns with the truth-value of P.\n\u2022 Pragmatic outcome: utilities or disutilities associated with having that attitude while interacting with the world.\n\nStep 2. Assign Loss Functions That Combine Epistemic and Practical Disvalue.\n\nWe define a loss function L(a, w) where a is a doxastic attitude and w is a world-state (P true or P false). L is additive:\n\nL(a, w) = L_e(a, w) + L_p(a, w),\n\nwhere L_e captures purely epistemic cost (e.g., believing a falsehood incurs lost epistemic value), while L_p captures pragmatic cost (e.g., extra moral harm if one acts on a racist belief). Because both components are denominated in some common metric of disvalue (say, expected regret), they are straightforwardly summable.\n\nIs this charge of a common metric illegitimate? No more than when the same framework is used to integrate health versus pleasure costs in ordinary decisions. Epistemic disvalue can be rendered in utility terms: false belief (or ignorance) is instrumentally bad for almost any plan that uses information; it also arguably carries intrinsic disvalue for truth-loving creatures.\n\nStep 3. Deliberation via Expected Loss Minimisation.\n\nThe rational attitude is the one that minimises expected loss, calculated over the agent\u2019s credence function. Evidence enters as credence; stakes enter as L_p. Because the agent cannot directly \u201cchoose\u201d a credence but can choose a categorical belief policy that is sensitive to credence thresholds, the decision mirrors signal detection problems in statistics (e.g., Neyman\u2013Pearson).\n\nUnder ordinary, low-stake circumstances, epistemic loss dominates; pragmatic loss is small. The threshold for permissible belief might then be, say, 0.7 posterior probability. When pragmatic costs skyrocket\u2014lives, moral standing, severe harms\u2014raising the threshold or selecting Withhold becomes loss-minimising.\n\nStep 4. Respect Transparency via Division of Labour.\n\nDoes the decision-theoretic model force the believer to think directly about non-truth factors at the moment of belief? Not necessarily. She may internalise an operative policy: \u201cBelieve when posterior probability exceeds X.\u201d Calibration of X is what encoded the practical considerations. Once that calibration is in place, local deliberation about P can proceed purely evidentially (\u201cIs P\u2019s probability > X?\u201d), thus preserving transparency at the phenomenological level.\n\nHence practical reasons influence belief indirectly through risk thresholds, without rivaling truth as the basic aim of belief. We secure both evidential purity in immediate deliberation and integrated weighing of reasons at the policy-formation level.\n\n6. Objections and Replies\n\nObjection 1: Reductionism Cheats. By translating moral disvalue into a numerical loss, you assume commensurability rather than explaining it.\n\nReply: Explanation must end somewhere. If we accept that agents often face choices whose outcomes exhibit multiple kinds of value, then any comprehensive deliberation requires a decision rule that can process them together. The proposed loss function is not an ad hoc stipulation; it is a formal representation of the agent\u2019s all-things-considered preferences. Nothing prevents those preferences from assigning infinite or lexically dominant disvalue to certain moral violations, thereby capturing cases in which pragmatic considerations swamp epistemic ones.\n\nObjection 2: Belief Is Not Voluntary, so Decision Theory Misdescribes.\n\nReply: Doxastic voluntarism is indeed limited; but what is required for reasons to bear on belief is only a modest form of cognitive control: we can attend more or less to counter-evidence, seek additional information, adopt higher or lower credal thresholds, decide to double-check, and so forth. These reflective operations, under our model, are where risk-sensitive choice occurs. Once the threshold is endorsed, the actual occurrence of believing may be involuntary, but it is still subject to normative evaluation by reference to the earlier controlled choice.\n\nObjection 3: Some Practical Reasons, Especially Moral Ones, Are Deontic Rather Than Consequential and Therefore Cannot Be Fitted into a Loss Function.\n\nReply: Even deontic constraints can be represented. Either they impose infinite cost for violation (a hard constraint) or they impose lexicographic ordering where any violation is worse than any epistemic loss. The machinery of decision theory is general enough to encode prohibitions as non-negotiable. What matters for comparability is that there is a determinate ranking; the ranking need not be cardinal or additive.\n\n7. Advantages of the Risk Model\n\n\u2022 Unified all-things-considered verdict: We can say straightforwardly what one ought (simpliciter) to believe in light of all reasons.\n\n\u2022 Consistency with pragmatic encroachment: Variation in L_p explains why stakes modulate epistemic permissibility.\n\n\u2022 Preservation of epistemic normativity: Truth retains centrality; practical factors merely adjust acceptable error rates. The model thus avoids Jamesian subjectivism, which risks sanctioning wishful thinking.\n\n\u2022 Predictive power: It illuminates phenomena such as doxastic overconfidence in low-cost domains (sports predictions) and aversion to belief in high-cost domains (medical, moral, or legal judgments).\n\n8. Broader Theoretical Payoff\n\nThe proposed interaction framework dovetails with \u201creasons-first\u201d moral epistemology (Scanlon, Parfit) and with recent work on rational choice under imprecise probability. It also parallels work in social epistemology on group belief-forming policies: a scientific community calibrates evidential standards relative to stakes of error (e.g., drug approval vs. theoretical physics). The structure thereby captures both individual and collective dimensions.\n\n9. Conclusion\n\nThe apparent incommensurability of epistemic and practical reasons is partly an artefact of thinking of belief as a purely contemplative state detached from action. Once we acknowledge that believing is bound up with doing\u2014beliefs guide action, assertion, reliance, trust\u2014stakes inevitably enter the picture. A risk-theoretic lens lets us translate that qualitative insight into a precise mechanism for interaction. Epistemic reasons supply probabilities; practical reasons supply utilities (or disutilities); expected-loss minimisation decides.\n\nHence there is no deep mystery in how the two can combine. They do so exactly the way reasons for health and reasons for pleasure combine when one chooses dinner: by being inputs to a single choice function that ranks outcomes. What remains special about epistemic norms is not their exclusivity but their default priority: in low-stake contexts, the epistemic losses do virtually all the normative work. Only when the world renders error costly do practical considerations assert themselves.\n\nWe can thus keep the best insights of Clifford (belief must answer to evidence) and of James (sometimes the live option is forced by practical stakes) without endorsing a schizophrenic dual-ought or giving up on the possibility of an integrated, all-things-considered doxastic normativity.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 1, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 3470, "reasoning_tokens": 640}
{"question_id": "Maguire-GameBelief-2020", "question": "Some philosophers argue that there are both epistemic reasons (evidence-based) and practical reasons (concerning usefulness, harm, or moral considerations) that bear on what we ought to believe. However, these two types of reasons seem fundamentally different in kind\u2014epistemic reasons concern truth-conduciveness while practical reasons concern value or welfare. If both types of reasons genuinely bear on belief, how can they possibly interact to determine what one ought to believe, given that they seem incommensurable and thus impossible to weigh against each other directly?", "answer": "1. Introduction: setting the problem  \n\nPhilosophers have long agreed that there are epistemic reasons for belief\u2014considerations that tell in favour of believing a proposition because it is probably true. More recently a growing number of philosophers have argued that there are also practical reasons for belief\u2014considerations that tell in favour of believing because doing so will make things go better, will spare others harm, will sustain a friendship, or will bring about moral improvements. The attractiveness of pragmatist traditions in epistemology, the reality of high-stakes inquiry in science and in law, and the increasing influence of decision theory have all pushed the thought that truth is not the only good at which belief is properly aimed.  \n\nBut once we try to combine epistemic and practical reasons an old problem re-emerges. Epistemic reasons speak in the currency of probability of truth; practical reasons speak in the currency of value or utility. The two currencies do not seem to share a common scale. How, then, could they be aggregated so as to yield one overall verdict about what one ought to believe? In this paper I attempt a reconciliation. I begin (sections 2\u20133) by clarifying the kinds of \u2018ought\u2019 that are in play; I then criticise the three most familiar solutions\u2014exclusivism, lexical priority, and simple aggregation (section 4). In section 5 I offer a positive proposal: a bifocal or Pareto model of belief-guiding reasons. On this view epistemic and practical reasons are genuinely incommensurable but nonetheless jointly constrain rational belief by generating a partial ordering. When the ordering leaves an epistemic tie, practical considerations are permitted to break it; when practical considerations recommend an option that is epistemically dominated, they are silenced. I show (section 6) how the model fits with plausible accounts of doxastic agency and with concrete cases. I finish (section 7) by replying to four residual worries and sketching the implications for a broader normative pluralism.\n\n2. Distinguishing three \u2018oughts\u2019  \n\nTalk of what we \u2018ought\u2019 to believe is ambiguous. Three readings are worth separating.\n\n2.1. The epistemic ought. This is the standard norm of belief as such: believe p if and only if your total evidence makes p sufficiently likely to be true. Only evidence can satisfy the constitutive aim of belief\u2014accuracy.  \n\n2.2. The practical ought. From the standpoint of prudence or morality one ought to adopt whichever cognitive attitude maximises value: believe the comforting prognosis if it will keep the patient alive, suppress the racist stereotype if it will prevent injustice, and so on.  \n\n2.3. The all-things-considered ought. Ordinary deliberation does not compartmentalise so neatly. We often ask simply \u2018What should I believe?\u2019 implying that all the relevant considerations\u2014truth-directed and value-directed\u2014bear on a single verdict. The question that animates the current debate is whether this last verdict is coherent and, if so, how it is fixed.\n\n3. Why interaction matters  \n\nThree related arguments show that we cannot merely let the two oughts float in separate normative silos.\n\na. Rational deliberation. Agents often face choices where their practical stakes interact with their evidential thresholds (consider buying insurance, accepting pleas, or disclosing medical risks). A workable theory of rationality must tell such agents whether it is permissible to lower or raise the evidential bar in the light of those stakes.  \n\nb. Deference to experts. Experts sometimes caution a less informed agent, \u2018You do not have enough evidence to believe p, but given what is at stake you should anyway.\u2019 If these utterances are not simply confused, the normative domains are being treated as mutually relevant.  \n\nc. Higher-order evidence. Suppose I have powerful evidence but I also learn that believing on the basis of such evidence will tempt me into morally abhorrent action. That higher-order practical consideration seems to bear, at least defeasibly, on the rationality of belief itself.  \n\nHence we do need an integrated account.\n\n4. Three temptations and their limits  \n\n4.1 Exclusivism (pure evidentialism)  \n\nThe exclusivist simply denies practical reasons any bearing on belief. The main gains are conceptual simplicity and fidelity to the traditional view of belief as an involuntary aiming at truth. The losses are significant: exclusivism cannot make sense of genuine moral encroachment cases or of the intuitive permissibility of hope-laden belief in high-stakes contexts where the evidence is equally balanced.\n\n4.2 Lexical priority  \n\nA second proposal grants that practical reasons exist but says they only come into play when epistemic reasons leave the matter undecided. Call this \u2018weak pragmatism\u2019. Its virtue is that it allows both kinds of reasons without requiring commensuration. Its vice is that it appears ad hoc: why should epistemic considerations enjoy absolute priority if both are genuine normative forces? Moreover, in real life epistemic evidence is almost never exactly balanced; so practical reasons are rarely, if ever, allowed to operate.\n\n4.3 Simple aggregation  \n\nA third proposal is to map both epistemic and practical reasons onto a single utility scale\u2014\u2018epistemic utility\u2019 measures accuracy, \u2018practical utility\u2019 measures conventional value\u2014and then sum the utilities. This is the approach of strictly Bayesian epistemology with a weighted accuracy scoring rule. The trouble is that the weighting is ungrounded: how many hedons is one bit of accuracy worth? Absent a principled exchange rate, the model is either arbitrary or collapses back into one of the two earlier positions.\n\n5. A bifocal (Pareto) model of reason aggregation  \n\nMy proposal is indebted to both decision theory and to Joseph Raz\u2019s notion of incommensurable but jointly operative reasons. Begin with two assumptions:\n\nA1. Belief is governed by a constitutive aim: accuracy. This establishes a special epistemic norm.  \nA2. Human agents are nonetheless value-seekers whose beliefs play causal roles in the world; therefore practical reasons can bear\u2014if only indirectly\u2014on the rationality of adopting, sustaining, or suspending belief.\n\nFrom these assumptions we can build a model with three ingredients.\n\n5.1 Separate dimensions  \n\nWe measure accuracy on one dimension (call it the \u2018fit\u2019 axis) and practical value on a second dimension (call it the \u2018benefit\u2019 axis). There is, in general, no cardinal exchange rate between vertical and horizontal distance; the axes are orthogonal.\n\n5.2 Pareto dominance  \n\nGiven an option set {believe p, disbelieve p, suspend}, we can say that one option Pareto-dominates another when it is at least as accurate and at least as practically beneficial, and strictly better on at least one of those measures. Rationality requires avoiding dominated options. This yields a partial, not a total, ordering; some options will be incomparable.\n\n5.3 Permissive tie-breaking  \n\nWhen epistemic reasons alone strictly rank the options, practical reasons have no power to overturn that ranking. But when, relative to the evidence, two or more options tie (for instance, suspension and belief yield equal expected accuracy), then practical reasons may legitimately select among the epistemically tied options. In this sense practical considerations are conditionally decisive.\n\nThis model satisfies four desiderata:\n\n\u2022 It respects the constitutive authority of truth-conduciveness by allowing practical reasons to operate only within an epistemically permitted field.  \n\u2022 It avoids demandingly precise cardinalisation; we need only qualitative comparisons along each axis.  \n\u2022 It explains why, in high-stakes cases, agents are permitted (though not required) to raise or lower their evidential thresholds.  \n\u2022 It preserves room for moral critique: belief against overwhelming evidence is always epistemically dominated, whatever its pragmatic pay-off.\n\n6. Doxastic agency and case studies  \n\nA lingering worry is that belief is not the sort of state we choose at will; so how can practical reasons even get a grip? The short answer is that rational norms guide not only direct voluntary belief but also indirect belief-forming policies\u2014what evidence to seek, which heuristics to rely on, how stringently to audit one\u2019s reasoning. These policies are responsive to incentives. Practical reasons, on my view, bear mainly on policy selection; epistemic reasons bear on local doxastic updates.\n\n6.1 The medical prognosis  \n\nImagine a physician deciding whether to believe that an experimental drug is efficacious. The evidence is ambiguous; the expected accuracy of believing versus suspending is roughly equal. But if she forms the belief and communicates confident hope to the patient, compliance will rise and survival odds improve. Our model declares suspension and belief epistemically tied; practical reasons can licitly break the tie. Forming the hopeful belief is therefore permissible. If, by contrast, the evidence made belief slightly less accurate than suspension, the option would be epistemically dominated. Practical benefits could not rescue it.\n\n6.2 The catastrophic risk scientist  \n\nA physicist considers whether to believe that her experiment is safe. The evidence is strong but not conclusive. Practical stakes are immense: if she is wrong, billions die. Here the practical dimension radically magnifies the cost of error, effectively raising the threshold at which belief ceases to be Pareto dominated. Under our model the physicist must either gather more evidence or suspend. Belief is epistemically permissible in the abstract\u2014her evidence is pretty good\u2014but practically dominated given the catastrophic downside. Hence the all-things-considered ought advises suspension.\n\n6.3 Moral contamination  \n\nSuppose I have strong evidence that a social group is genetically inferior. Accepting the belief would reinforce racist policies that are morally abhorrent. Most of us think I ought not believe, even if the evidence (we stipulate for the example) is strong. My model captures the intuition: the moral cost utterly swamps the slight epistemic gain of accepting the proposition over suspending. Because suspension, while marginally less accurate, avoids grave harm, belief is practically dominated and so prohibited.\n\n7. Replies to four objections  \n\nObjection 1: Epistemic normativity is sui generis; mixing it with practical value violates its autonomy. Reply: Autonomy is preserved by the Pareto framework. The epistemic dimension is never traded off; it is only combined with the practical dimension to eliminate dominated options.\n\nObjection 2: The model makes rationality context-sensitive and therefore unstable. Reply: Yes\u2014rational thresholds vary with stakes. But this is a feature, not a bug, of real inquiry; it aligns with empirical findings on adaptive decision-making.\n\nObjection 3: The account licenses wishful thinking whenever the stakes are high. Reply: Not so. Wishful thinking typically involves belief contrary to the weight of evidence. My model forbids that; practical reasons cannot vindicate epistemically disfavoured options.\n\nObjection 4: Pareto dominance leaves too much indeterminacy; we want single-point prescriptions. Reply: Normative life is sometimes permissive. Where both accuracy and value are tied, multiple attitudes may be rationally permissible. Agents can settle the matter by adopting second-order commitments\u2014e.g. heuristics of conservatism or optimism.\n\n8. Conclusion: toward a pluralist but unified normativity  \n\nThe incommensurability of epistemic and practical reasons need not condemn us to fragmentation. A bifocal, dominance-based model honours the distinctive authority of truth while acknowledging the moral and prudential stakes that make belief consequential. The account vindicates ordinary deliberative practice: we often weigh what is likely to be true against what is costly to be wrong about, and we find some beliefs morally off-limits despite evidential support. Instead of a flat summation or a lexical hierarchy, we get a structured pluralism: epistemic reasons set necessary conditions, practical reasons supply sufficient conditions when epistemic ones leave room.\n\nThis reconciliation has wider implications. It suggests that normative domains can interact without collapsing into a single master value. It shows how deontic verdicts can be generated by partial orderings rather than by impracticably fine comparisons. And it opens the door to a general theory of rational agency in which aims are multiple, reasons are incommensurable, yet rationality remains intelligible. The interaction of epistemic and practical reasons is thus not a clash of irreconcilables but a case study in pluralist integration\u2014an integration that mirrors the complexity of our intellectual and moral lives.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 2, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 3173, "reasoning_tokens": 576}

If that were the only normative dimension relevant to belief, matters would be simple: what one ought to believe would be fixed exclusively by evidential or other truth\u2010conducive considerations.  Yet ordinary deliberation suggests a richer phenomenology.  The terrified patient who must decide whether to trust a grim medical prognosis, the shipowner who is tempted to believe that his vessel is seaworthy in order to avoid costly repairs, or William James\u2019s devotee wondering whether \u201cforced, vital, momentous\u201d religious decisions permit leaping beyond the evidence\u2014all face an apparent conflict between the epistemic pressure exerted by their evidence and the practical pressure exerted by their interests, moral obligations, or welfare.  If both kinds of pressure constitute genuine reasons, we face an integration problem: epistemic reasons are about accuracy; practical reasons are about value.  How can they possibly interact if they appear to be measured on different scales?\n\nI argue for a pluralist solution built out of five steps.\n\n1.  Distinguish levels of normative assessment: an epistemic \u201cought,\u201d a practical \u201cought,\u201d and an all\u2010things\u2010considered \u201cought.\u201d\n\n2.  Model doxastic deliberation as a form of agency constrained by partial control; once belief is acknowledged as an activity with predictable consequences, epistemic and practical considerations enter a common currency of reasons for action.\n\n3.  Treat truth\u2010conduciveness and utility as heterogenous but commensurable via higher\u2010order values the agent (or a rational evaluator) legitimately possesses: roughly, accuracy has intrinsic value, but it is not lexically supreme.\n\n4.  Define a decision procedure using dominance\u2010based thresholds: ordinary stakes license the dominance of epistemic reasons; extraordinary stakes trigger a pragmatic override only when epistemic reasons fall below a contextually specified sufficiency threshold.\n\n5.  Show that such a procedure explains paradigmatic cases and avoids three leading objections: (a) that it collapses the distinctively epistemic; (b) that it assumes full voluntarism about belief; and (c) that it yields an objectionably permissive doxastic ethics.\n\nThe result is not a reductive unification of reasons, but a structured pluralism in which each kind of reason keeps its identity while nevertheless figuring in integrated practical deliberation about what one, tout court, ought to believe.\n\nI.  The Incommensurability Worry\n\nReasons generate normative force: they \u201ccount in favor\u201d of an attitude or action.  But to count in favor they must be weighable; you and I must be able to see why the stronger set of reasons \u201cwins.\u201d  When the properties in virtue of which reasons possess force are wholly different, comparability threatens to break down.  Epistemic reasons derive their force from accuracy, a representational excellence.  Practical reasons derive theirs from value or welfare, i.e. the consequences of occupying the belief state.  The philosopher\u2019s challenge is therefore: how can force grounded in accuracy be weighed against force grounded in, say, preventing catastrophe, given that accuracy and catastrophe\u2010prevention are not obviously comparable?\n\nMany responses deny one of the competitors.  Evidentialists (Clifford, Conee & Feldman) treat practical considerations as strictly irrelevant to the epistemic \u201cought.\u201d  Pragmatists (Peirce, James) sometimes flirt with the inverse claim that the ultimate function of cognition is action guidance, so epistemic merit is derivative of practical value.  Both maneuvers avoid incommensurability by fiat: they deny that two heterogeneous reasons ever interact.  Yet each faces counter\u2010examples.  The shipowner who suppresses lingering doubts to save money seems blameworthy despite sharing Clifford\u2019s high evidential bar; conversely, the mountain climber who forms the life\u2010preserving belief \u201cI can make the jump\u201d despite flimsy evidence seems epistemically criticizable even if practically excusable.  These cases suggest that both kinds of normative pull are genuine: we sometimes admire the climber\u2019s doxastic courage while criticising her epistemic rashness, and we struggle to decide what she, all\u2010things\u2010considered, ought to have believed.  A more satisfying theory must therefore retain both species of reason and explain their interaction.\n\nII.  Level\u2010Distinctions and Domain\u2010Relativity\n\nA first step is to separate domain\u2010relative \u201coughts.\u201d  Let:\n\n\u2022  OEp(p) mean \u201cOne epistemically ought to believe p,\u201d determined solely by evidence, reliability, explanatory virtues, and related truth\u2010conducive factors.\n\n\u2022  OPr(p) mean \u201cOne practically ought to believe p,\u201d determined by what believing p would prudentially or morally promote.\n\nNothing so far is controversial.  The hard part is formulating the all\u2010things\u2010considered directive OATC(p), the composition of which must respect both OEp and OPr without erasing their differences.\n\nWe have good precedent for domain\u2010relativity.  A doctor confronting a terminal patient might say, \u201cFrom a medical standpoint you ought to undergo chemotherapy, but from a personal standpoint you may prefer palliative care.\u201d  The patient\u2019s all\u2010things\u2010considered choice integrates rather than eliminates the distinct norms.  Likewise, when Aristotle distinguished theoretical wisdom (sophia) from practical wisdom (phronesis) he did not imagine that the two never interact; rather, he insisted on intellectual virtue as one component within a broader ethical calculus.\n\nIII.  Doxastic Agency and Pragmatic Consequences\n\nA lingering worry is that beliefs are not under voluntary control, so practical reasons cannot be reasons for believing.  But complete voluntarism is unnecessary.  Belief formation is diachronically responsive to deliberative inputs: we decide which evidence to collect, which inquiry to prolong, which counter\u2010considerations to suppress, and we can intentionally cultivate credal dispositions through social or psychological practices.  That degree of control suffices for normative appraisal; after all, we blame negligence in perception (\u201cYou should have looked both ways\u201d) despite the involuntariness of visual experience.\n\nOnce belief is recognised as a controllable cognitive act with predictable downstream behavioural and affective effects, it becomes a suitable object of practical reason.  The belief that your parachute is properly packed may be a prerequisite for calmly exiting an airplane; the belief that your friend is trustworthy sustains a friendship.  Because these effects are valuable or disvaluable, there are prudential and moral stakes associated with occupying various doxastic states.  Therefore practical reasons do, after all, bear on belief.\n\nIV.  A Common Currency: Higher\u2010Order Values\n\nStill, we have not yet solved the commensurability puzzle.  My suggestion is that we take inspiration from multi\u2010objective decision theory.  A classic model assigns utilities to outcomes along several dimensions and then aggregates them after applying appropriate weights.  Another employs lexicographic ordering: one dimension dominates unless it falls below a sufficiency threshold, after which subordinate dimensions may become decisive.  Both strategies show that different kinds of value can be rendered jointly actionable without collapsing them into homogeneity.\n\nHow does this apply to belief?  Start by noting that truth has both intrinsic and instrumental value.  Its intrinsic value is epistemic; its instrumental value consists in facilitating successful action.  That dual nature provides an initial bridge.  Next, allow that agents rationally care about at least two goods: (a) accuracy, and (b) practical utility (which might include moral duty).  They can therefore attach weights to these goods, even if the weights are imprecise or context\u2010sensitive.  If the goods truly were incomparable, agents could never face tradeoffs; but agents routinely do face and resolve them\u2014think of doctors prescribing a treatment with well\u2010known side\u2010effects.  So any purported incommensurability between accuracy and utility is at most moderate: comparison is difficult, but not impossible.\n\nAn objection looms: if I can attach arbitrary weights, do I not license believing any comforting falsehood when I assign utility a high enough weight?  The answer is no, because accuracy is not merely one value among many; it enjoys a defeasible priority grounded in the constitutive aim of belief.  To count as believing at all, your state must be aimed at truth in a non\u2010accidental way (Shah & Velleman\u2019s transparency).  That constitutive aim imposes a default dominance rule: epistemic considerations normally trump, unless the expected practical disvalue of inaccuracy crosses a contextually specific catastrophe threshold.\n\nV.  A Threshold Model for the All\u2010Things\u2010Considered Ought\n\nWe can formalise the intuitive dominance rule by adapting a threshold conception of justification familiar from legal contexts (\u201cbeyond reasonable doubt,\u201d \u201cclear and convincing evidence,\u201d etc.).\n\nLet E be the degree of evidential support for proposition p on a scale [0,1], and let S be the practical stake of erring regarding p (also on [0,1], where 0 = trivial and 1 = catastrophic).  Define a threshold function T(S) such that:\n\n\u2022  For low stakes (S \u2264 s\u2080) the threshold is high: T(S) \u2248 0.9.\n\n\u2022  For moderate stakes (s\u2080 < S < s\u2081) the threshold drops gradually.\n\n\u2022  For catastrophic stakes (S \u2265 s\u2081) the threshold may approach the minimal level compatible with belief formation (say T(S) = 0.5).\n\nThen the all\u2010things\u2010considered norm says:\n\n(OATC)  One ought to believe p iff (i) E \u2265 T(S), and (ii) no overriding deontic constraint (e.g. moral prohibition on self\u2010deception) forbids forming p.\n\nThree observations:\n\n1.  Under ordinary circumstances\u2014low or moderate stakes\u2014the evidential bar remains stringent, so the theory behaves much like evidentialism.\n\n2.  As stakes climb, the practical reason to avoid harmful error tells in favor of relaxing the required evidential support; however, truth still matters, because the agent must aim to clear the lower but non\u2010trivial threshold.\n\n3.  The model vindicates the everyday judgment that high stakes sometimes justify believing on the basis of evidence that would be insufficient were the stakes lower.\n\nA further refinement allows asymmetry with respect to positive and negative outcomes, capturing the well\u2010known phenomenon that false positives and false negatives differ in their practical cost.\n\nVI.  Testing the Model on Canonical Cases\n\nA.  Clifford\u2019s Shipowner  \nClifford damns the shipowner who convinces himself his vessel is seaworthy without adequate inspection.  On my model, the stake S is enormous: many lives may be lost.  Yet the proper response is not to relax evidential standards; it is to increase investigative diligence so that E crosses an even higher threshold.  Thus my view agrees with Clifford\u2019s verdict: because the owner could and should have raised E before permitting belief, and failed to do so, his practical and epistemic reasons align against believing.\n\nB.  The Mountain Climber  \nSuppose the only way to survive is to leap a wide crevasse; performance degrades if she believes she will fail.  Here S is existential.  Unfortunately the evidential support for \u201cI can make the jump\u201d may be weak, say E = 0.4.  Our threshold drops under catastrophic stakes\u2014perhaps to 0.3.  Belief is therefore permitted (and may even be required) despite epistemic risk.  Crucially, the threshold is not zero; were the gap obviously too wide (E = 0.1), belief would remain prohibited despite the stakes.  There is no license for magical thinking.\n\nC.  James\u2019s Religious Hypothesis  \nJames calls the choice \u201cforced, living, and momentous,\u201d and so high\u2010stakes.  But he also emphasises that mundane evidence cannot settle the matter.  On the threshold model, E sits roughly at agnosticism (0.5) while S may be rated by the agent as high because eternal salvation is at stake.  If the agent sincerely assigns those utilities, the threshold drops enough to permit belief.  Nothing compels belief; but practical reasons render belief permissible.\n\nVII.  Answering Three Objections\n\n1.  Collapse of the Epistemic  \nIf practical reasons can occasionally override evidential deficiency, does the distinctively epistemic disappear?  No, because override is exceptional, structured, and threshold\u2010regulated.  For the overwhelming majority of quotidian beliefs\u2014what time the bus departs, whether the kettle is boiling\u2014stakes are low, and pure evidentialism reigns.  The theory does not assimilate epistemic reasons to practical ones; it describes conditions under which practical reasons constrain the evidential standard.\n\n2.  Involuntarism  \nEven if belief is not fully voluntary, we can be sensitive to reasons through indirect control.  Cognitive architecture evolved for flexible updating; motivational states modulate attention and weighting of evidence.  So when the mountain climber \u201cdecides to believe,\u201d what she actually decides is to stop searching for further disconfirming evidence and allow herself to be convinced by optimistic considerations that were already present but previously suspended.  Such second\u2010order regulation is under intentional control and therefore can be the locus of practical reasons.\n\n3.  Permissivism Untethered  \nCritics fear that once we admit pragmatic slack, anti\u2010vaccination parents will \u201cbelieve for the child\u2019s sake\u201d that vaccines are dangerous, or cult followers will believe comforting prophecies.  Yet in these cases, either S is not as high as they represent or E is far below even a relaxed threshold.  Moreover, the model incorporates moral side\u2010constraints forbidding harmful self\u2010deception.  Thus it is demanding in the right way: only genuine, non\u2010ideological catastrophe combined with moderate evidential support suffices for pragmatic override.\n\nVIII.  Why Lexical Priority, Not Simple Aggregation?\n\nWhy adopt a threshold rather than a continuous trade\u2010off?  Because the constitutive aim of belief confers lexical priority on truth: if believing were never regulated by a truth\u2010first norm, the attitude would cease to be recognisable as belief rather than imagination or make\u2010believe.  Thresholds preserve that lexical insight while still permitting pragmatic flexibility when life, limb, or morality hang in the balance.\n\nIX.  Comparison with Competitors\n\n\u2022  Pure Evidentialism cannot explain why it seems permissible, perhaps admirable, for the terminally ill patient to believe recovery likely when the evidence is bleak but not decisive.\n\n\u2022  Pragmatism that reduces the epistemic to the practical cannot explain why the earnest flat\u2010earther, whose belief provides community and psychological comfort, remains epistemically criticizable.\n\n\u2022  Stacey/Weatherson\u2010style pragmatic encroachment in semantics claims that knowledge standards vary with stakes; my view is compatible but retains the independent notion of evidence\u2010sensitive epistemic rightness, whereas the encroachment theorist risks conflating knowledge with practical reason.\n\nThus pluralist thresholdism secures the explanatory advantages of both camps.\n\nX.  The Larger Moral\n\nWe began with an apparent dilemma: either deny practical reasons or else jettison the autonomy of the epistemic.  Pluralist thresholdism shows that this is a false dilemma.  The structure of practical deliberation already accommodates heterogeneous goods\u2014justice, welfare, solidarity, beauty\u2014without reducing them to a single dimension.  Accuracy is simply another such good, distinguished by its centrality to the very nature of belief.  By endowing accuracy with defeasible lexical priority, we obtain a principled method for integrating epistemic and practical considerations.\n\nXI.  Conclusion\n\nWhat one ought to believe, all things considered, emerges from an interaction between two normative domains.  Epistemic reasons set the default: believe according to the evidence.  Practical reasons are empowered to raise or lower the evidential threshold in proportion to what is at stake, but they cannot eliminate the requirement that evidence meet at least a minimal sufficiency standard.  This dual\u2010level picture preserves the integrity of truth\u2010directed cognition while acknowledging that believing is an activity embedded in lives that can go better or worse depending on what we believe.  It therefore resolves the incommensurability worry: the reasons are not measured on the same scale, but they come under a common decision\u2010procedure that reflects their relative normative roles.\n\nThe soundness of pluralist thresholdism does not rest on exact numerical weights; real agents may think in qualitative terms (\u201chigh,\u201d \u201cmoderate,\u201d \u201clow\u201d).  What matters is the structural insight: there is a principled path from heterogeneous reasons to integrated verdicts.  Far from undermining the independence of epistemic normativity, the presence of practical reasons illuminates its practical significance.  We care about forming true beliefs partly because truth is intrinsically good, and partly because, at the end of the day, our lives go better when we get things right.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 3, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 4412, "reasoning_tokens": 896}

Introduction: the shape of the puzzle\n\nThere is a venerable and intuitive thought that what one ought to believe is wholly determined by one\u2019s evidence. Call that thesis \u201cPure Evidentialism.\u201d At the same time, there is an equally venerable and intuitive thought that sometimes believing against (or in advance of) the evidence can be rationally required, or at least rationally permissible, because of the consequences of believing or failing to believe. The history of philosophy is littered with examples: Pascal\u2019s Wager, James\u2019s \u201cwill to believe,\u201d self-fulfilling faith in a climbing rope, doxastic wronging of marginalised informants, belief that keeps a depressive person alive, and so on. Call the reasons appealed to in such cases \u201cpractical reasons for belief.\u201d  \n\nThe problem is not merely that there appear to be two kinds of reasons. The deeper problem is that those reasons seem to be of different kinds in a way that rules out straightforward comparison. Epistemic reasons point to truth; practical reasons point to (moral, prudential, or political) value. If so, how could a single normative verdict\u2014\u201cAll-things-considered you ought to believe p (rather than \u00ad\u00acp or suspend)\u201d\u2014ever be responsive to both? Aren\u2019t we attempting to add apples and hedgehogs?  \n\nIn what follows I set out a way of understanding the interaction that neither collapses the distinction between epistemic and practical reasons nor produces an intractable incommensurability. The strategy has three stages:\n\n(1) Clarify what a reason is and show that \u201creason simpliciter\u201d already provides a thin, shared currency.  \n(2) Distinguish two levels of evaluation: a first-level domain of belief-formation and a second-level meta-norm that governs conflicts between domains.  \n(3) Offer a weighted, but non-arbitrary, model of interaction: epistemic reasons enjoy lexical priority up to a threshold determined by a background axiology that assigns but does not absolutise the value of truth.\n\nThe resulting picture permits genuine practical encroachment on the verdict about what one ought to believe, while still explaining why the weight of epistemic reasons ordinarily dwarfs practical considerations.\n\n2. What reasons are\n\nA reason, in the broadest normative sense, is a consideration that counts in favour of some attitude or action. This very abstract characterisation is neutral with respect to whether the attitude is an action (raising one\u2019s hand) or a doxastic state (believing that p). It is also neutral with respect to the content of the consideration: it may be that p would promote welfare, or that p follows from what one already knows, or that p is morally demanded.  \n\nBecause the function \u201ccounts in favour\u201d is thin, the mere fact that one reason promotes truth while another promotes welfare does not by itself yield complete incommensurability. It is the same kind of relation (normative favouring) that each bears to the attitude. The difference lies in what grounds the favouring. Thinking of reasons this way secures a preliminary point: the possibility of comparison is not ruled out at the semantic level; it is a substantive question whether the grounds of favouring create insuperable barriers to trade-offs.\n\n3. The temptation to collapse\n\nOne way to remove the apparent incommensurability is to attempt reduction: (a) practical reasons are always epistemic after all (because believing truth is always practically best); or (b) epistemic reasons are always practical (because the only value of truth is its instrumental role). Both reductions have been extensively criticised. Option (a) cannot explain why in high-stakes cases a tiny evidential increase may fail to offset gargantuan practical risk. Option (b) threatens to erase any difference between believing and merely acting as if p. Since we do intuitively condemn wishful thinking even when it might be instrumentally useful, it seems that the two kinds of reason are genuinely distinct.  \n\n4. The temptation to insulate\n\nA second strategy says that the distinctness is so deep that only one kind of reason can bear on belief at all. Traditional evidentialists (e.g. Clifford, Conee & Feldman) allow only epistemic reasons. Pragmatists of a more radical stripe (some strands of Dewey, certain contemporary \u201cfaith\u201d theorists) allow practical reasons full sway and treat evidential constraints as a species of prudence: we usually care about truth because it is instrumentally valuable, but we may discard that constraint.  \n\nBoth monisms run into counter-examples. Pure Evidentialism cannot handle tie-cases: when the evidence favours neither p nor \u00acp, suspension is the epistemic verdict. Yet sometimes suspension is seriously harmful or morally unconscionable (e.g., withholding belief in the trustworthiness of vaccine science when public testimony from experts is stymied). Pure Pragmatism, on the other hand, legitimises epistemic wish-fulfilment in low-stakes circumstances in a way that seems repugnant to the very concept of belief.  \n\nPrecisely because neither collapse nor insulation works, we require an interaction model.\n\n5. Two-level normative structure\n\nThink of normative governance as having two levels.\n\nLevel 1: Domain-internal standards.  \n\u2022 For action, there are moral, prudential, aesthetic standards.  \n\u2022 For belief, there is (at least) the epistemic standard of truth-conduciveness.\n\nLevel 2: Meta-normative aggregation.  \n\u2022 When the same attitude or choice is governed by multiple domains, we need a rule to decide the \u201call-things-considered\u201d verdict.\n\nThat level-2 rule is itself normative and can be defended or criticised. The crucial point is that cross-domain aggregation need not require that the underlying values be measurable on a single cardinal scale; it may rely instead on ordinal comparisons or on lexical principles familiar from moral theory.\n\nConsider moral philosophy: we routinely choose between saving one life (welfare) and keeping a promise (deontic constraint) even though the two grounds of reasons\u2014welfare and duty\u2014are different. We do so by appeal to higher-order deliberative principles: e.g., duties have lexical priority over welfare up to a threshold of catastrophic harm. There is no reason in principle why something analogous cannot apply to epistemic versus practical reasons.\n\n6. Lexical priority with a threshold\n\nHere, then, is the main proposal:\n\nEpistemic Lexical Priority Principle (ELPP): Epistemic reasons to believe p ordinarily outrank practical reasons, but their priority is not absolute; when epistemic reasons are below a threshold of decisiveness\u2014i.e., when they fail to mandate belief or disbelief\u2014practical reasons may tip the balance.\n\nThis is in spirit close to William James\u2019s \u201cRight to Believe\u201d: where the evidential situation is live, forced, and momentous, it is permissible to let practical considerations decide. ELPP strengthens James by formulating a lexically ordered system:  \n\nStage 1. Ask whether the epistemic reasons decisively support believing, disbelieving, or suspending.  \nStage 2. If the epistemic case is decisive (either way), the all-things-considered verdict is set; practical reasons can at most supply instrumental reasons to take steps toward acquiring more evidence.  \nStage 3. If the epistemic reasons are underdetermining (a tie, or near-tie), consult practical reasons; they may ground permission or even obligation to believe.  \n\nThe threshold can be understood probabilistically: if the evidential probability of p is, say, 0.9, that may be decisive. If it is 0.5, the door is open. The exact value is not fixed a priori; different contexts (science, courtroom, everyday life) legitimately set different standards of decisiveness.\n\n7. Why lexical rather than additive?\n\nCould we not simply assign numerical utilities\u2014say, +10 for true belief, \u221210 for false belief, plus whatever practical utilities accrue\u2014and then maximise expected value? Decision-theoretic models have the virtue of commensurating everything. But they risk two opposite errors. First, they can licence wholesale wishful thinking whenever the practical stakes become extreme, because any finite disutility of false belief can be swamped. Second, they mismodel the phenomenology of inquiry: scientists do not treat belief as a bet; they treat it as answerable to the world.  \n\nLexical priority captures the near-categorical importance truth has in the practice of belief while still making room for stakes. Compare moral constraints: many philosophers think there is a near-categorical prohibition on killing innocents, yet few think the prohibition is literally infinite in weight; we can imagine (albeit fanciful) cases of catastrophic harm that override it. Similarly, the epistemic domain enjoys strong but not infinite priority.\n\n8. How interaction works in practice\n\nCase 1: High evidence, high but opposing stakes  \nSuppose a prosecutor is convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty (probability 0.95). Public unrest would be quelled by believing him innocent. ELPP says she ought to believe he is guilty. Her epistemic reasons are decisive; the practical reasons do not get a hearing.  \n\nCase 2: Marginal evidence, catastrophic stakes  \nYou are a mountaineer about to cross a rickety bridge. Evidence of the bridge\u2019s safety is 0.4. If you believe it is safe you will cross confidently, which increases the objective chance of surviving. If you suspend belief you will turn back, but hypothermia will almost certainly kill you. ELPP says practical reasons may legitimately tip you toward believing the bridge is safe. Because the evidence was under the decisiveness threshold, the door was open.  \n\nCase 3: Symmetric evidence, moral stakes  \nYou are a doctor confronted with inconclusive studies about a life-saving but risky drug. Believing the drug is beneficial may spur you to join a trial that will save patients. Suspending belief may doom them. Again, provided the evidence is insufficient to decisively ground either attitude, moral reasons may supply an obligation to believe.  \n\nNotice that in none of these cases are we ignoring epistemic reasons; we are locating the space where they are indeterminate and allowing practical reasons to adjudicate.\n\n9. Addressing the incommensurability worry\n\nBut is lexical ordering merely a promissory note that absolves us of making genuine trade-offs? No; it relies on a background axiology in which truth has a very high, but finite, value. That axiology itself can be defended:\n\na. Constitutive value: Truth is constitutive of belief\u2019s aim. Just as medicine aims at health, belief aims at truth. That supplies a reason to give truth priority.  \n\nb. Instrumental and social value: True beliefs reliably promote all other values (survival, cooperation, justice). That explains why the priority is strong.  \n\nc. Non-absolutism: Even the constitutive aim is not exceptionless. Belief is a human practice embedded in a web of other values; those values can, in extremis, override the constitutive aim\u2014just as surgeons can cut healthy flesh to save a life.\n\nBecause the axiology is pluralistic, there is no single metric, but there is enough structure (ordinal plus thresholds) to support justified comparative verdicts. We make peace with the absence of precise cardinal weights by recognising the ubiquity of \u201cimprecise comparison\u201d in practical reason (Broome, Chang). The reasons can be comparable without being precisely measurable.\n\n10. Objection: irrationality of belief at will\n\nA common objection to practical reasons for belief is that we cannot form beliefs at will; only evidence can move belief. Two replies:\n\nFirst, the claim is overstated. We can often shift our credences by attending to favourable data, by ceasing to rehearse counter-evidence, by exposing ourselves to certain testimony. These are indirect, but they suffice for normative governance.  \n\nSecond, even if belief is involuntary, reasons can still bear on involuntary states. If after a concussion you ought to remember your family\u2019s names but cannot, the inability does not erase the normative claim; it merely triggers a derivative \u201cought implies can\u201d question and may shift the level of assessment from blameworthiness to, say, mechanical intervention. Similarly, practical reasons can rationally demand that one adopt mechanisms (gather evidence, seek counselling) that they expect to result in the desired belief.\n\n11. Objection: contamination of the epistemic domain\n\nSome worry that allowing practical reasons into belief undermines the reliability of science and testimony. But lexical ordering reassures us: in precisely the contexts that matter most\u2014scientific inquiry, legal standards, historical scholarship\u2014the evidential threshold for decisiveness is set extremely high. That is why practical encroachment rarely occurs there; it becomes pertinent mainly in lay or urgent contexts, where underdetermination is common.\n\n12. Comparison with \u201cpragmatic encroachment\u201d in epistemology\n\nRecent work on pragmatic encroachment (Stanley, Fantl & McGrath) argues that the practical stakes help determine whether one knows. My proposal is related but distinct: it concerns what one ought to believe, not what credences amount to knowledge. Nevertheless the articulation of thresholds dovetails with \u201cinterest-relative\u201d accounts of knowledge. One way to read ELPP is as a normative counterpart to those descriptive theories.\n\n13. Wider implications\n\nThe two-level, threshold-with-priority model illuminates debates beyond belief. Consider moral testimony: are we permitted to rely on experts for moral belief? If the evidence that the experts are reliable is decisive, we ought to believe them even if personal autonomy values point the other way; if the evidence is shaky, the practical value of autonomous reflection may permissibly lead us to withhold belief. The same structure appears.  \n\nLikewise in political epistemology: deciding whether to believe democratic processes are fair involves both epistemic inputs (studies, statistics) and practical stakes (the illegitimacy of civil unrest). Our model offers a principled explanation of how citizens can rationally navigate such issues.\n\n14. Conclusion\n\nThe initial puzzle arose from the apparent heterogeneity of epistemic and practical reasons. By distinguishing the level at which such reasons compete (level 2) from the level at which they are generated (level 1), and by adopting a lexically ordered threshold model, we can preserve:\n\n\u2022 the constitutive importance of truth to belief;  \n\u2022 the real and sometimes decisive role of practical considerations;  \n\u2022 the intelligibility of cross-domain aggregation without a single cardinal scale.\n\nReasons in different domains are not incommensurable in the strong sense that rules out rational comparison; they are only incommensurable in a weak sense that forbids simple additive trade-offs. Once we see that rational agents routinely employ lexical and threshold principles to integrate heterogeneous values, the mystery dissolves.  \n\nThus both epistemic reasons and practical reasons genuinely bear on what we ought to believe, and they do so by participating in a unified but pluralistic normative economy: epistemic reasons speak first and with commanding authority, yet their authority is not tyrannical. In the space that remains when truth\u2019s voice falls silent or stammers, prudence, morality, and politics may permissibly, and sometimes obligatorily, fill the gap.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 4, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 4127, "reasoning_tokens": 896}
{"question_id": "Maguire-GameBelief-2020", "question": "Some philosophers argue that there are both epistemic reasons (evidence-based) and practical reasons (concerning usefulness, harm, or moral considerations) that bear on what we ought to believe. However, these two types of reasons seem fundamentally different in kind\u2014epistemic reasons concern truth-conduciveness while practical reasons concern value or welfare. If both types of reasons genuinely bear on belief, how can they possibly interact to determine what one ought to believe, given that they seem incommensurable and thus impossible to weigh against each other directly?", "answer": "Epistemic-pragmatic conflicts are as old as philosophy itself.  Socrates refused to give up the examined life even when it cost him his own, while Pascal famously exhorted the agnostic to risk belief in order to win eternal bliss.  These cases tempt us to say that there are genuinely different kinds of normative considerations that bear on belief.  Epistemic reasons tell us what the evidence supports; practical reasons tell us what will protect friendships, promote happiness, or advance justice.  Yet if both kinds of reason are genuine, the following puzzle arises:\n\nIncommensurability Puzzle  \n(1) Epistemic reasons are truth-focused: they derive their normative force from the constitutive aim of belief, namely accuracy.  \n(2) Practical reasons are value-focused: they derive their force from the bearing of a belief on welfare, morality, or other non-epistemic goods.  \n(3) If reasons differ in kind in this way, there seems to be no common metric on which they could be balanced.  \n(4) Nevertheless, we speak without paradox of what one \u201cought, all things considered, to believe.\u201d  \nHow, then, could such heterogeneous reasons jointly determine a single overall doxastic verdict?\n\nThis essay defends a two-level, interactionist answer.  In brief:  \n\u2022 Epistemic and practical reasons apply to distinct but nested agential roles\u2014first-order believing and second-order doxastic self-management.  \n\u2022 The first-order role is governed solely by epistemic reasons; within it, practical reasons are structurally \u201cscreened off.\u201d  \n\u2022 Practical reasons enter only at the second level, where we decide what doxastic policies to adopt, which inquiries to undertake, and whether to put ourselves in situations that predictably produce one belief rather than another.  \nBecause the two kinds of reasons bear on different decisions, their conjunction avoids head-on commensurability worries, even though they can indirectly influence the same eventual belief.  The upshot is a pluralistic, non-reductive but unified picture: there really are epistemic and practical reasons, yet there is no genuine mystery about how they cooperate.\n\nI.  Mapping the Terrain  \n\n1.  Exclusivism.  Evidentialists such as Clifford insist that \u201cit is wrong always, everywhere, and for anyone, to believe anything on insufficient evidence.\u201d  On this view only epistemic reasons are reasons for belief; practical considerations are at most reasons to wish we believed, or to make ourselves believe, or to pretend to believe, but they are not reasons that rationalize the belief itself.\n\n2.  Pragmatism.  James counters that belief aims not merely at cold accuracy but at a \u201cvital good\u201d: the goods made available only if we venture beyond the evidence.  Pragmatism thus allows (indeed celebrates) directly practical reasons for belief.\n\n3.  Dual-Competence Theories.  A growing literature (e.g. Reisner, Weatherson, Whiting) tries to accommodate both sides by granting that there are two distinct normative domains.  But these accounts face the weighing problem: how do we arrive at a single \u201cought, simpliciter\u201d?\n\nThe present proposal belongs to the third family but dissolves the weighing problem by showing that the apparently rival reasons do not compete for the same normative slot.\n\nII.  The Constitutive Aim Argument  \n\nA belief, unlike a guess or a hope, purports to represent reality accurately.  As Velleman, Owens, and Shah have argued, this \u201caim at truth\u201d is constitutive: if a state is not governed by a norm of truth, it is not the attitude we call belief.  From this it follows that the correctness condition for any token belief is wholly epistemic: the belief is correct iff its content is true.  Practical benefits cannot make a false belief correct, nor render an evidentially unsupported belief rational in the strictly epistemic sense.\n\nThis point establishes epistemic priority at the *first order*: when one is already deliberating about whether to affirm p, the sole relevant question is whether p is likely to be true.  Appreciating this priority removes the intuitive pressure to let practical considerations participate directly in every act of belief formation.\n\nIII.  The Practical Turn: Doxastic Self-Governance  \n\nYet human agents are not mere \u201cbelief-boxes.\u201d  We stand in a further, managerial relation to our own cognitive lives.  We decide:\n\n\u2022 how extensively to investigate;  \n\u2022 which testimony to seek;  \n\u2022 whether to expose ourselves to certain evidence at all (e.g. learning the genetic results that might burden us psychologically);  \n\u2022 whether to engage in practices\u2014meditation, therapy, propaganda\u2014that predictably push our credences up or down.\n\nCall these second-order decisions doxastic self-management.  They are undeniably under our voluntary, hence normative, control.  And here practical reasons run rampant: to protect a friendship I might *avoid* further gossip about my friend\u2019s alleged betrayal; to preserve political stability a statesman might *conceal* some inconvenient but unverified rumor from herself by refusing to read fringe outlets.\n\nCrucially, the results of second-order management can trickle down to first-order believing.  If I close my eyes to the incriminating evidence, I end up believing more easily in my friend\u2019s innocence.  Thus practical reasons can causally shape what I come to believe even though they never operate as first-order reasons *for* the belief.\n\nIV.  Distinguishing Two Oughts  \n\nWe can now articulate two clear normative layers:\n\n1. The Epistemic Ought: O_E(p) = \u201cGiven my total evidence E, I ought to believe p.\u201d  \n   Standard evidentialist standards apply here.\n\n2. The Managerial Ought: O_M(\u03c0) = \u201cGiven my full range of values, I ought to adopt doxastic policy \u03c0.\u201d  \n   Policies are evaluated by a value function that legitimately incorporates epistemic as well as practical goods.\n\nBecause policies have multi-dimensional consequences, their evaluation does require a weighing of epistemic and practical factors.  But the decision metric here is familiar: ordinary practical deliberation already integrates heterogeneous goods (health, pleasure, friendship, justice, knowledge).  Epistemic goods\u2014true belief, avoidance of error\u2014are simply added to the menu.  No special incommensurability arises at the managerial level; we trade off goods all the time.\n\nHence the original puzzle dissolves: epistemic and practical reasons do not vie for direct control over an attitude; they act on different choice points.  They interact sequentially, not competitively.\n\nV.  Addressing Objections  \n\nObjection 1: \u201cBut ordinary speakers do say \u2018All things considered, you should believe the placebo will help, because it will improve your odds of recovery.\u2019  Your two-level model predicts only \u2018You should induce that belief,\u2019 not \u2018You should have it.\u2019\u201d\n\nReply.  Ordinary language is often sloppy about levels.  When a doctor says, \u201cBelieve the placebo is potent,\u201d she typically exhorts the patient to *make it the case* that she believes.  The advice is managerial, even if its phrasing is first-order.  Compare: \u201cYou should enjoy your workout.\u201d  The speaker advises adopting policies\u2014music, pacing\u2014that will in fact make the exercise enjoyable, not commanding a brute emotional flip.\n\nObjection 2: \u201cSecond-order control over belief is too weak to carry robust obligations.  We often cannot help forming beliefs when the evidence is forceful.\u201d\n\nReply.  True, control is limited, but not absent.  Agents notoriously manipulate attention, seek congenial news sources, or steer clear of destabilizing doubts.  Even minimal control suffices for normativity; we hold people responsible for racist bias they could have mitigated.\n\nObjection 3: \u201cYour view collapses into Robert Audi's distinction between \u2018ought to investigate\u2019 and \u2018ought to believe.\u2019  Does that not leave unexplained Jamesian cases where the evidence is indecisive and practical considerations allegedly license a direct leap of faith?\u201d\n\nReply.  When evidence is genuinely indecisive\u2014epistemic permission to believe or to suspend\u2014then O_E is not violated by believing.  Practical reasons can break the tie at the managerial level: adopt the policy \u2018settle now on belief in God so that you can pursue a meaningful religious life.\u2019  The resulting belief is epistemically permissible and practically desirable.  James\u2019s insight is preserved, but without requiring practical reasons to function as first-order reasons.\n\nVI.  Comparison with Rival Hybrid Theories  \n\n1. Lexical Priority Models (e.g. Lord; Schmidt).  These grant both kinds of reason but rank epistemic reasons lexically higher: practical reasons count only when epistemic reasons are silent.  Our view is friendlier to pragmatism because practical reasons can influence belief whenever managerial options can channel credences, even when evidence is not evenly balanced.  What they cannot do is *override* clear evidence.\n\n2. Right-kind/Wrong-kind Distinction (Parfit, Lewis).  On that line, practical reasons are the wrong kind: they count as reasons to want to believe but not reasons to believe.  We agree at the first order, but we add the explanatory story of how practical reasons nevertheless shape doxastic outcomes.\n\n3. Expected Epistemic Utility Maximisation (Greaves, Pettigrew).  This framework collapses truth and utility into one currency\u2014scoring-rule accuracy.  Our account retains genuine pluralism: knowledge and welfare remain distinct goods integrated only at the policy level, not reduced.\n\nVII.  Why the Interaction Is Not Commensuration  \n\nUnderlying the original puzzle is the idea that if two reasons bear on the same conclusion, they must be commensurable.  But interaction need not be by direct comparison; it can also be mediated by temporal or hierarchical structure.  Dietary reasons not to eat the cake and social reasons to celebrate with friends interact by governing different decision nodes: *order dessert?* then *take a bite?*  Similarly, managerial reasons decide the input environment for epistemic deliberation; epistemic reasons decide the belief given that environment.\n\nWe should thus abandon a flat landscape picture where all reasons converge on a single node.  Human agency is layered.  Once the landscape is drawn in 3-D, apparent collisions reveal themselves as orthogonal vectors.\n\nVIII.  Concluding Model in Five Clauses  \n\n1. Belief, by its nature, is governed by the norm of truth.  \n2. Therefore, only evidence constitutes first-order reasons that make a belief correct or rational in the epistemic sense.  \n3. Agents also control higher-order cognitive activities\u2014seeking, avoiding, or biasing evidence\u2014and these activities can be evaluated on ordinary practical grounds.  \n4. These practical evaluations license, prohibit, or require doxastic policies whose predictable output is belief or disbelief.  \n5. Consequently, epistemic and practical reasons interact sequentially: practical reasons select the path of inquiry, epistemic reasons adjudicate within that path.  No mysterious weighing of incommensurable coins is required.\n\nIX.  Practical Implications  \n\nThe two-level model yields nuanced guidance:\n\n\u2022 Medical contexts: A doctor may permissibly refrain from ordering a marginally informative but anxiety-inducing test (managerial judgment), and once the test is not administered, the patient\u2019s evidence may legitimately support the comforting belief that she is probably healthy.\n\n\u2022 Political speech: A journalist may have a practical obligation not to propagate an unverified leak.  If the leak is not repeated, the public\u2019s epistemic obligation remains to suspend judgment.  The journalist\u2019s practical reasons have shaped what it is rational for the public to believe without themselves becoming evidence.\n\n\u2022 Religious faith: An honest seeker who lacks decisive evidence may adopt faith practices because of their existential payoff.  Engaging in those practices supplies testimonial and experiential evidence which, over time, can make belief epistemically rational.  The sequence honours both epistemic discipline and practical stakes.\n\nX.  Final Reflection  \n\nRather than searching for a single super-norm that ingests every consideration, we should embrace the layered architecture of rational agency.  The voice of evidence and the voice of value speak at different moments in the deliberative conversation.  Neither silences the other, because they address different questions.  Once those questions are properly distinguished\u2014\u201cWhat cognitive stance represents the world?\u201d versus \u201cWhat cognitive management best serves my ends?\u201d\u2014their answers can peacefully coexist.  What looked like incommensurability is revealed as division of labour.\n\nThe resulting picture is neither monistic evidentialism nor unconstrained pragmatism but an integrated pluralism.  It rescues Clifford\u2019s insight that belief is answerable to truth without denying James\u2019s lesson that life sometimes calls on us to venture beyond what the evidence currently compels.  The rational believer, like an accomplished conductor, knows when to let the practical timpani set the tempo and when to let the epistemic strings carry the melody.  The performance is unified, but the instruments keep their distinctive voices.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 5, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 3435, "reasoning_tokens": 704}

Introduction: The Shape of the Problem  \n\nPhilosophers commonly distinguish two species of reasons for belief.  \n\u2022 Epistemic reasons: considerations that bear on the truth of the proposition (e.g. perceptual evidence, testimony, statistical data).  \n\u2022 Practical reasons: considerations that bear on the desirability, moral permissibility, or prudential value of holding the belief (e.g. \u201cIf I believe that my treatment will work, I will recover faster,\u201d or \u201cIf I believe the racist pamphlet, serious social harm may follow\u201d).  \n\nThe standard worry is a worry about commensurability. Epistemic reasons appear to be truth-directed, practical reasons value-directed. If one is a monist about the aim of belief\u2014if, that is, one thinks the point of belief is nothing but truth\u2014then it is hard to see how these distinct kinds of reasons could come into normative competition. Conversely, if one thinks practical reasons sometimes do override the evidence, one must explain how reasons with seemingly incommensurable dimensions (truth vs. welfare) can be put on a single scale that determines what we \u201cought, simpliciter\u201d to believe.\n\nMy goal is to show that the incommensurability problem is less intractable than it first appears. The argument proceeds in five steps.  \n\n(1) I separate three different ways the \u201cought\u201d of belief can be understood, exposing a hidden ambiguity in the original puzzle.  \n(2) I diagnose why epistemic and practical reasons look incommensurable, by isolating two background assumptions that silently do the heavy lifting.  \n(3) I sketch three extant strategies in the literature: Reduction, Bifurcation, and Encroachment.  \n(4) I develop and defend a fourth strategy I call the Policy Model. It converts doxastic choice into an ordinary act under risk, thereby delivering a principled calculus for combining epistemic and practical reasons.  \n(5) I answer two residual objections\u2014one about doxastic voluntarism, the other about integrity\u2014showing the Policy Model survives them.  \n\nIf my argument is sound, we possess an intelligible and unified norm that adjudicates between evidence and stakes without pretending that truth and value are identical currencies.\n\n2. Three \u201cOughts\u201d  \n\nWhen philosophers ask \u201cWhat ought I believe?\u201d they sometimes conflate three different questions:  \n\nA. The epistemic ought: What attitude is most likely to achieve truth or avoid error?  \nB. The prudential or moral ought: What attitude best promotes my prudential or moral goals?  \nC. The all-things-considered ought: Given every reason of every kind, what attitude should I adopt?  \n\nThe commensurability puzzle only arises at level (C). We can happily grant that epistemic reasons have exclusive authority over (A) and practical reasons have exclusive authority over (B). The challenge is to provide an intelligible decision rule that fuses them in the all-things-considered judgment. So throughout I will presuppose that the \u201cought\u201d we seek is the all-things-considered ought unless otherwise stated.\n\n3. Why They Seem Incommensurable  \n\nTwo tacit assumptions generate the sense of an impasse.\n\nAssumption 1: Belief is a purely representational state aimed at truth.  \nIf so, the only constitutive standard for belief is accuracy, and practical upshots are, at best, externalities. Orthodoxy in much epistemology implicitly relies on this.\n\nAssumption 2: Reasons combine by lexical priority.  \nMany philosophers assume that if X and Y are reasons of different kinds, then either X always \u201ctrumps\u201d Y or vice-versa. If evidence is lexically prior, practical reasons never even enter the calculus. If value is lexically prior, the same trouble arises in reverse.\n\nOnce these assumptions are on the table, we can entertain the possibility that both are false or only partially true, thereby dissolving the appearance of incommensurability.\n\n4. Three Standard Strategies  \n\n4.1 Reduction (Pragmatist reductionism)  \nPragmatists such as James and (on one reading) Bas van Fraassen propose that truth itself is to be analyzed in practical terms, or that the evidential relevance of a consideration is just its utility in belief-formation. This eliminates dualism at the cost of an implausible account of evidence: the sugar pill that improves your health does not thereby raise the probability that \u201chomeopathy works.\u201d Reductionism therefore fails to respect the autonomy of epistemic reasons.\n\n4.2 Bifurcation (Schroeder; Hieronymi)  \nOthers preserve the autonomy of each kind by positing two distinct normative domains: an epistemic ought and a practical ought, with no single, overarching ought. Belief is then subject to what Mark Schroeder calls \u201cdomain-relativized\u201d norms. The incommensurability problem is sidestepped: there is nothing that needs to weigh them together. But the cost is fragmentation. Practical deliberation typically aims at a single choice. We want to know whether, all told, I may believe the comforting but poorly supported prognosis. Bifurcation denies the very question.\n\n4.3 Encroachment (Stanley, Fantl & McGrath, Moss)  \nOn pragmatic encroachment accounts, practical factors can affect whether I know or whether I am justified by altering the epistemic threshold. High stakes raise the bar for \u201csufficient justification.\u201d This elegantly explains why evidence alone is sometimes not enough. But the mechanism only runs one way: practical stakes influence the epistemic status, never vice-versa. And it still presupposes lexical priority: once stakes have fixed the threshold, only evidence determines whether the threshold is met.\n\n5. The Policy Model\n\n5.1 The Core Insight  \nBelief is not precisely an action, but adopting or foregoing a belief can be modeled as choosing a policy. A policy is a mapping from evidence states to doxastic attitudes. When I deliberate about a single belief at a time, policies collapse to three options: Believe p, Disbelieve p, or Suspend judgment. Each policy yields payoffs along two dimensions:\n  \u2022 Accuracy payoff: 1 if the attitude matches the world, 0 otherwise.  \n  \u2022 Practical payoff: Depend on consequences in the agent\u2019s specific context.\n\nExpected utility theory already gives us a way to combine probability (supplied by my evidence) with utility (supplied by my value function). If belief policies can be assessed by expected total payoff\u2014which is just weighted accuracy + weighted practical stakes\u2014then the all-things-considered ought reduces to: choose the policy with maximal expected value.\n\n5.2 Why This Avoids Incommensurability  \nCrucially, there is no need to measure \u201ctruth\u201d and \u201cvalue\u201d on a single scale. Truth affects expected value by way of probability. Value affects expected value by way of utility. The mathematics of expectation supplies the commensuration. Epistemic reasons enter solely through their influence on the agent\u2019s credence in p; practical reasons enter solely through the utilities associated with holding or withholding p in each possible world.\n\n5.3 Illustrative Case: Pascal\u2019s Wager Rehabilitated  \nPascal argued that the infinite utility of heaven swamps any finite evidential probability of God\u2019s existence; hence one ought to believe in God. Critics say belief is not under voluntary control and anyway epistemic integrity forbids willful divergence from evidence. The Policy Model refines Pascal: what the rational agent ought to adopt is a \u201cpro-theistic believing policy,\u201d i.e. cultivate a context in which belief in God will form if not positively blocked by overwhelming counterevidence (prayer, church attendance, etc.). Expected value theory shows how a tiny probability gets multiplied by infinity, yielding comparative dominance. One may reject infinite utilities or accept low but non-zero probability. Either way, the framework explains how epistemic probability and utility interact without needing them to be inter-translatable.\n\n5.4 Clifford\u2019s Shipowner  \nClifford chastises the owner who believes the ship safe on scant inspection because it was costly to refit. Our model concurs: practical utility favored believing the ship was safe, but expected loss if the ship sinks dominates, so the policy with highest expected value is to suspend belief until proper evidence is obtained. Again, epistemic probabilities and moral utilities interact seamlessly.\n\n5.5 Moral Encroachment  \nSuppose I am told, \u201cThere is a 70 % chance person X is a terrorist because of demographic profiling.\u201d The high moral disvalue of a false positive (wrongful arrest) may require a much higher posterior probability before I form the belief \u201cX is a terrorist.\u201d The Policy Model derives this: raise the decision threshold because the utility profile is asymmetric.\n\n5.6 How the Model Respects the Autonomy of Evidence  \nNote that evidence sets probabilities; utilities cannot make p more or less likely. What they can do is alter which policy maximizes expected value. Hence we retain the independence of truth-conducive reasons: they fix the credence input. Practical reasons operate solely on the output side.\n\n6. Reply to the Voluntarism Objection\n\nBeliefs are not directly voluntary, so how can a decision rule apply? Two replies.\n\n6.1 Indirect Control  \nWhile I cannot at will raise my credence in p from .3 to .9, I can adopt indirect control measures\u2014seek further evidence, avoid biased environments, engage in wishful thinking, or refrain from entertaining doubt. These policies predictably influence future credence. The relevant \u201cacts\u201d are thus policies or cognitive efforts, not instantaneous belief choices.\n\n6.2 Guidance Condition  \nNorms can guide even if exact compliance is not in immediate control. Moral norms guide behavior despite akrasia; epistemic-practical norms guide cognitive policy despite involuntariness.\n\n7. Reply to the Integrity Objection\n\nIt may seem dishonest to treat belief as an instrument. Kantians argue that believing against evidence violates a duty to oneself. The Policy Model need not endorse Baldwinian wishful thinking. Often, expected-value maximization chooses the evidentially best policy; only in rare edge cases will high stakes license divergence. Even then, the policy might require suspension, not outright belief. Moreover, integrity is itself a practical consideration with utility value; if we weight intellectual honesty highly, the model will penalize policies that flout it.\n\n8. Epistemic Lexical Priority Revisited\n\nOne might still hold that truth has lexical priority: any non-truth consideration is nil unless two policies are equal in truth-expectation. The Policy Model can incorporate this by assigning a utility margin that dwarfs all practical utilities. The framework is neutral on whether agents in fact adopt such extreme utility schedules. Thus traditional evidentialism emerges as a special case, not a rival.\n\n9. Reconciling with Encroachment\n\nNotice that the Policy Model predicts the main results of pragmatic encroachment. In high-stakes contexts the expected disutility of error is large, so one should set a higher evidential threshold before believing. That is exactly encroachment. The difference is that we derive the effect from a deeper decision-theoretic principle rather than building it in at the level of knowledge or justification.\n\n10. Conclusion\n\nThe alleged incommensurability of epistemic and practical reasons rests on an overly constricted picture of belief and an implicit assumption about lexical ordering. Once belief policies are modeled as acts under risk, standard tools of rational choice theory supply a single metric\u2014expected value\u2014that makes commensuration not only possible but inevitable. Evidence fixes probabilities; stakes fix utilities; the \u201cought, all things considered\u201d is to adopt the doxastic policy with maximal expected value.\n\nThis is not reduction: truth remains truth. Nor is it bifurcation: we deliver an all-things-considered guidance. Nor does it deny pragmatic encroachment: it explains it. The framework therefore preserves the autonomy of both epistemic and practical reasons while providing a principled mechanism by which they interact. Far from being incommensurable, the two kinds of reasons turn out to be complementary inputs into a unified normative calculus that governs rational belief-policy.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 6, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 2902, "reasoning_tokens": 320}
{"question_id": "Maguire-GameBelief-2020", "question": "Some philosophers argue that there are both epistemic reasons (evidence-based) and practical reasons (concerning usefulness, harm, or moral considerations) that bear on what we ought to believe. However, these two types of reasons seem fundamentally different in kind\u2014epistemic reasons concern truth-conduciveness while practical reasons concern value or welfare. If both types of reasons genuinely bear on belief, how can they possibly interact to determine what one ought to believe, given that they seem incommensurable and thus impossible to weigh against each other directly?", "answer": "                                                     Epistemic and Practical Reasons for Belief:\n                                               Commensurability, Conflict, and Normative Governance\n\n\n\n1. Framing the Puzzle  \n\nMost of us think that the beliefs we ought to have are the ones that, given our evidence, are most likely to be true.  At the same time, we also judge some beliefs by their effects: the cancer patient who refuses to believe she can recover, the parent who embraces an optimistic view of a child\u2019s prospects, or the extremist whose bigoted creed causes harm.  These latter assessments invoke practical considerations\u2014moral, prudential, or political\u2014about the consequences of believing.  The puzzle, noted since Pascal and William James and recently revived by debates over \u201cpragmatic\u201d and \u201cmoral\u201d encroachment, is that epistemic and practical reasons appear to be of radically different kinds.  Epistemic reasons track truth; practical reasons track value.  If neither reduces to the other, how could they interact so as to yield a single verdict on what one, all things considered, ought to believe?  Are we forced to admit an incommensurable stalemate, or can a unified normative picture be given?\n\n\n\n2. Why \u201cIncommensurable\u201d Sounds Plausible  \n\nThe charge of incommensurability rests on two ideas.\n\na. Different evaluative dimensions.  Epistemic rationality appraises belief with respect to an aim\u2014accuracy\u2014that is constitutive of belief itself.  In Gilbert Harman\u2019s slogan, \u201cThe purpose of the assessment is prediction, explanation, retrodiction.\u201d  Practical rationality, by contrast, appraises belief instrumentally, by the further ends it serves\u2014comfort, safety, justice.  Value and truth appear to inhabit separate normative spaces.\n\nb. Lack of a common metric.  To weigh reasons against each other we need them to be comparable along a shared scale.  But how would a 0.7 posterior probability within one\u2019s Bayesian net be converted into so many units of moral disvalue?  Apples and oranges.\n\nThe conclusion many draw is a \u201ctwo oughts\u201d view: there is an epistemic ought and a practical ought, neither trumping nor summing with the other; when they diverge, conflict is merely apparent because it involves different normative domains.  The problem with retreating to plural \u2018oughts\u2019, however, is that ordinary deliberation about what to believe does not bifurcate so neatly.  I wonder whether to forgive a friend\u2019s betrayal; I weigh the scant evidence that she is contrite together with the value of restoring the friendship.  The deliberation delivers a single verdict\u2014believe or withhold.  Our practices presuppose some way of integrating the two kinds of consideration in one decision.\n\n\n\n3. Four Familiar Strategies and Their Limits  \n\nBefore offering a positive proposal, it is instructive to canvass four gambits that attempt to dissolve, rather than solve, the problem.\n\n(1) Pure Evidentialism.  Wilfrid Sellars, Richard Feldman, and Earl Conee contend that practical considerations are never genuine reasons for belief, though they may be motives.  The patient may have cause to try to generate optimism, but that is a reason to manipulate evidence-gathering, not to believe without evidence.  This view preserves purity at the cost of ignoring wide-spread intuitive judgments\u2014James\u2019s alpine leap, Pascal\u2019s wager, contemporary cases of high-stakes knowledge\u2014that seem to show practical stakes directly bearing on epistemic propriety.\n\n(2) Pragmatism-as-Reduction.  A second strategy, advanced by pragmatic encroachment theorists such as Jeremy Fantl, Matthew McGrath, and Jason Stanley, claims that when the practical stakes rise, the epistemic threshold for belief or knowledge shifts.  Practical features affect whether p counts as knowledge, but do so by altering the amount of evidence one needs, not by supplying an independent kind of reason.  Objection: this works only if practical reasons always act indirectly, by changing evidential standards.  Yet moral encroachment examples (e.g., racial generalizations that are statistically well-confirmed but morally pernicious) suggest that sometimes we have decisive moral reason not to believe even when the evidence is robust.\n\n(3) Lexical Priority.  Some, like James Pryor for the epistemic side or Jonathan Way for the practical side, argue that one domain lexically trumps the other: satisfy the higher-order norm first; only when that leaves leeway may the lower-order domain speak.  Clifford\u2019s famous maxim \u201cIt is wrong always, everywhere, and for anyone, to believe anything upon insufficient evidence\u201d exemplifies absolute epistemic priority.  The cost is that lexical order seems arbitrary.  Why privilege truth over, say, preventing grievous harm?  And real cases suggest that either domain can sometimes override the other.\n\n(4) Replacing Belief with Action.  A final maneuver is to deny that there is any unified \u2018ought\u2019 governing belief at all; the proper site of integration is choice, not doxastic attitude.  Believe as the evidence says, then decide what to do given that belief.  But forming and withholding belief are themselves actions (or at least voluntary up to a point), and many decisions\u2014whom to trust, how to allocate attention\u2014require settling on a belief to proceed.  The question about belief does not go away.\n\nEach strategy, then, leaves something to be desired.  We need an account that (i) treats both kinds of reasons as genuine, (ii) explains how they can be compared, without (iii) trivializing either, and (iv) yields sensible verdicts in hard cases.\n\n\n\n4. A Dual-Ranking Model of Doxastic Normativity  \n\nMy proposal borrows from work on value pluralism and decision theory, melding ideas from Susan Hurley\u2019s \u201ctwo-tier\u201d models, John Broome\u2019s \u2018normative requirements\u2019, and Lara Buchak\u2019s risk-weighted expected utility.  The core thought is simple:\n\nStep 1:  There are two independent rankings of belief options\u2014an epistemic ranking E and a practical ranking P.  These are incommensurable in the sense that neither can be reduced to the other.\n\nStep 2:  Agents are subject to a higher-order rational demand to adopt a belief that is non-dominated across the two rankings.  Belief A strictly dominates belief B if A is at least as good as B on both E and P, and better on one.  This dominance rule is familiar from choice theory and does not presuppose a common unit of measurement; it merely looks for Pareto-inferiority.\n\nStep 3:  When options remain incomparable (neither dominates), a second-order aggregation rule is triggered.  The most plausible such rule, I argue, is risk-weighted lexicographic ordering: set a minimal epistemic threshold (we might call it the Truth Constraint) that no belief may fall below; among beliefs meeting that threshold, select the one that maximizes practical value.\n\nLet us unpack and motivate each step.\n\n\n\n4.1 Independent Rankings  \n\nThe E-ranking is generated by truth-conduciveness: in Bayesian terms, by the posterior probability of p given one\u2019s total evidence.  The P-ranking is generated by the expected value of holding the belief\u2014factoring in instrumental benefits, moral considerations, identity-forming roles, etc.  Importantly, we do not need cardinal numbers.  All we need is an ordinal ranking induced by \u2018better conducive to truth\u2019 and \u2018better conducive to value.\u2019\n\nBecause these orderings are constructed within distinct domains, they do not compete for the same scale; they resemble maps using different coordinate systems.  That kisses goodbye to the demand for a single ruler.  All that matters is how options line up within each dimension.\n\n\n\n4.2 Dominance as a Non-Comparative Filter  \n\nSuppose believing p is worse epistemically than withholding (its probability is 0.4, withholding has expected accuracy of 1), and also worse practically (adopting p would encourage reckless behavior).  Believing p is then dominated; no rational agent may choose it.  The dominance filter is silent where trade-offs arise\u2014if believing p is epistemically better but practically worse, both survive to the next stage.  Thus we already secure partial interaction without a common metric.\n\nNote, too, that the dominance principle is independently normatively compelling: ignoring a strictly dominated option is a minimal requirement of rationality whether one is buying apples or forming beliefs.\n\n\n\n4.3 The Truth Constraint and Residual Choice  \n\nAfter dominated options are removed, there may remain a frontier of non-dominated options.  Now true incommensurability bites.  How to pick?  My suggestion is that there exists an epistemic threshold T representing the seriousness of belief\u2019s aim at truth.  We can think of T as the level of credence above which an attitude counts as a permissible belief.  Philosophers differ about where to set T\u201450%, 0.8, knowledge, justification\u2014but nothing in the framework hinges on a precise number.  What matters is that crossing T is a prerequisite for an attitude to qualify as belief, not merely suspended judgment.  This threshold operationalizes the thought that there is a constitutive connection between belief and truth: to count as rationally believing p at all, one must regard p as surpassing T.\n\nWithin the class of attitudes that meet the Truth Constraint, further selection is governed by practical ranking.  This is where the moral or prudential dimension enters decisively.  Suppose the evidence supports either believing p (credence .9) or believing q (credence .91); both exceed T.  If believing p will save a life while believing q is inert, P dictates believing p.  Where the stakes are reversed, believe q.\n\nWhy not simply maximize P from the start?  Because the Truth Constraint acknowledges epistemic authority; it forbids sacrificing too much accuracy for gain.  Conversely, why not lexically prioritize evidence?  Because the threshold, unlike absolute lexicographic supremacy, allows practical reasons a real role: once the truth-aim is secured to a sufficient degree, value considerations legitimately sway the outcome.\n\n\n\n5. Testing the Model  \n\nLet us run the proposal through five canonical kinds of case.\n\na. Clifford\u2019s Shipowner.  The shipowner has weak evidence that his vessel is seaworthy; economic gain tempts him to believe it is.  E says withhold or disbelieve; the belief is far below T.  The option is dominated epistemically; the filter tosses it.  Verdict: he ought not believe, matching our intuitions.\n\nb. Pascal\u2019s Wager.  Evidence for God\u2019s existence is (let us concede) modest, but above threshold?  Many would say no; 0.2 credence is short of T.  The belief is excluded.  But suppose one is in a Jamesian \u201cforced live moment\u201d with evidence hovering at 0.6.  Then both believing and withholding pass E.  Practical benefits (infinite expected utility) may tilt P sharply toward belief.  Verdict: belief is permitted and maybe required, reproducing James\u2019s view that practical stakes can justifiably settle an evidentially underdetermined decision.\n\nc. The Racist Statistician.  Statistical evidence strongly supports believing that a random member of Group X will not repay a loan.  Moral reasons warning against pernicious stereotyping loom large.  Here believing plays much better on E (.9) than withholding (.5).  Does P supply a reason strong enough to forbid belief?  On my model moral disvalue can defeat epistemic superiority only if E superiority does not cross threshold T by too much.  If T is 0.8, .9 vs .5 both exceed T, so practical reasons decide.  The model predicts it is wrong to believe the stereotype, aligning with Basu and McGowan\u2019s moral encroachment.\n\nd. Low-Stakes Lottery.  Evidence that ticket 812 won is under 0.001.  T might be set so high that withholding is mandated.  Practical reasons favor not caring either way, hence also withholding.  No tension.\n\ne. Self-Fulfillment Beliefs.  Studies suggest that students who believe they can succeed often do succeed.  Evidence that I will ace the test is middling; but believing it would raise odds.  Again, if credence crosses T, practical reasons tip the scale; if not, they cannot.  The model yields caution for the utterly unprepared but endorsement for the well-prepared who only need confidence.\n\nThese results are not forced; they depend on parameter choices (T, rankings).  But they show that once the architecture is in place, seemingly messy phenomena fall into place without positing mysterious commensuration.\n\n\n\n6. Addressing Objections  \n\nObjection 1: Thresholds are arbitrary.  Reply: Many norms employ thresholds\u2014legal proof \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d, prudential safety margins, the medical \u201cstandard of care.\u201d  They reflect the inevitability of vague but action-guiding cut-offs in normative life.  Philosophers need tolerate no Archimedean point; vagueness is not vice.\n\nObjection 2: The model implies that belief is voluntary.  Not quite.  It presupposes only that agents can regulate belief-forming processes, not that they can directly will belief.  Dominance and threshold norms can guide attention, evidence-collection, self-exposure to arguments, all of which shape what one comes to believe.\n\nObjection 3: Risk of self-deception.  Won\u2019t agents fudge E to suit P?  Rational requirements are often susceptible to bad-faith manipulation, yet we do not discard them.  Moreover, the dual-ranking framework allows for second-order norms policing evidence evaluation; self-deception violates those norms.\n\nObjection 4: Doesn\u2019t the Truth Constraint smuggle lexical priority back in?  Not if T is below certainty.  Epistemic reasons merely set a floor; practical reasons may still overturn the epistemically best option so long as the floor is met.  Contrast Clifford\u2019s absolute prohibition.\n\n\n\n7. Broader Theoretical Payoffs  \n\nThe proposal vindicates several independently attractive theses.\n\n\u2022 Normative pluralism: there are irreducible kinds of reasons.  \n\n\u2022 Anti-particularism: yet integration proceeds by general principles\u2014dominance, threshold, value-maximization\u2014resisting skeptical worries about ad hoc balancing.\n\n\u2022 Pragmatic and moral encroachment: the stakes affect what one ought to believe, but without deflating the distinctive character of epistemic normativity.\n\n\u2022 Compatibility with knowledge norms: on many theories S knows that p only if S\u2019s belief meets a high credence threshold; my model dovetails if we let knowledge require credence > K > T.\n\n\n\n8. Comparability without Currency  \n\nWhy, finally, is the dominance-threshold architecture philosophically satisfying?  Because it shows that the demand for a common currency is an illusion.  Consider two job candidates, one stronger academically, the other better at outreach.  A hiring committee can sensibly filter any candidate strictly worse on both dimensions; it may then look for minimal academic competence before letting outreach tip the scale.  No single \u201cunits\u201d of merit are needed.  Our model transposes this familiar practical reasoning into doxastic space.  Epistemic and practical reasons interact not by measuring truth and value on one ruler, but by structuring the space of options and imposing rational constraints on admissible moves within that space.\n\n\n\n9. Where Next?  \n\nThe account invites refinement.  What fixes the threshold\u2014convention, constitutive aim, evolutionary utility?  Do some practical reasons, like moral reasons not to harm, deserve partial lexical superiority?  How do higher-order epistemic goods, such as understanding, fit?  I have not offered final answers.  But I hope to have shown that the specter of incommensurability is not fatal.  Rational believers can honor both the love of truth and the demands of value through a pair of complementary mechanisms: minimal fidelity to evidence and responsible responsiveness to stakes.\n\n\n\n10. Conclusion  \n\nWe began with a dilemma: either deny practical reasons any role in belief, or embrace an intractable clash of incomparables.  The dual-ranking model dissolves the dilemma by recognizing two genuine but autonomous normative dimensions, orchestrated by higher-order principles\u2014dominance and threshold\u2014that do not require conversion to a common metric.  Far from being alien to everyday cognition, this structure mirrors patterns of decision-making we effortlessly employ elsewhere.  The philosopher\u2019s task is to render such patterns explicit.  When we do, we see that believing well is neither a matter of cold evidence alone nor a matter of expedient wish-fulfillment, but an exercise in the integrated governance of rational agency.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 7, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 3951, "reasoning_tokens": 448}

Setting the Problem  \n\nWhen I decide whether to believe that the bridge ahead is safe, two quite different sorts of considerations seem to matter.  \n\u2022 Epistemic: the engineering report says the bridge was inspected yesterday; the pillars look sound; there is no evidence of recent earthquakes.  \n\u2022 Practical: if I believe it unsafe I will cancel the ambulance crossing and a patient may die; if I falsely believe it safe and it collapses the public will be harmed.\n\nThe first set concerns the truth of the proposition; the second concerns prudential and moral stakes. Many philosophers\u2014James, Pascal, contemporary \u201cpragmatic encroachers,\u201d and \u201cpractical reasons\u201d theorists such as Reisner, Weatherson, Rinard\u2014hold that both sorts of consideration can supply genuine reasons for or against belief.  The difficulty is that the reasons differ in kind.  Truth-conduciveness and value-promotion are, on their face, measured on distinct scales and obey different standards of success.  How, then, could they cooperate\u2014or compete\u2014in fixing what I \u201cought, simpliciter,\u201d to believe?  Must we translate value into probability, or probability into value?  Or must we deny that they interact at all, partitioning doxastic normativity into autonomous realms?  Either route seems costly: the first threatens to distort one of the two domains; the second leaves us with two incompatible oughts and no verdict on what to do when they conflict.\n\nI shall argue that the dilemma is ill-posed.  Once we examine (i) the nature of doxastic agency, (ii) the structure of practical deliberation, and (iii) the constitutive aim of belief, we can vindicate a model on which epistemic reasons enjoy lexical priority within belief-formation, yet practical reasons can nevertheless \u201center the equation\u201d in three distinctive ways: by modulating the threshold for epistemic sufficiency, by generating higher-order defeat, and by licensing the substitution of non-doxastic cognitive attitudes that serve practical ends without corrupting belief proper.  These interaction mechanisms do not require direct commensuration of truth and value; instead they exploit the hierarchical architecture of rational agency.  In short, epistemic and practical norms are not homogeneous coins to be placed on the same scale; they occupy different levels of regulation, and once this is seen, their joint governance is intelligible.\n\n2. Four Models of Interaction and Their Problems  \n\nBefore presenting the hybrid account, it is helpful to survey the leading extant proposals.\n\n2.1 Reductionist Common-Currency  \n\nOne might try to measure both epistemic and practical considerations on a single utility-metric: e.g. expected value, where expected moral utility = probability \u00d7 value.  Belief is then rational when it maximizes expected value.  However, this collapses belief into action.  The distinctive feature of belief\u2014its aim at truth and its involuntariness under direct will\u2014drops out, and Clifford\u2019s worry resurfaces: if high stakes can always swamp low probability, we license wishful or superstitious believing.  Epistemic reasons lose their independent normative bite.\n\n2.2 Lexical Priority of the Epistemic  \n\nThe opposite extreme, defended by Shah & Velleman and by Owens, assigns absolute priority to epistemic reasons: practical considerations may guide what inquiries we undertake, but once sufficient evidence is on the table, only truth-related considerations govern belief.  This protects the integrity of epistemic normativity but at the cost of ignoring compelling intuitive cases\u2014the desperate mother who, facing no contrary evidence, finds it permissible to believe her child still lives; or James\u2019s \u201cforced live option\u201d of believing a friend trustworthy to make the friendship possible.  Moreover, the view cannot straightforwardly accommodate pragmatic encroachment data suggesting that identical evidence may or may not suffice for knowledge depending on what is at stake.\n\n2.3 All-Things-Considered Scalar Weighing  \n\nA more ecumenical idea (Reisner 2009) postulates an undefined master-scale of reason-strength on which epistemic and practical inputs can, after all, be compared, though we lack an explicit conversion rate.  The worry here is metaphysical: what could ground such mysterious commensurability?  Absent a story, the account is merely promissory.\n\n2.4 Bifurcation: Distinct Oughts  \n\nFinally, we might accept two incommensurable oughts: an epistemic oughtE and a practical oughtP, each delivering its own verdict.  The agent is left with a fractured directive: \u201cYou oughtE to believe p, yet you oughtP to refrain.\u201d  This respects incommensurability but abandons practical guidance.  If normativity is action-guiding, it should finally tell us what to do, not merely issue compartmentalized scores.\n\n3. Toward a Hierarchical, Non-Commensurative Model  \n\nThe impasse stems from a tacit assumption: that reasons interact only by being summed or balanced on a single dimension.  But rational agency is structurally layered.  Beliefs rationalize actions; intentions govern subordinate plans; constraints operate at some levels but not others.  We should therefore expect different kinds of reasons to occupy different rungs of the ladder.\n\nKey idea: Epistemic reasons set the constitutive standard for the attitude of belief itself.  Practical reasons operate one level up: they supply considerations about which *attitudes* to adopt or sustain subject to epistemic constraints, or about whether to seek further evidence, or about whether to shift to a neighboring attitude (acceptance, assumption, suspension) that serves one\u2019s ends without violating the belief norm.  Once the vertical differentiation is recognized, \u201cinteraction\u201d no longer requires cardinal comparison; it occurs via rule-governed interfaces between levels.\n\n4. The Constitutive Aim of Belief and Lexical Priority  \n\nFollowing Davidson and Velleman, let us grant that belief constitutively aims at truth.  To count as the attitude it is, belief must be regulated by a norm of evidence-responsiveness.  This endows epistemic reasons with lexical priority *within* the activity of belief-formation: if a consideration does not bear on truth, it cannot directly justify believing.  Practical desiderata, therefore, cannot simply override counter-evidence; that would destroy the attitude\u2019s identity, producing self-deceived make-believe.\n\nYet lexical priority is not absolutism.  It governs only *direct* justification for *that* attitude.  There remain three indirect routes by which practical concerns can rationally influence what we believe.\n\n5. Mechanism I: Stakes-Sensitive Sufficiency  \n\nThough belief aims at truth, there is no fixed probability threshold at which evidence compels assent.  Human cognitive resources are finite; costly errors matter more in some contexts than others.  The epistemic norm is plausibly *satisficing*: believe when the evidence is \u201cgood enough.\u201d  But \u201cgood enough\u201d is partly determined by what counts as an unacceptable error\u2014an assessment that is practical.  High-stakes cases (crossing the minefield) demand more evidence for the same proposition than low-stakes cases (which side of the river is deeper where no swimming is required).  This is the core of pragmatic encroachment (Fantl & McGrath, Stanley).  Importantly, practical considerations do not enter as reasons *against* believing; they raise the defeasibility bar for epistemic adequacy itself.  No commensuration is needed; value shapes the standard, truth remains the aim.\n\n6. Mechanism II: Higher-Order Defeat  \n\nA second interface exploits the fact that we can have beliefs *about* our doxastic states\u2014beliefs about whether our evidence is decisive, about our cognitive reliability under pressure, etc.  Practical reasons can supply higher-order defeaters: \u201cGiven the grave consequences of error, I cannot trust my snap judgment; so even though p seems true, I ought to suspend.\u201d  Again the immediate normative verdict (believe vs. suspend) turns on *epistemic* assessment\u2014whether my total evidence, including evidence of my unreliability, warrants belief.  The practical consideration enters by generating new evidence (of unreliability or of unusual incentive to self-deception), not by outweighing truth considerations.\n\n7. Mechanism III: Attitude Substitution and Double-Bookkeeping  \n\nFinally, where practical reasons decisively favor treating p as true although evidence is middling, agents possess a repertoire of *non-doxastic* cognitive attitudes\u2014acceptance for the sake of action, presumption, faith, imaginative supposition.  These attitudes are under direct voluntary control and answer primarily to practical reasons.  One may rationally *accept* that the medicine will work in order to maintain hope, while epistemically suspending belief about its efficacy.  Thus the agent does not violate the constitutive aim of belief, yet still integrates practical reasons into her cognitive economy.\n\nThis double-bookkeeping is not schizophrenia.  Distinct attitudes have distinct functional roles: belief guides theoretical inference and prediction; acceptance guides immediate action where costs of doubt are high.  Because folk psychology recognizes only one label\u2014\u201cbelieve\u201d\u2014philosophers sometimes shrink from this multiplicity.  But scientific practice (working hypotheses), legal practice (presumption of innocence), and everyday life (promising to meet a friend) rely on it constantly.\n\n8. Objections and Replies  \n\nObjection 1. The model makes practical reasons derivative, never genuine reasons for belief.  Reply: they are genuine, but conditional.  They tell us: \u201cForm an attitude that will help you achieve your ends *unless doing so violates the constitutive norm of belief*.\u201d  Because belief\u2019s identity already embeds that norm, the conditional becomes effective only via the three mechanisms described.  This still counts as practical governance of doxastic life.\n\nObjection 2. The view leaves no room for Jamesian will-to-believe cases where pragmatic benefits license belief despite evidential equilibrium.  Reply: genuine evidential *equilibrium* rarely exists; typical cases are ones of evidential insufficiency.  Mechanism I shows how pragmatic stakes can tip the scale by making moderate evidence sufficient.  Moreover, some Jamesian projects (religious faith, trust in friendship) are better modeled as voluntary acceptance or commitment, not belief in the evidentialist sense.\n\nObjection 3. The account is paternalistic: it forbids victims or the dying from believing comforting propositions lacking evidence.  Reply: the view allows acceptance, imagination, and hope.  If people insist that they \u201cbelieve\u201d the comforting proposition, we should understand them as employing an attitude with the surface grammar of belief but the functional role of hope.  Philosophical clarity, not cruelty, recommends the distinction.\n\nObjection 4. Hierarchical interaction is ad hoc; why think rational architecture has levels?  Answer: general action theory supports it.  Decision-making is routinely staged: practical reason decides *which tasks to undertake,* then sub-processes execute those tasks subject to internal norms.  Cooking aims at edibility; but once I decide to cook, knife-handling is evaluated by a safety norm that is lexically prior within that sub-activity.  Belief, I claim, is a sub-activity of cognition with its own constitutive telos.\n\n9. Comparison with Competitors  \n\nThe hybrid model retains the intuitions motivating each rival:\n\na) Like reductionism, it lets very high stakes make a difference.  \nb) Like evidentialist lexical priority, it forbids wishful thinking that flouts evidence.  \nc) Unlike all-things-considered scalarism, it does not posit mysterious metaphysical currency.  \nd) Unlike strict bifurcation, it offers concrete guidance: sometimes search for more evidence, sometimes suspend, sometimes adopt a proxy attitude.\n\nIt does, of course, deny that there is a single all-things-considered *belief*-directive.  The imperative is conditional: *Given your practical situation, decide which cognitive attitude to adopt; if that attitude is belief, then defer exclusively to epistemic reason.*  Guidance is preserved, even if it requires two steps.\n\n10. Implications for Epistemology and Ethics  \n\na) Epistemic Justification.  Justification remains truth-aimed but context-sensitive.  Stakes modulate thresholds for reasonable belief, explaining pragmatic encroachment without collapsing into pragmatism.\n\nb) Moral Encroachment.  Recent work (Basu, Schroeder) on racist belief illustrates how high moral stakes can make evidence insufficient to justify statistical stereotyping.  Mechanism I provides the theoretical underpinning: potential harm raises the stakes, ratcheting up the evidential standard.\n\nc) Doctrinal Faith.  Religious and political commitment can be accommodated as acceptance/faith attitudes rather than literal belief, circumventing evidence-based objections while acknowledging the practical centrality of these outlooks.\n\nd) Education and Inquiry.  Teaching critical thinking involves clarifying attitude taxonomy: distinguishing belief from assumption equips students to navigate practical pressures without compromising intellectual honesty.\n\n11. Conclusion  \n\nWe began with an apparent impasse: epistemic and practical reasons seem incommensurable, yet both intuitively matter to what we ought to believe.  The stalemate dissolves once we realize that \u201cought to believe\u201d is shorthand for a two-stage prescription: (1) Choose, on practical grounds, which doxastic-like attitude it is appropriate to adopt toward p. (2) If the attitude chosen is belief, respect its constitutive epistemic norm.  Practical reasons influence Step 1 directly and Step 2 indirectly via stakes-sensitive sufficiency and higher-order defeat; epistemic reasons govern Step 2\u2019s internal operation.  Because the reasons address different questions, no common scale is required; interaction occurs through hierarchical embedding, not arithmetical weighing.\n\nThus the spectre of incommensurability is tamed.  Truth and value can jointly regulate our cognitive lives, each in its proper place, without compromising the other\u2019s integrity.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 8, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 3290, "reasoning_tokens": 320}
{"question_id": "Maguire-GameBelief-2020", "question": "Some philosophers argue that there are both epistemic reasons (evidence-based) and practical reasons (concerning usefulness, harm, or moral considerations) that bear on what we ought to believe. However, these two types of reasons seem fundamentally different in kind\u2014epistemic reasons concern truth-conduciveness while practical reasons concern value or welfare. If both types of reasons genuinely bear on belief, how can they possibly interact to determine what one ought to believe, given that they seem incommensurable and thus impossible to weigh against each other directly?", "answer": "Epistemic versus Practical Reasons: Can They Be Weighed Together?\n\n1. Introduction\n\nBelief seems an essentially truth-aimed state. Yet our lives are awash with situations in which what is useful, moral, or identity-defining apparently pushes against, or pulls in tandem with, what our evidence indicates. Pascal urges us to believe in God for eternal reward; William James thinks it permissible \u201cto will to believe\u201d when the \u201cintellect cannot decide\u201d; doctors sometimes reassure dying patients with optimistic prognoses they do not fully credit; activists sustain hope that statistics do not yet warrant. These examples suggest that practical considerations do, at least sometimes, bear on what we ought to believe. But if there are genuinely two kinds of reasons\u2014epistemic (truth-conducive) and practical (value-conducive)\u2014how can they interact, given that they appear to employ different evaluative currencies? This essay defends a conciliatory model on which epistemic and practical reasons are neither collapsed into one another nor sealed off in separate normative silos. They interact through higher-order norms governing the agency of believers\u2014norms of intellectual conduct that, precisely because they are agent-focused, can register both truth and value. I call the view \u201cReason Integrationism.\u201d After clarifying the challenge (\u00a72), I criticize two tempting but unsatisfactory responses: reduction (\u00a73) and isolation (\u00a74). I then articulate the integrationist proposal (\u00a75), develop its machinery (\u00a76-\u00a78), and reply to objections (\u00a79). I conclude by sketching implications for broader epistemology (\u00a710).\n\n2. Stating the Incommensurability Worry\n\nEpistemic reasons (ERs) appear to be reasons of the right kind for belief: they bear directly on the question \u201cIs p true?\u201d\u2014roughly, they consist in evidence, reliability markers, explanatory power, coherence, etc. Practical reasons (PRs) do something different: they track the desirability of believing p\u2014expected utility, moral utility, psychological comfort, social harmony. The alleged incommensurability arises because ERs and PRs answer formally distinct questions: ERs answer \u201cIs p likely true?\u201d; PRs answer \u201cWhat is it good, useful, or right for me to believe?\u201d The first question traffics in alethic value; the second in pragmatic or moral value. If two standards differ in their value dimension, how can they be compared, let alone summed in an \u201call-things-considered\u201d ought?\n\n3. Reductionist Escape: Collapse PRs into ERs (or Vice Versa)\n\nOne way out is to deny dualism. \u201cPragmatic encroachers\u201d sometimes hint that practical stakes affect what counts as knowledge because they modulate the epistemic threshold\u2014evidence required for warranted belief rises when the cost of error is high (Fantl & McGrath; Stanley). But this maneuver either (a) reduces PRs to ERs by baking utility into the very standard of evidence (and thereby loses the distinction), or (b) equivocates: saying that higher stakes alter the level of epistemic justification only shows that PRs affect the circumstances under which an ER obtains, not that PRs themselves are ERs. Similarly, Alston (1988) tries to construe ERs as Long-Run Truth Rate Maximizers, effectively smuggling prudential considerations into the epistemic goal. Yet then epistemology becomes decision theory in disguise, and we no longer have a genuinely truth-aimed norm. These reductions, while intellectually neat, distort paradigmatic cases. A terminally ill patient\u2019s wish to believe she will recover is not, and need not masquerade as, evidence of recovery. So reductionism fails.\n\n4. Isolationist Escape: Dual Oughts that Never Meet\n\nAlternatively, one might accept two independent \u201coughts\u201d: an epistemic ought (ought_E) governed solely by ERs and a practical ought (ought_P) governed solely by PRs. We never face the impossible task of weighing them; we merely acknowledge plural, domain-specific verdicts. On pressures for belief, Clifford\u2019s strict evidentialism issues \u201cought_E: do not believe without sufficient evidence,\u201d while James\u2019s permissivism issues \u201ccan_P: it is humanly permissible to believe in certain forced, momentous, living options absent decisive evidence.\u201d Each \u201cought\u201d stands on its own; there is no single all-things-considered (ATC) ought. This picture respects distinct reason kinds, but at the cost of furnishing agents with conflicting normative directives and no guidance on which to follow when they clash. It also misdescribes sincere deliberation: one typically asks, not \u201cWhat ought I do epistemically?\u201d and \u201cWhat ought I do practically?\u201d but \u201cAll things considered, what should I believe?\u201d Isolationism therefore sacrifices normative guidance for tidy taxonomies.\n\n5. Toward Reason Integrationism\n\nReason Integrationism keeps the dualism of kinds but supplies a common deliberative forum. The key idea is that, although ERs and PRs differ in their base values (truth vs. utility/morality), deliberating believers are agents subject to higher-order norms that care about more than one value at once. These higher-order norms are agential: they evaluate a believer\u2019s intellectual conduct by reference to overall rational integrity or \u201cresponsible believing.\u201d Because the norm\u2019s evaluative perspective is agential rather than strictly epistemic, it can weigh both truth and practical desirability, even if the currencies at first look disparate.\n\nAnalogy: Suppose a physician faces a treatment choice between Drug A (higher cure rate but severe side effects) and Drug B (lower cure rate but minimal side effects). The physician weighs probabilities of cure (health-value) against quality of life (comfort-value). Health and comfort are different kinds of value, yet medical decision-making incorporates both via an overarching norm of patient welfare. Similarly, responsible believing integrates truth and utility/morality via the overarching norm of agential rationality\u2014roughly, \u201cbelieve in ways that responsibly manage both accuracy and practical stakes.\u201d\n\n6. Formal Machinery: Decision-Theoretic Framing\n\nWe gain traction by modeling belief choice as a decision under uncertainty, where actions are cognitive states (believe p, withhold, believe \u00acp) and payoffs are composite functions of two dimensions:\n\nAccuracy payoff: +1 for true belief, \u20131 for false belief (simplest measure).\nPractical payoff: u depending on how having that belief affects wellbeing, morality, identity, etc.\n\nLet \u03b1 scale accuracy, \u03b2 scale practical utility. Expected composite value V = \u03b1\u00b7E(accuracy) + \u03b2\u00b7E(practical utility). Choosing the belief state that maximizes V is then the ATC ought. Weighing ERs and PRs becomes setting the weights \u03b1 and \u03b2.\n\nBut where do \u03b1 and \u03b2 come from? They cannot be arbitrary. Integrationism grounds them in rational agency\u2019s hierarchical norm:\n\nAccuracy is constitutive of belief. Thus \u03b1 enjoys a privileged, default weight (perhaps lexically prior, or at least normally dominant). Practical stakes can modulate \u03b2 upward when consequences are extreme (e.g., Pascal\u2019s infinite utility), or downward when minimal. Thus weights reflect context-\u200bsensitive rational priorities.\n\nImportantly, the model preserves distinctness: ERs feed into the expected accuracy term, PRs feed into the practical utility term. Deliberation occurs at a higher level where both terms reside.\n\n7. Clarifying the Constitutive Aim of Truth\n\nObjection: If belief constitutively aims at truth, isn\u2019t it conceptually incoherent to weigh anything else? I reply by distinguishing constitutive aim from overriding aim. Language is for communication, yet we legitimately weigh politeness or strategic deception against literal accuracy when speaking. Likewise, belief\u2019s function is to represent the world truly, but rational believers are creatures embedded in value-laden lives. Integrationism holds that satisfying belief\u2019s function normally carries lexical priority (accuracy counts for a lot), but not absolute priority. This fits ordinary practice: few people are willing to accept radical falsehood merely for minor comfort, yet many will believe the surgeon\u2019s optimistic spin because the marginal cost in accuracy is negligible given their evidence already uncertain, and the psychological benefit is substantial.\n\n8. Moral Dimensions and Doxastic Wrongs\n\nClifford\u2019s dictum\u2014\u201cit is wrong always, everywhere, and for any one to believe anything upon insufficient evidence\u201d\u2014highlights moral PRs against irresponsible believing: false comforting testimony can harm others. Integrationism incorporates such considerations: moral PRs enter the practical utility component, sometimes dominating. Imagine a demagogue who, lacking evidence, broadcasts conspiracy theories for political gain. For him, PRs (demagogic gain) favor belief; ERs disfavor. But integrating moral disvalue of spreading harmful falsehood shifts \u03b2 massively negative, making the composite V decisively negative. Thus demagogic belief is ATC wrong.\n\n9. Objections and Replies\n\nA. Commensurability Revisited: Does the linear additive model smuggle in comparability by fiat?\n\nReply: The model is an idealization. Real life may require lexicographic ordering or threshold dominance rather than simple addition. Integrationism\u2019s core claim is weaker: there exist rational principles (additive, lexicographic, or otherwise) that provide structured ways of adjudicating. What matters is that higher-order agential norms allow cross-value assessments, not that one particular arithmetic rule is correct.\n\nB. The \u201cGuessing\u201d Worry: Won\u2019t pragmatically weighted belief encourage wishful thinking?\n\nReply: Because \u03b1, the accuracy weight, is anchored in the constitutive aim of belief, cases of palpable violation of evidence (e.g., believing your lottery ticket will win) remain disallowed\u2014accuracy loss is too large. Wishful thinking is deterred because high accuracy disvalue outweighs modest practical gains. Only in exceptional, high-stakes cases (Pascalian or Jamesian forced options) can PRs overtake ERs.\n\nC. Transparency of Deliberation: Belief regulation is often sub-personal; you cannot choose beliefs by assessment of utilities.\n\nReply: Integrationism is a normative theory about what one ought to believe, not a descriptive psychology of belief formation. Even if conscious utility maximization rarely occurs, norms can still govern subconscious processes, and agents can approximate them via indirect control: seeking or avoiding evidence, exposing themselves to certain arguments, cultivating attitudes that tend toward certain credences.\n\nD. Epistemic Deontology: Are we blameworthy whenever we violate ERs, no matter the PRs?\n\nReply: Blameworthiness tracks ATC ought, not merely epistemic ought. If PRs legitimately override ERs (e.g., lying to save a life, or withholding distressing facts), then no epistemic blame attaches. Conversely, when PRs are illegitimate (career advancement by propagating falsehood), epistemic and moral blame coincide.\n\n10. Broader Implications\n\nThe integrationist framework explains several puzzles.\n\na. Pragmatic Encroachment: Why do knowledge attributions retract under high stakes? Because ATC justification thresholds rise when \u03b2 becomes large relative to \u03b1.\n\nb. Doxastic Partiality: Friendship or love sometimes license optimistic beliefs about loved ones. Integrationism accommodates permissible \u201cepistemic partiality\u201d when relationship-value PRs legitimately raise \u03b2.\n\nc. Epistemic Injustice: Societal power asymmetries make the practical costs of certain beliefs asymmetric across groups. Integrationism shows how moral PRs can obligate privileged epistemic agents to attend to marginalized testimony.\n\nd. Faith and Religion: Pascalian and Jamesian arguments find a principled (though not automatic) place: infinite or profound practical stakes can justify commitment when evidence is indecisive, without denying the independent authority of epistemic standards.\n\n11. Conclusion\n\nThe apparent incommensurability of epistemic and practical reasons rests on a level confusion: ERs and PRs indeed differ in base evaluative dimension, but deliberative believers are subject to a higher-order norm that addresses the agent as a whole. That integrative norm, call it Responsible Belief, coordinates distinct kinds of value within a unified choice architecture. We thus avoid the Scylla of reduction (which erases the genuine multiplicity of values) and the Charybdis of isolation (which leaves agents normatively rudderless). Reason Integrationism preserves the distinctive authority of truth while recognizing that human believers inhabit moral and pragmatic worlds. Consequently, what we ought, all things considered, to believe is the deliverance of a rational calculus that accounts for both evidence and stakes\u2014sometimes prioritizing the former, sometimes the latter, but always governed by an intelligible, unified standard.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 9, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 2756, "reasoning_tokens": 128}
{"question_id": "Maguire-GameBelief-2020", "question": "Some philosophers argue that there are both epistemic reasons (evidence-based) and practical reasons (concerning usefulness, harm, or moral considerations) that bear on what we ought to believe. However, these two types of reasons seem fundamentally different in kind\u2014epistemic reasons concern truth-conduciveness while practical reasons concern value or welfare. If both types of reasons genuinely bear on belief, how can they possibly interact to determine what one ought to believe, given that they seem incommensurable and thus impossible to weigh against each other directly?", "answer": "Epistemic-practical conflicts are among the most puzzling phenomena in contemporary normative theory. On the one hand, we inherit from the Enlightenment an apparently unshakeable conviction that beliefs are answerable to the tribunal of evidence\u2014whatever is most likely to be true, all things considered, is what we ought to believe. On the other hand, daily life presents vivid cases in which considerations of morality, prudence, or well-being appear to press on the very same \u201cought.\u201d A grieving parent might be better off believing that her missing child is still alive although the police evidence overwhelmingly suggests otherwise; a xenophobic juror might be required, morally, to suspend belief in the defendant\u2019s guilt until further proof is provided, even though the evidence already makes guilt the most probable hypothesis; or a physician might rationally prefer to believe an optimistic diagnosis that increases the patient\u2019s chance of recovery through placebo pathways, despite weaker evidential support. \n\nHow can these considerations\u2014one truth-directed, the other value-directed\u2014interact coherently, especially if, as many think, they are incommensurable? In what follows, I defend a two-level, hybrid account of the normativity of belief that both respects the special authority of truth-conducive reasons and allows weighty practical reasons to bear on what we all-things-considered ought to believe. The core claim is that epistemic and practical reasons are commensurable only at a higher, second-order level of normativity, where they are integrated by rules governing the management of one\u2019s doxastic agency rather than by direct trade-offs at the first-order level of evidential assessment. The resulting view preserves a robust evidentialism about first-order belief formation while underwriting a genuine, but structurally limited, role for practical considerations. \n\nI proceed in five steps. (1) I sharpen the incommensurability problem by reviewing three influential ways of characterising the apparent clash between epistemic and practical reasons. (2) I argue that attempts at direct commensuration\u2014straightforward weighing of practical value against evidential strength\u2014fail because they either collapse into pragmatic encroachment views that misdescribe scientific practice, or they threaten the distinctive point of belief itself. (3) I introduce the two-level framework, inspired by familiar distinctions in both moral theory (e.g., rule/act utilitarianism) and decision theory (e.g., object-level/payoff-level). (4) I show how this framework accommodates the intuitive force of practical reasons through the notion of higher-order epistemic policies, including permissibility constraints, doxastic shields, and suspension norms. (5) I close by replying to three major objections: that the proposal is ad hoc; that it renders practical reasons too weak; and that it multiplies oughts beyond necessity. \n\n1. Sharpening the Problem of Incommensurability  \n\nPhilosophers have pressed the puzzle via at least three related arguments.\n\na. The Distinct Aim Argument: Belief aims at truth, while practical considerations aim at value. If reasons are appropriate relative to an aim, then only truth-conducive reasons are constitutive of belief. Practical reasons are therefore reasons for something else\u2014perhaps for pretending, imagining, or acting\u2014as opposed to believing.  \n\nb. The Weightlessness Argument: Even if practical considerations sometimes matter, no common currency exists in which to measure evidential strength against, say, moral harm. Without such a currency, there is no coherent procedure for determining what one ought, all things considered, to believe.  \n\nc. The Rational Unity Argument: A single all-things-considered ought should guide integrated, rational agents. If epistemic and practical reasons cannot be compared, either the agent fractures into competing subsystems or rational unity is sacrificed. \n\nTaken jointly, these arguments appear to corner us into one of two unattractive extremes: (i) strict evidentialism, which denies that practical reasons ever bear on belief, relegating them to reasons for indirect management of one\u2019s evidence-gathering behaviour; or (ii) pragmatic permissivism, which allows nearly any practical consideration to swamp evidence whenever stakes are high, thereby undermining the transparency and reliability of belief.  \n\n2. The Failure of Direct Commensuration  \n\nSome philosophers attempt to salvage a unitary, first-order balancing model by importing tools from expected-utility theory: assign evidential probabilities on one axis and practical payoffs on the other; multiply; and choose the belief that maximises expected value. Although elegant, such models face two fatal objections.\n\nFirst, they deviate from entrenched epistemic practice. Scientists, detectives, historians, and ordinary reasoners do not adjust belief thresholds merely because the social cost of error rises or falls. We demand stronger evidence before convicting than before conjecturing, but this is plausibly a matter of decision, not of belief: the juror must decide whether to convict; she need not calibrate her private credence proportionally to the defendant\u2019s potential sentence. Conflating belief with action obscures this difference.\n\nSecond, direct commensuration threatens the functional role of belief. Beliefs are posits for representing the world, enabling accurate prediction and explanation. If one\u2019s belief that p is true solely because such a belief would produce better consequences, belief becomes a species of wishful thinking, and its representational function collapses. Epistemic trust\u2014among scientists, journalists, friends\u2014would be undermined if we licensed belief on practical grounds whenever stakes are high.\n\nThus, direct weighing at the first order is both sociologically unrealistic and normatively self-defeating. To locate a constructive alternative we must look elsewhere.\n\n3. The Two-Level, Hybrid Framework  \n\nA promising path emerges from two familiar normative ideas: first, that there can be multiple kinds of ought (Korsgaard, Parfit, Schroeder), and second, that higher-order norms can govern how first-order norms are applied (Hooker, Bales). Translate these ideas into the epistemic domain and we obtain:\n\nLevel 1 \u2013 First-order doxastic norms: An agent ought1 to believe p iff p is sufficiently supported by her evidence E. \u201cSufficiently\u201d is threshold-relative\u2014roughly, credence \u2265 .9 for categorical belief\u2014but the threshold is itself fixed by broadly evidential considerations alone, such as coherence, explanatory power, and reliability of sources.\n\nLevel 2 \u2013 Higher-order management norms: An agent ought2 to adopt, revise, or maintain policies about forming, suspending, or discarding beliefs so as to realise a suite of higher-order values, including truth, but also error-avoidance where errors would be catastrophic, respect for others, social trust, and psychological well-being.\n\nCrucially, practical reasons operate only at Level 2. They inform policies that govern when to collect further evidence, when to suspend judgment, when to seek independent verification, and so forth. But once those policies determinately deliver a body of evidence E, Level-1 assessment proceeds purely epistemically. The apparent \u201cinteraction\u201d of reasons is therefore indirect: practical reasons shape the evidential landscape or the permissible attitude (belief, disbelief, suspension) rather than tilt the evidential scales themselves. \n\nAn analogy with safety engineering clarifies. Suppose evidence suggests a bridge is 90% likely to hold. Whether to drive a bus full of children onto it depends both on probability (epistemic) and on stakes (practical). The engineer sets a policy: do not cross bridges less than 99% likely to hold when children are aboard. The policy is justified by practical reasons; but once the policy is fixed, whether the bridge is 99% or 89% safe is a strictly evidential matter. Similarly, in the doxastic case: practical reasons justify the threshold or the licence to suspend belief, but the truth of the proposition \u201cthe bridge will hold\u201d is still assessed by the best available engineering evidence alone.\n\n4. How the Framework Works in Practice  \n\nLet us revisit our initial cases.\n\nCase 1: The grieving parent. Level 1 says: given the police\u2019s evidence, ought1-belief: \u201cMy child is dead.\u201d Level 2 says: adopting a policy of \u201cpermit hopeful suspension when belief would devastate psychological functioning with no instrumental gain\u201d may be justified. Practical reasons support a doxastic shield\u2014she is permitted not to believe the evidentially favoured proposition. But she is not permitted to believe its negation without evidence; suspension satisfies both levels.\n\nCase 2: The xenophobic juror. Level 2 incorporates fairness norms: \u201cWhen you harbour implicit bias, raise the evidential threshold before believing guilt.\u201d The juror must suspend judgment pending stronger proof. Practical moral considerations adjust the first-order threshold, not the weight of evidence.\n\nCase 3: The optimistic diagnosis. A physician might adopt a policy: \u201cWhen placebo effects could improve outcomes, present the positive scenario while privately suspending full belief.\u201d She forms no categorical belief in the optimistic prognosis; instead she holds a credence or hypothesis, leaving room for later revisions. The patient may benefit practically, but the physician\u2019s own belief remains proportioned to evidence.  \n\nIn each case, practical reasons influence permissible epistemic stances, primarily by recommending suspension, credal moderation, or evidence-seeking. But they do not by themselves render outright belief or disbelief epistemically justified when evidence is lacking.\n\n5. Responses to Objections  \n\nObjection 1: Ad Hoc proliferation. Critics may say the two-level structure is manufactured to dodge the hard question rather than to solve it. Why not simply declare that there are multiple, incommensurable oughts and be done?\n\nReply: The two-level model earns its keep by predicting and systematising a broad range of intuitions. It explains why we think practical considerations can require suspension but balk at calling wishful optimism belief-worthy. It parallels entrenched practices in science (peer review policies), law (beyond a reasonable doubt), and ordinary life (double-checking before critical decisions). Far from ad hoc, the model generalises existing institutional wisdom.\n\nObjection 2: Practical reasons are still too weak. What about urgent moral cases where believing a comforting falsehood would produce immense good and no harm\u2014shouldn\u2019t we sometimes believe against evidence?\n\nReply: The objection conflates psychological feasibility with normative permission. One might psychologically end up believing a comforting falsehood; but that belief is still epistemically criticisable. Compare action: stealing a small amount to save a life may be morally permissible, but it is still legally theft. Distinct norm domains can conflict, and sometimes we choose to satisfy the weightier domain. The two-level account accommodates such tragic choices: the person can choose to violate the epistemic \u201cought1\u201d in favour of a moral \u201cought2.\u201d She is then epistemically criticisable yet morally praiseworthy\u2014exactly the mixed evaluation that fits our linguistic and social practices.\n\nObjection 3: Too many oughts spoil rational unity. If agents face divergent oughts, aren\u2019t they rationally fractured?\n\nReply: Rational unity does not require that all reasons be aggregable in a single metric; it requires that agents be able reflectively to endorse a coherent plan acknowledging domain-specific requirements and prioritising among them. Moral philosophers routinely accept that legality, prudence, and morality can conflict; resolving such conflicts is an exercise in practical reason, not evidence that only one true ought exists. Similarly, epistemic and practical oughts can conflict. What matters is whether the agent can explain her choice in recognisably normative terms, not whether a single numerical weight adjudicates everything.\n\n6. Payoffs and Broader Implications  \n\nThe upshot is a hybrid picture that combines:\n\na. Normative pluralism: There are at least two irreducible kinds of reasons for belief.  \nb. Level-relativity: These reasons have proper offices at different levels of doxastic governance.  \nc. Indirect interaction: Practical reasons influence doxastic outcomes only through higher-order policies that shape evidence accumulation or attitude selection (belief vs suspension).  \n\nThis framework avoids the excesses of strict evidentialism (which ignores the legitimate governance of belief by moral and prudential concerns) and the pitfalls of pragmatism (which undermines the representational function of belief). It also aligns with recent work on higher-order evidence: defeaters can operate at the policy level (e.g., \u201cIf you learn that you are prone to confirmation bias, discount your confidence\u201d).  \n\nOne attractive corollary is that \u201cought to believe\u201d is context-sensitive because higher-order stakes vary. Medical, legal, and everyday contexts demand higher or lower thresholds for belief, explaining why we intuitively accept differentiated standards of proof without abandoning the idea that belief aims at truth.  \n\nFinally, the proposal sparks fruitful research programs: empirical psychology can investigate which higher-order policies actually optimise both truth and welfare; social epistemology can examine how institutions encode such policies (newsroom fact-checking, scientific replication); and metaethics can explore analogies with moral pluralism and integrity.  \n\nConclusion  \n\nEpistemic and practical reasons indeed differ in kind; yet they need not be weighed head-to-head to jointly determine what one ought to believe. By situating them at distinct but coordinated normative levels, we can preserve the integrity of truth-conducive norms while acknowledging the legitimate governance of belief by values such as harm-avoidance and justice. The resulting view vindicates our everyday judgment that sometimes the right thing to do is to suspend belief, seek more evidence, or even consciously risk epistemic blame for the sake of higher goods, without surrendering the fundamental epistemic norm that evidence alone determines what is true.  \n\nWord count: approx. 2,040", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 10, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 3071, "reasoning_tokens": 192}
{"question_id": "Maguire-GameBelief-2020", "question": "Some philosophers argue that there are both epistemic reasons (evidence-based) and practical reasons (concerning usefulness, harm, or moral considerations) that bear on what we ought to believe. However, these two types of reasons seem fundamentally different in kind\u2014epistemic reasons concern truth-conduciveness while practical reasons concern value or welfare. If both types of reasons genuinely bear on belief, how can they possibly interact to determine what one ought to believe, given that they seem incommensurable and thus impossible to weigh against each other directly?", "answer": "Epistemic-pragmatic conflicts are as old as philosophy itself. Socrates prized truth above all, while Pascal insisted that eternal felicity can swamp ordinary evidential considerations. Contemporary epistemology inherits both impulses. On the one hand, there is an austere picture according to which only evidential or \u201cepistemic\u201d reasons ever bear on what one ought to believe; on the other, almost everyone recognizes circumstances in which what it would be best to do, or to be, or to bring about, seems to urge belief in excess of\u2014or even against\u2014the evidence. The resulting puzzle can be sharpened in three steps.\n\n1. Two kinds of normativity.  \n   a. Epistemic reasons are truth-oriented: they render a belief \u201cfitting,\u201d \u201cwarranted,\u201d \u201cjustified\u201d\u2014or, in contemporary jargon, supported by sufficient probability with respect to the truth.  \n   b. Practical reasons are value-oriented: they counsel what would make the world better, or us happier, or our fellow creatures safer, whether or not the resulting belief is likely to be true.\n\n2. Mutual relevance. Yet both sorts of reasons undeniably seem to matter. When the oncologist tells her patient that a positive attitude raises post-surgical survival rates, she is moved by more than clinical evidence about tumor recurrence. When James defends \u201cThe Will to Believe,\u201d he invokes the moral and personal costs of agnosticism. Most of us feel pulled by both kinds of considerations, at least sometimes.\n\n3. The incommensurability challenge. Epistemic and practical reasons appear to answer to different \u201cstandards of correctness.\u201d How, then, could they possibly weigh against each other in a single deliberation that issues in an \u201call-things-considered\u201d ought? A kilogram of truth cannot be put on the same scale as a util of happiness\u2014so it seems.\n\nBelow I sketch the terrain and defend what I call the \u201chigher-order unification\u201d view. Briefly stated, epistemic and practical reasons do not compete directly at the first order; rather, they are inputs to a higher-order deliberative norm whose function is to decide which first-order norm is authoritative here and now. Once that meta-norm is brought into focus, incommensurability ceases to be mysterious. We still have two fundamentally different kinds of first-order reasons, but they interact indirectly, via a common currency supplied by the higher-order norm. I proceed in five stages:\n\nI. Clarifying kinds of reasons  \nII. Why reduction and isolation both fail  \nIII. The structure of higher-order reasons  \nIV. Answering worries about weighing and commensurability  \nV. Objections and replies\n\nI. Clarifying kinds of reasons\n\nWe need a reasonably sharp distinction if we are to discuss interaction. Let us adopt the following preliminary glosses.\n\nEpistemic reasons: facts or propositions that bear on the probability that p is true. Paradigmatically, that I saw rain fall outside the window is an epistemic reason to believe that it is raining.\n\nPractical reasons: considerations that bear on the value of believing (or not believing) p, irrespective of p\u2019s truth. That believing I will succeed increases my chances, or that believing God exists yields infinite expected utility, are practical reasons by this lights.\n\nTwo refinements are helpful.\n\n1. Pro tanto vs. overall normativity. Reasons are normally pro tanto; they favor without determining. Only when all reasons are considered do we reach an \u201cought simpliciter.\u201d\n\n2. Role-relative authority. Epistemic norms aim at a telos\u2014truth, knowledge, intellectual virtue\u2014while practical norms aim at welfare or morality. Which telos is authoritative in a given context is itself a normative question.\n\nII. Why reduction and isolation both fail\n\nPhilosophers typically try either to collapse one domain into the other (reduction) or to cordon them off entirely (isolation).\n\n1. Reduction strategies\n\na. Pragmatic encroachment. Some argue (Fantl & McGrath, Ross & Schroeder) that practical stakes figure constitutively in what it is to have knowledge or justified belief. If the cost of error is high, the evidential threshold rises; thus practical considerations get \u201cencoded\u201d inside epistemic norms themselves.\n\nb. Truth\u2019s special value. Others maintain that truth is the only ultimate value; practical benefits matter only insofar as they derive from possessing truth (or avoiding error). Here the reduction runs the other way: practical reasons dissolve into truth-based concerns.\n\nBoth moves face trouble. Pragmatic encroachment yields implausible attributions (the same evidence justifies for the rich but not for the poor?). Truth-monism cannot explain why, say, placebo beliefs are rationally permissible, let alone obligatory, when the health benefits are huge and the evidential divergence from truth is tiny.\n\n2. Isolation strategies\n\nSeveral philosophers adopt a dual-ought view: there is what you epistemically ought to believe and, separately, what you pragmatically ought to believe (Wedgwood, Coates). Ordinarily we let the epistemic ought govern belief; but if the stakes are high enough, we may place the practical ought first. Because there is no single scale, there is no conflict\u2014merely differing questions.\n\nYet complete isolation leaves deliberators without guidance when the oughts diverge. Imagine a nurse who must decide whether to reassure a terrified patient that everything will be fine despite ambiguous test results. Epistemically she ought to remain agnostic; practically (for the patient\u2019s well-being) she ought to pronounce optimism. Which verdict should she follow? The dual-ought theorist can only shrug or supply some higher rule\u2014thus smuggling in precisely the kind of integration isolation wanted to avoid.\n\nIII. The structure of higher-order reasons\n\nThe higher-order unification view I defend can be stated in two theses.\n\nHO-Determination: Whether, all things considered, one ought to believe p is determined by which first-order normative standard\u2014epistemic or practical\u2014is authoritative in the context.\n\nHO-Governance: Which standard is authoritative is itself settled by higher-order reasons that are commensurable because they share a single currency: the value of following the correct standard.\n\nCall that currency \u201cnormative adequacy.\u201d The core idea is familiar in other domains. In moral philosophy we confront conflicts between agent-centered and act-consequentialist reasons; rather than trying to blend them at the first order, some Kantians argue that at a higher level we must decide which perspective is appropriate (e.g., when occupying the role of a promise-keeper versus a legislator of ends). Likewise, in law adjudication, we appeal to \u201cmeta-interpretive\u201d principles (fidelity to statute, justice, efficiency) that tell us which first-order interpretive method to use.\n\nHow does this play out for belief?\n\n1. First-order standards\n\nE-Norm: Believe p iff your total evidence renders p sufficiently probable (where \u201csufficient\u201d is governed by a probability threshold Te).\n\nP-Norm: Believe p iff the expected value (for you or morally relevant parties) of believing p exceeds that of alternative cognitive attitudes (where value is computed over outcomes conditional on belief).\n\n2. Higher-order deliberation\n\nConsider Martha, an army medic deciding whether to believe that the meadow is safe to traverse. Her evidence is weak (~0.45 that no landmines remain). But if she and her casualties stay put exposure may kill them. P-Norm strongly favors belief; E-Norm favors withholding. According to higher-order unification, Martha should ask: Which standard ought I to follow here? The relevant higher-order reasons include:\n\na. Source authority. In combat, survival is paramount; the epistemic standard is derivative to pragmatic success.  \nb. Moral costs. If Martha withholds and insists on further reconnaissance, wounded soldiers may die.  \nc. Epistemic integrity. Overriding evidence erodes habits crucial for long-term reliability.\n\nThese higher-order reasons are all couched in a single evaluative dimension: the stakes of following vs. not following a given norm. They are commensurable because each concerns the value of selecting a norm. Once the reasons are balanced, a verdict emerges: e.g., \u201cIn emergencies with high moral stakes, follow P-Norm.\u201d Hence Martha ought to believe the meadow is clear, even though the purely epistemic balance points the other way.\n\nIV. Answering worries about weighing and commensurability\n\nThree objections loom large.\n\nObjection 1: No common metric. Practical reasons trade in welfare; epistemic reasons trade in truth. A higher-order appeal to \u201cvalue\u201d merely postpones the problem unless we show how welfare and truth can be compared.\n\nReply. They need not be compared directly; only the value of adhering to one or another norm does. That value can, and often does, incorporate multiple dimensions\u2014just as public-policy cost-benefit analyses combine human lives, dollars, and environmental goods. Philosophers of rational choice (Broome 2013) treat reasons as predicates of promoting good; the goods can be plural, but the question \u201cWhich set of goods is more important here?\u201d is intelligible and ordinary. We lack precise cardinal scales, yet we routinely judge, say, that avoiding one child\u2019s death outweighs saving two seconds of commuter time. Deliberation proceeds with rough but determinate verdicts, guided by experience and moral intuition. Likewise, we can judge that \u201censuring medical success in extreme conditions\u201d outweighs \u201cmaintaining perfect evidential fit\u201d without assigning numbers to either.\n\nObjection 2: Higher-order conflict regress. Suppose higher-order reasons themselves conflict: some support E-Norm authority, others P-Norm. Don\u2019t we need a higher-higher-order principle, launching a vicious regress?\n\nReply. The regress is blocked because the higher-order level is not one among many, but the point at which the deliberative question is settled. If the balance is indeterminate, practical rationality delivers permission rather than an obligation (allowing for \u201cdoxastic permissivism\u201d). We need no further rule to adjudicate; indeterminacy at the higher-order level just is indeterminacy about what one ought to believe all things considered, and permissibility is a stable stopping point.\n\nObjection 3: Incoherence with doxastic involuntarism. Beliefs are not under voluntary control, so talk of \u201cdeciding which standard to follow\u201d is misconceived.\n\nReply. Even if belief is not directly voluntary, we can influence it indirectly via attention, inquiry, selective weighting of evidence. Higher-order resolutions guide those cognitive behaviors. Adopting E-Norm means e.g. refraining from motivated reasoning; adopting P-Norm may mean seeking affect-enhancing cues. Control is imperfect but genuine, analogous to controlling emotion through perspective taking.\n\nV. Objections and replies in detail\n\n1. The placebo case\n\nClinicians sometimes give patients optimistic prognoses not supported by evidence, thereby fostering healthier outcomes. Is it really true, on my view, that the clinician ought to believe the rosy story? The higher-order test says: evaluate the value of allegiance to norms. Truthfulness in medical contexts underpins informed consent and trust, which in turn have massive downstream health benefits. Therefore higher-order reasons often favor E-Norm (or at least robust honesty) even where short-term welfare points the other way. The placebo case ceases to threaten: the clinician may justifiably cause the patient to believe, but herself ought not to believe the deception.\n\n2. Pascal\u2019s Wager\n\nDoes higher-order unification vindicate Pascal? Only if the higher-order balance favors using practical stakes to govern religious belief production. Yet we have weighty higher-order reasons to mistrust P-Norm where evidence is easily gathered and error costs to third parties are grave (religious violence, intolerance). So the view allows us to reject doxastic gambling in many real-world contexts while explaining why some historical agents, facing asymmetrical payoffs and low evidential clarity, could rationally give P-Norm authority.\n\n3. Jamesian genuine options\n\nJames famously argued that when a hypothesis is (i) momentous, (ii) forced, and (iii) evidence-undecided, it is permissible to decide by the passional nature. The higher-order view refines this: in genuine option cases the higher-order reasons for E-Norm and P-Norm roughly cancel; permissibility, not obligation, results. James\u2019s \u201cmay\u201d rather than \u201cmust\u201d falls naturally out of the model.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe began with an apparent impasse: epistemic reasons point to truth, practical reasons to value, and their incommensurability threatens any unified account of what one ought to believe. Attempts at reduction erase genuine distinctions; isolation leaves us normatively rudderless. The higher-order unification strategy retains the honour of both domains while explaining how they interact without impossible weighing. First-order epistemic and practical reasons never clash head-to-head; instead, they feed into a second-order deliberation about which standard should govern here and now. Because those higher-order reasons share a single concern\u2014choosing the right standard\u2014they are commensurable in principle, even if precise quantification is rare.\n\nThe resulting picture is pluralist yet hierarchical. There are genuinely different kinds of first-order reasons for belief, rooted in distinct values. Still, practical deliberation about belief ultimately must decide which value to prioritize. Far from being anomalous, this mirrors the structure of human agency in general, where we constantly toggle between role-dependent norms: parent versus citizen, scientist versus friend, musician versus neighbour. Epistemic agency is no exception.\n\nPhilosophy, William James said, is \u201ca quest for the temper of mind in which one can live most honestly and happily.\u201d Honesty (truth) and happiness (value) need not vie for absolute primacy; they can be partners in a richer economy of reasons once we acknowledge the higher-order perspective that adjudicates between their claims.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 11, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 3369, "reasoning_tokens": 448}
{"question_id": "Maguire-GameBelief-2020", "question": "Some philosophers argue that there are both epistemic reasons (evidence-based) and practical reasons (concerning usefulness, harm, or moral considerations) that bear on what we ought to believe. However, these two types of reasons seem fundamentally different in kind\u2014epistemic reasons concern truth-conduciveness while practical reasons concern value or welfare. If both types of reasons genuinely bear on belief, how can they possibly interact to determine what one ought to believe, given that they seem incommensurable and thus impossible to weigh against each other directly?", "answer": "Epistemic Versus Practical Reasons for Belief: How Can They Be Weighed Together?\n\n1. Setting the Puzzle\n\nTo believe is, on the face of it, to aim at the truth: if I discover that p is false I withdraw my belief that p, and if I discover that q is true I am inclined to embrace q. For that reason many philosophers have held that the only genuine reasons that bear on what one ought to believe are epistemic reasons\u2014considerations that tell in favor of p\u2019s being true (or against its being false).  William Clifford famously insisted that \u201cit is wrong always, everywhere, and for any one, to believe anything upon insufficient evidence,\u201d thus denying practical considerations any authority at the bar of belief.  Yet there is a long counter-tradition, from Pascal and James through contemporary pragmatic encroachment theorists, that insists that practical considerations can also bear on what we ought to believe.  If believing that my treatment will succeed increases my chance of recovery (James\u2019s mountain-climber or physician cases), if believing a comforting falsehood spares a friend unbearable anguish, or if believing on faith holds a community together, then, so it is urged, there are practical reasons\u2014reasons of value or welfare\u2014for belief.\n\nThis mixed-reasons picture raises a conspicuous worry.  Epistemic and practical reasons look incommensurable.  The first concern truth tracking, the second welfare promotion.  Probability of truth and degrees of value are not obviously measurable on a common scale, so how could they be combined into an \u201call-things-considered\u201d answer to the question what I ought to believe?  Either we face an impossible weighing of apples against bicycles, or we must deny that both kinds of considerations make genuine normative claims on belief.\n\nI shall defend the possibility of integration.  In outline: (i) epistemic and practical reasons are indeed different kinds, but (ii) there are general theoretical frameworks\u2014both quantitative and qualitative\u2014that allow heterogeneous reasons to interact without flattening their differences, and (iii) we have strong antecedent motivation for thinking they must interact, because actual deliberation about belief, both personal and social, displays precisely such integration.  The incommensurability worry dissolves once we see that commensurability need not be reductive or metric; it is enough that there be ordering relations that rational agents can recognise.\n\n2. Clarifying the Terrain: Two Sorts of Normative Authority\n\nTalk of \u201creasons\u201d is famously flexible.  I shall follow the popular \u201cnormative reasons\u201d usage: a reason for \u03c6-ing is a consideration that counts in favour of \u03c6-ing, whose bearing is such that the agent would be, ceteris paribus, rationally criticisable for ignoring it.\n\n2.1 Epistemic reasons.  These are considerations whose bearing is exhausted by the way they indicate, evidence, explain, or otherwise support the truth of a proposition.  If the thermometer reads 39\u00b0 and I know it is reliable, that is a paradigm epistemic reason to believe the patient has a fever.\n\n2.2 Practical reasons.  These are considerations that support belief in virtue of the value of holding that belief (or of the value conferred by subsequent states\u2014emotional equanimity, moral betterment, social cohesion, successful action, etc.).  They are not truth-indicative, but welfare-indicative.\n\nNothing hinges on whether \u201cmoral\u201d reasons form a subset of practical reasons; the important point is that their normative valence is realised independently of p\u2019s truth or falsity.\n\n3. Exclusionary and Reductionist Escape Routes\n\nBefore showing how the two can interact, let us dispose of two tempting moves that avoid the problem by dissolving one side.\n\n3.1 Pure-epistemicism.  On this view (Clifford, contemporary \u201cright-kind-wrong-kind\u201d theorists) only epistemic reasons are \u201cright-kind\u201d reasons for belief; practical reasons are always \u201cwrong-kind\u201d\u2014they might tempt or motivate us, but they cannot determine what we epistemically ought to believe.  The worry about incommensurability is sidestepped by denial.  Yet pure-epistemicism faces recalcitrant data: (a) morally urgent cases such as the suicidal patient whose recovery hinges on hopeful belief; (b) legal contexts where the presumption of innocence demands withholding belief beyond reasonable doubt out of fairness, not solely evidence; (c) pervasive \u201cstakes sensitivity\u201d in science funding, earthquake prediction, medicine.  Pure-epistemicism must either redescribe these as not genuinely belief decisions (but \u201cacceptance\u201d in van Fraassen\u2019s sense) or condemn widespread practice as systematically irrational.  This is dialectically costly.\n\n3.2 Reductionism.  Decision-theorists sometimes suggest that practical reasons can be recast as epistemic by embedding utilities into an \u201cexpected epistemic utility\u201d framework: because it will be worth more, all things considered, to have a true belief when the stakes are high, my practical interests simply adjust the evidential threshold.  But this turns on treating truth as the only final value and smuggling welfare into the weighting of truths.  That may work if my reason to believe p (e.g., that God exists) is that believing p maximises expected utility\u2014yet this justification seems orthogonal to p\u2019s truth and so remains practical in the intuitive sense.  Reduction therefore fails to vindicate the intuition that the two kinds of reasons are distinct.\n\nWe should instead accept their distinctness and ask: how can heterogeneous reasons jointly bear on belief without collapsing into chaos?\n\n4. Lessons from Moral Theory: Pluralism Without Mayhem\n\nMoral philosophy routinely weighs heterogeneous values: rights against utilities, promises against beneficence, desert against equality.  Value pluralists (e.g., Isaiah Berlin, Joseph Raz) hold that genuine practical deliberation involves non-reducible values that nevertheless can be ranked, sometimes incompletely, by practical reason.  The comparison is imperfect\u2014moral reasons concern what to do, not what to believe\u2014but the methodological moral is clear: difference in kind need not entail incomparability.  We should resist the assumption that only cardinal metrics allow commensuration.  Qualitative, context-sensitive comparison suffices for normative guidance.\n\n5. A Formal Model: Dual-Utility Expected Value\n\nStill, many philosophers want a more systematic account than \u201cintuitive balancing\u201d.  Consider a simplified Bayesian-decision framework.  Let Bel(p) be the state of believing p.  We assign:\n\n(1) Epistemic Utility (EU): typically 1 for true belief, 0 for false belief.  (In refined versions, degrees of correctness or explanatory power vary EU.)\n\n(2) Practical Utility (PU): a numeric value capturing the welfare effect of holding Bel(p).  PU can be positive (when believing p helps the patient) or negative (when believing p leads to harmful action).\n\nThe all-things-considered Expected Utility (AEU) of believing p on evidence E is:\n\nAEU(Bel p | E) = Pr(p | E) \u00d7 (EU_true + PU_true) + (1 \u2013 Pr(p | E)) \u00d7 (EU_false + PU_false)\n\nEU_true and EU_false may be fixed (say, +1 and \u20131) to represent the epistemic aim.  PU_true and PU_false vary with context.  A rational agent maximises AEU: believe p when the expected net value of believing outweighs that of withholding or believing \u00acp.\n\nThis model renders epistemic and practical utilities commensurable by postulating a common utility scale.  Is this legitimate?  The commensurability is stipulated, not discovered; but that is precisely what decision theory supposes about action.  Agents unify heterogeneous goods by placing them into a single preference ordering.  If belief is treated as a mental \u201caction,\u201d the same machinery applies.\n\nObjection: This instrumentalises belief, ignoring its constitutive aim at truth.  Reply: in the model EU is lexicographically primary insofar as it is always present; PU is supplementary.  We can, if we like, impose a threshold: never believe a proposition whose evidential probability falls below \u03b8, no matter the PU.  Alternatively, EU may simply be large relative to usual PU, so that only extreme practical stakes outweigh modest evidential deficits.\n\n6. A Qualitative Alternative: Reason Holism and Default Priority\n\nFormal models court the complaint of artificial precision.  We can instead adapt Jonathan Dancy\u2019s holism about reasons.  On Dancy\u2019s view, what a reason favours, and with what strength, depends on the context of other reasons.  Epistemic reasons typically have prima facie priority in belief-formation; practical reasons acquire relevance only under special background conditions\u2014e.g., when the stakes cross a seriousness threshold, or when no decisive epistemic verdict is available (the evidence is balanced).  That delivers the right pattern:\n\n\u2022 Ordinary low-stakes inquiry: only epistemic reasons matter.\n\n\u2022 High-stakes moral or prudential contexts: practical reasons can intensify (strengthen) or override (defeat) epistemic reasons.\n\nHolism blocks the need for fixed cardinal weights.  We compare reasons only relationally: R1 overrides R2 in context C if R1\u2019s pro tanto force is stronger than R2\u2019s pro tanto force in C.  Agents need not compute numbers; they exercise discernment.  Yet nothing in the view bars cross-category comparison: holism was designed precisely to allow comparison among disparate considerations.\n\n7. Illustrative Cases\n\nCase 1: The Mountain-Climber.  Evidence that she can jump the crevasse is indifferent; expert consensus is 50/50.  Believing she can jump will increase her actual performance probability to 70%.  The PU of confident belief is thus life-saving.  Here epistemic reasons do not decide\u2014probability .5 versus .5 for each of two propositions (\u201cI can\u201d/\u201cI cannot\u201d).  Practical reasons settle the matter rationally: she ought to believe she can.\n\nCase 2: The Innocence Presumption.  A juror has strong but not conclusive evidence of guilt (say .8).  Practical reasons of justice\u2014risk of wrongful conviction, social commitment to the presumption of innocence\u2014demand a higher evidential threshold for belief, so she ought to withhold belief until evidence is beyond reasonable doubt.  Practical considerations intensify the demand for epistemic adequacy; they do not override evidence but raise the bar.\n\nCase 3: The Deadly Rumor.  A community is prone to violent reprisals if they believe a rumor that the neighboring tribe plotted to poison the well.  Evidence is 30% in favor.  Practical reasons (preserving peace) tell strongly against adopting belief.  The combined reasons counsel agnosticism or disbelief despite some evidence in favor.\n\nThese cases map neatly onto both the quantitative and qualitative frameworks sketched above.\n\n8. Challenges and Replies\n\n8.1 The Exclusivity Objection: Belief is constitutively regulated by the norm \u201cBelieve p only if p is true,\u201d so practical reasons are conceptually irrelevant.  Reply: The norm in question is more plausibly \u201cAim at truth,\u201d which leaves open whether considerations that facilitate successfully hitting that aim (e.g., self-fulfilling confidence) may permissibly influence belief.  Even some evidentialists (e.g., Conee and Feldman) admit permissive cases of evidential indeterminacy; the pragmatic encroachment thesis claims only an extension of that permissiveness.\n\n8.2 The Asymmetry Objection: Practical reasons can permissibly increase evidential thresholds (demand more evidence) but can never lower them.  The physician may need more evidence before declaring a terminal diagnosis, but may not believe on less evidence than usual to comfort a patient.  Reply: The asymmetry thesis is attractive but not indefeasible.  James\u2019s examples, placebos, and self-efficacy research show cases where lowering thresholds seems rational.  Still, one could combine my integrationist view with an asymmetry constraint without inconsistency.\n\n8.3 The Insincerity Objection: Believing for practical reasons is merely \u201cmake-belief,\u201d not genuine belief.  But the psychological literature on self-deception and doxastic voluntarism suggests that our cognitive systems can modulate credence in response to affective stakes without faking.  Moreover, even if the mechanism is indirect (focusing attention, seeking further confirming data) the normative verdict\u2014one ought to allow that modulation\u2014is still meaningful.\n\n9. Commensurability Without Reduction: The Metanormative Moral\n\nWhat underwrites commensurability?  Two metanormative claims suffice:\n\n(i) Rational agency imposes a requirement of overall coherence among one\u2019s attitudes, whether practical or epistemic.\n\n(ii) Coherence is governed by ordered preferences or by defeasible priority relations, neither of which requires value monism.\n\nThat structure, independently motivated in action theory, naturally extends to belief once we recognise that believing is something we can be normatively assessable for under multiple dimensions\u2014truth-orientation and value-orientation.\n\n10. A Sketch of Lexicographic Priority\n\nWhile I have argued for integrability, some remain uneasy that catastrophic utilities might justify belief on arbitrarily thin evidence.  Nothing prevents us from building in a lexicographic ordering:\n\nRule L: Lexicographic Epistemic Priority.  (a) First, check whether evidential probability exceeds some context-invariant standard s (.5 or \u201cpreponderance\u201d).  (b) If yes, believe; if no, proceed to step (c).  (c) If practical stakes exceed catastrophic threshold t, allow practical utilities to govern; otherwise, withhold.\n\nL preserves the intuitive datum that normal belief fixation is evidence-driven, yet accommodates the Jamesian insight that \u201cmoral\u201d stakes can occasionally override.\n\n11. Implications for Epistemic Normativity\n\nAccepting mixed reasons carries three attractive implications:\n\n1. Epistemic Relativism of Stakes: It explains why scientists require 5\u03c3 to accept a Higgs-like particle (high cost of error) while daily life tolerates shakier inferences.  Practical costs (lost research time, misallocation of funds) shape evidential standards.\n\n2. Social Epistemology: Group belief often incorporates moral/political constraints (democratic inclusiveness, respect for testimony) alongside evidence.  Mixed-reasons theory makes sense of why such constraints are not mere externalities but integral to rational belief formation.\n\n3. Epistemic Virtue Ethics: Virtues like open-mindedness and intellectual courage balance the love of truth with concern for human flourishing.  The very vocabulary of virtue presupposes integration.\n\n12. Conclusion\n\nEpistemic and practical reasons for belief are different in kind, but difference of kind does not entail impossibility of comparison.  Decision-theoretic utility models, holist qualitative models, and lexicographic priority rules each furnish a blueprint for rational agents to integrate the two.  The incommensurability objection loses force once we recognise that practical deliberation already navigates heterogeneous values without cardinal commensuration, that belief is susceptible to the same holistic rational pressures, and that explanatory and normative adequacy point to a pluralist account.  We thereby secure a principled yet flexible picture: normally let evidence rule, but when the stakes are urgent or the evidence silent, let humane value step in\u2014rationally, coherently, and without philosophical embarrassment.\n\nWord count (approx.): 2,050", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 12, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 3781, "reasoning_tokens": 512}
{"question_id": "Maguire-GameBelief-2020", "question": "Some philosophers argue that there are both epistemic reasons (evidence-based) and practical reasons (concerning usefulness, harm, or moral considerations) that bear on what we ought to believe. However, these two types of reasons seem fundamentally different in kind\u2014epistemic reasons concern truth-conduciveness while practical reasons concern value or welfare. If both types of reasons genuinely bear on belief, how can they possibly interact to determine what one ought to believe, given that they seem incommensurable and thus impossible to weigh against each other directly?", "answer": "                                    Epistemic and Practical Reasons for Belief:\n                    Interaction Without Commensurability\n\nIntroduction  \nThe tension between epistemic and practical reasons has haunted modern epistemology ever since William Clifford (\u201cIt is wrong, always, everywhere, and for anyone, to believe anything upon insufficient evidence\u201d) squared off against William James (\u201cOur passional nature not only lawfully may, but must, decide an option between propositions whenever it is a genuine option that cannot by its nature be decided on intellectual grounds\u201d).  Clifford\u2019s rallying-cry suggests that only epistemic reasons\u2014considerations bearing on the likelihood that p is true\u2014matter to what one ought to believe.  James insists that sometimes what is most rational to believe is determined by non-epistemic stakes: the good to be gained, the harm to be avoided, the moral status of trust, hope, or solidarity.  Much recent work (pragmatic encroachment, moral encroachment, doxastic consequentialism, reasons pluralism) attempts to allow both kinds of reasons at the normative table.  Yet each kind seems incommensurable with the other.  Truth and utility are different dimensions; the familiar metaphors of \u201cweighing\u201d or \u201cbalancing\u201d break down when there is no common scale.\n\nHow, then, could epistemic and practical reasons jointly determine what one ought\u2014full stop\u2014to believe?  My answer develops in three stages.  (i)  I distinguish three different normative questions about belief and show that conflating them creates the felt impasse.  (ii)  I sketch a metanormative picture on which normative reasons, though plural, can rationally interact without being measured on a single scale.  The key idea is that reasons interact through structured priority rules rather than through cardinal commensuration.  (iii)  I defend a resulting hybrid view: epistemic reasons normally enjoy lexical priority, but sufficiently weighty practical reasons can nonetheless defeat them via higher-order obligations.  The interaction is real, principled, and illuminates disputed cases (James\u2019s \u201creligious hypothesis,\u201d Pascalian wagering, moral encroachment about racist belief, and ordinary high-stakes decision contexts).\n\nI.  Three Distinct \u2018Oughts\u2019  \nWhen we ask \u201cWhat ought S believe?\u201d we covertly shift among three different normative \u2018oughts\u2019:\n\n1. Epistemic ought (e-ought): What beliefs would best manifest the epistemic aim of truth (and perhaps also understanding, coherence)?  \n2. Practical ought (p-ought): What beliefs would best serve the agent\u2019s total practical ends (prudential, moral, aesthetic, political)?  \n3. All-things-considered ought (a-ought): What beliefs does S have most reason to hold simpliciter?\n\nOrthodoxy identifies the e-ought with justification, rationality, or knowledge; pragmatists focus on the p-ought.  The dispute arises only when we slide from either domain-relative ought to the global a-ought.  Keeping the three apart dissolves a good deal of confusion: nothing puzzling is going on when we say both (i) \u201cGiven the evidence, Jonas ought_e to believe the medication will work,\u201d and (ii) \u201cGiven the massive side-effects if he is mistaken, Jonas ought_p to withhold belief.\u201d  The conflict emerges only if we now ask the single question, \u201cSo what ought Jonas believe, full stop?\u201d\n\nThe incommensurability challenge is therefore a metanormative challenge about the a-ought.  How can normatively heterogeneous reasons jointly bear on that verdict?  Two extreme answers dominate the literature:\n\nA.  Purism: only epistemic reasons ever bear on belief.  Practical considerations may bear on what we should do with or about our beliefs (deliberately seek more evidence, avoid inquiry, fake confidence) but not on what we should believe.  Purism predicts that Jonas, all things considered, still ought to believe the pill will work.  \n\nB.  Pragmatic Monism: ultimately only practical reasons matter; truth-conduciveness is just another instrumental consideration because we value the benefits of holding true beliefs and avoiding error.  On this view Jonas ought to withhold because expected utility is lower if he trusts the evidence.\n\nBoth positions solve incommensurability by denying genuine pluralism.  Both face notorious problems.  Purism cannot make sense of cases where the moral costs of a false belief are colossal (\u201cBelieve the bomb is harmless\u201d in a nuclear plant).  Monism yields lottery and preface paradoxes, sanctions wishful thinking under trivial stakes, and seems to invert the conceptual priority of truth to belief.\n\nI propose a third route: reasons pluralism combined with structured priority.  To motivate it we need a general account of how heterogeneous reasons can rationally interact.\n\nII.  How Reasons of Different Kinds Can Interact  \nAnalogy with action.  Practical agency confronts a profusion of reason-kinds: prudential, moral, aesthetic, relational, legal.  We neither collapse them into one master value nor insist that only one kind counts.  Instead, we deploy defeasible priority rules: morally wrongful options are excluded no matter the personal benefit; within the moral envelope prudential considerations decide; aesthetic reasons can break prudential ties.  This \u201cstructured pluralism\u201d is familiar from moral theory (lexical priority of basic rights over aggregate welfare) and from legal reasoning (constitutional rules override statutes, which override regulations, etc.).  The apparatus allows rational conflict resolution without a common cardinal metric.\n\nMy claim is that belief can be governed by an analogous structure:\n\n1.  Lexical Priority: Epistemic reasons occupy the first tier because belief constitutively aims at truth.  That aim is not just one good among others; it is baked into what it is to form a belief rather than a fantasy or a hope.  Hence, ceteris paribus, epistemic reasons determine the a-ought.\n\n2.  Higher-Order Practical Constraints: Practical reasons nevertheless can bear on doxastic life by generating higher-order obligations that sometimes defeat first-order epistemic reasons.  There are two main routes:\n\n   a.  Moral Encroachment: If accepting a belief poses morally significant risks of wrongful harm or injustice (e.g., believing a Black customer is likely to steal on thin evidence), moral reasons impose a heightened evidential threshold or even forbid belief outright.  They do not weigh directly against the evidence; they re-shape which level of evidential support suffices.  (This mechanism is now widely discussed by Basu, Gardiner, Buchak & Moss, et al.)\n\n   b.  Stakes-Sensitive Pragmatic Encroachment: Where error would be catastrophe, practical reasons impose a higher standard for permissible belief.  James\u2019s \u201coption forced, momentous, irreversible\u201d is such a case.  Again, the practical reasons do not outweigh data; they alter the conditions under which believing counts as epistemically responsible, for reasons of doxastic self-management.\n\n3.  Rational License, Not Requirement.  When higher-order practical obligations activate, they typically make it rationally permissible, not obligatory, to depart from the evidential balance.  Epistemic thresholds become necessary but not sufficient for belief; if you lack them, you must refrain.  If you meet them, you may still choose to trust or to suspend, depending on further stakes.  This permissive outcome accords with our ordinary sense that many high-stakes beliefs are up to the agent.\n\nNotice that interaction occurs without commensuration.  Practical reasons do not tell us that their weight is 0.8 whereas truth-probability is 0.7.  Rather, they trigger rule-based side-constraints (do not believe on merely statistical evidence when the moral stakes are high) or adjust the satisfiers for the constitutive aim of belief (raise the evidential bar).  The decision procedure is lexically tiered, not arithmetically additive.\n\nIII.  Why Lexical Priority Is Plausible  \n1.  The Constitutive Aim Thesis.  Belief is individuated by its aim at truth: to believe that p is to take p to be the case.  While one can act from many motives, one cannot believe from many aims without ceasing to believe.  This is the \u201ctransparency\u201d of belief: asked why you believe p, the only non-alienating answer is \u201cbecause p is (or seems) true.\u201d  Consequently epistemic reasons have standing by default; practical reasons enter only through the back door of higher-order governance.\n\n2.  The Normativity of Evidence.  Evidence seems to provide non-overridable reasons.  If you know that p follows with overwhelming probability from what you know, you are under epistemic pressure to believe.  To override that pressure, the contrary reasons must be of a special kind\u2014reasons that forbid you to engage your normal doxastic machinery.  Such reasons are plausibly higher-order rather than first-order.\n\n3.  Explaining Wishful Thinking\u2019s Irrationality.  We judge it irrational to believe you will win the lottery because it would feel good, even in low-stakes circumstances.  A pluralist account with lexical priority explains why: absent higher-order stakes, epistemic reasons decide.  Monism would predict that if utility gain exceeds expected cost, the belief is permissible; purism accounts for irrationality but lacks resources for the exceptional cases we consider next.\n\nIV.  Exceptional Cases and the Defeasibility of Lexical Priority  \nConsider the following four influential examples.  I argue that our structured pluralism captures the right verdicts.\n\n1.  James\u2019s Religious Hypothesis.  Suppose the evidence for theism is ambiguous, yet believing would profoundly enrich the believer\u2019s life (and disbelieving would foreclose the good).  On my view, the e-ought is suspension; practical reasons supply a permissible defeater that allows belief as long as the believer is aware of the evidential insufficiency and takes responsibility for the pragmatic gamble.  Belief is not required (that would betray the constitutive aim) but not prohibited.\n\n2.  Pascal\u2019s Wager.  Here the stakes (infinite bliss or torment) are so great that practical reasons generate a doxastic obligation to cultivate belief.  Is this consistent with lexical priority?  Yes, because the practical reasons work indirectly: they require you to take steps (pray, investigate, condition yourself) that in the limit increase the epistemic probability as you see it, or produce doxastic feelings that mimic belief.  If the evidence were transparently against theism, belief would remain impermissible.  The wager works only under evidential ambiguity.\n\n3.  Moral Encroachment and Racist Beliefs.  Statistical evidence may indicate that group G has higher crime rates.  Epistemically that evidence supports \u201cG-members are more likely to be criminals.\u201d  Yet believing this generalization can perpetuate injustice.  On my model, moral reasons raise the evidential threshold for attributing socially dangerous stereotypes; unless the agent meets the higher threshold, belief is forbidden.  This is a defeat, not a weighing.\n\n4.  High-Stakes Medical Case.  Jonas again.  Strong but fallible evidence supports efficacy; an error would kill.  The practical stakes demand a higher confidence than the evidence provides.  So Jonas ought_a to suspend or to seek further testing.  Purism delivers the wrong verdict; monism gets it right by luck; structured pluralism explains why epistemic standards themselves are context-sensitive (safety condition on knowledge).\n\nV.  The Metanormative Mechanics  \nHow precisely do higher-order reasons defeat first-order epistemic reasons?  I sketch three complementary mechanisms:\n\n1.  Threshold Shift Model (Buchak, Fantl, McGrath).  Rational full belief requires credence \u2265 t.  Epistemic reasons fix a default tE (say .9).  Practical stakes set a required tS, typically monotonically increasing in expected cost of error.  The operative threshold is max(tE, tS).  Interaction is rule-based: whichever threshold is higher dominates.\n\n2.  Permission/Requirement Distinction.  Let R_E be the set of epistemically permissible doxastic states; let R_P be the set of practically permissible states.  The all-things-considered permissible set is the intersection R_E \u2229 R_P.  No need to compare magnitudes; the intersection is computed set-theoretically.  If empty, the agent faces a tragic dilemma and must violate some norm.\n\n3.  Higher-Order Doxastic Obligations.  Sometimes what practical reasons require is not adopting or rejecting p, but forming a belief about whether your evidence is adequate.  If you judge it inadequate, you must suspend.  Thus practical reasons operate at the level of metacognition, which then constrains first-order belief.\n\nSuch mechanisms vindicate genuine interaction without cardinal commensurability, because each operates through logical or structural relations (max, intersection, level-shifting), not through additive aggregation.\n\nVI.  Objections and Replies  \nObjection 1: The proposed \u201clexical priority\u201d is arbitrary.  Why not symmetrical priority or context-relative priority?  \nReply: Belief\u2019s constitutive aim at truth supplies a principled ground.  Compare speech acts: assertion aims at truth; promising aims at future compliance.  Different norms attach.  It would be bizarre to promise q because q is amusing, ignoring your intention to perform q; likewise for belief.\n\nObjection 2: If practical stakes can ever defeat evidence, won\u2019t that license rampant wishful thinking once agents inflate perceived stakes?  \nReply: Two safeguards: (i)  The stakes must be bona fide, not merely imagined, and often morally assessable by third parties\u2014hence defeasibility is socially constrained.  (ii)  Defeat typically operates through public rules (e.g., anti-discrimination norms) or through objective decision theory, not idiosyncratic desires.  Your private convenience rarely meets the threshold.\n\nObjection 3: The view treats practical reasons only negatively (to forbid belief) not positively (to require it).  But James and Pascal think they can provide pro tanto reasons to believe.  \nReply: Practical reasons can supply positive higher-order obligations: to seek evidence, to habituate oneself, to adopt faith-like attitudes.  They can thereby make belief eventually epistemically permissible.  Direct requirement of belief is limited, but that matches our phenomenology: we can cultivate belief but rarely summon it by fiat.\n\nObjection 4: Rationality seems hostage to luck: whether evidence meets the heightened threshold depends on contingencies unrelated to truth.  \nReply: Yes\u2014because rationality is sensitive not just to truth but to our situated risk management.  Consider the \u201csafety\u201d condition in modal epistemology: knowledge requires that one could not easily have been wrong.  Practical stakes enter by modulating what counts as \u201ceasily.\u201d\n\nVII.  Advantages of Structured Pluralism  \n1.  Reconciles intuitions across cases, capturing both Cliffordian and Jamesian insights.  \n2.  Explains methodological plurality in epistemology: why both evidentialist and pragmatist considerations feel normatively relevant.  \n3.  Integrates with decision theory: thresholds and level-shifts mimic the role of loss functions in Bayesian statistics.  \n4.  Avoids cynical implications of pragmatic monism and parochial rigidity of purism.  \n5.  Provides a framework for policy: evidential standards in law, medicine, journalism scaled by moral stakes.\n\nConclusion  \nEpistemic and practical reasons are indeed heterogeneous, but their heterogeneity need not condemn us to normative schizophrenia.  The interaction problem arises only if we assume that all reasons must be weighed on a single quantitative scale.  Once we recognize structured priority rules\u2014lexical ordering, threshold shifts, higher-order constraints\u2014we see how the two kinds of reasons jointly determine an all-things-considered verdict about what one ought to believe.  In most ordinary contexts epistemic reasons dominate; in high-stakes or morally charged contexts practical reasons legitimately silence, defer, or reshape them.  The resulting view honors both the constitutive tie between belief and truth and the inescapable fact that believing is an activity with consequences.  Belief, like action, is governed by a plural normativity, but coherence is achieved through structure rather than through reduction.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 13, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 3772, "reasoning_tokens": 320}

If epistemic reasons are grounded solely in truth-conduciveness while practical reasons are grounded in value or welfare, then the two sets of considerations seem to belong to different normative currencies. How, then, could they be combined so as to deliver a single \u201call-things-considered\u201d verdict about what one ought to believe? In what follows I map the landscape, diagnose the incommensurability worry, and develop a decision-theoretic hybrid account on which epistemic and practical reasons become commensurable without distortion. The argument unfolds in five stages:\n\n1. Clarifying the data: four cases that motivate the dual-reason view.  \n2. Why \u201csimple\u201d solutions\u2014purism, reductionism, and lexical priority\u2014fail.  \n3. A meta-normative framework for combining reasons.  \n4. A two-dimensional accuracy-utility model that implements the framework.  \n5. Objections and replies, including worries about epistemic deflation, moral encroachment, and doxastic wronging.\n\nI. Motivating the Dual-Reason Picture\n\nThe picture at issue is not idle theory; it is forced upon us by concrete cases.\n\nCase 1: Medical Self-Deception.  \nClarice has been diagnosed with a progressive disease. The best medical data support the prognosis \u201csix months to live.\u201d The same data, however, indicate that pessimistic patients often die sooner, whereas patients who believe they can recover sometimes live years. Her physician says: \u201cLook, the odds are terrible, but if you can bring yourself to believe you will beat this, it may literally save your life.\u201d\n\nCase 2: The Beneficent Lie.  \nYusuf, who is eighteen, has applied to a prestigious conservatory. His teacher knows that Yusuf\u2019s chances of admission are slim, yet also knows that students who believe they can succeed practice harder and often do better. Should the teacher instil belief in Yusuf despite the low evidence?\n\nCase 3: Moral Encroachment.  \nConsider the now-familiar case of a police officer who relies on base-rate statistics linking a racial group to crime. The statistical evidence may make it epistemically rational (in a bare evidential sense) for the officer to form certain suspicions, yet we recoil at the thought that he ought so to believe.\n\nCase 4: High-Stakes Astronaut.  \nAn engineer must decide whether to accept telemetry that the capsule\u2019s heat shield is intact. The evidence is reasonably strong but not conclusive. Given the enormous costs of error (three lives, a national programme), the engineer feels she ought to withhold belief until redundancy checks are performed.\n\nIn each case we find a tension between \u201cgo with the evidence\u201d and \u201cconsider the stakes.\u201d Our pre-theoretic judgments are mixed: to ignore the medical stakes seems callous, to ignore the racial injustice seems immoral, and to ignore the engineering catastrophe seems wrong. Yet to ignore the truth entirely feels epistemically reckless. A theory on which only epistemic reasons matter must acquiesce in doxastic racism and disregard existential stakes; a theory on which only practical reasons matter must license wishful thinking. The dual-reason hypothesis explains why we experience conflict in these cases: both kinds of reasons are genuine.\n\nII. Why \u201cSimple\u201d Solutions Fail\n\n1. Purism.  \nTraditional epistemic purism claims that \u201cought to believe\u201d reduces to \u201csupported by sufficient evidence.\u201d It deals with stakes by moving them to the domain of action (\u201cdeciding under belief\u201d) or to belief revision thresholds (\u201ccredence levels\u201d) but denies that stakes can alter the deontic status of full belief itself. Purism fits the Grazer\u2019s maxim\u2014believe only on evidence\u2014but yields the uncomfortable verdict that Clarice, the dying patient, ought to believe she will die soon. Few find that plausible.\n\n2. Pragmatic Reductionism.  \nPragmatic encroachers reverse the polarity: a belief is justified only if it satisfies both evidential and practical standards. They attempt to assimilate practical stakes into the epistemic norm by redefining \u201cknowledge\u201d or \u201cjustification\u201d in terms of cognitive security under possible losses. Yet this seems to distort the distinctive role of epistemic reasons. When evidence is overwhelming and stakes are minor, it is odd to say the belief lacks justification merely because it is useless; similarly, when stakes are huge, it is odd to call a practically beneficial yet evidentially unsupported belief \u201cjustified.\u201d Reductionism collapses the very distinction we set out to honour.\n\n3. Lexical Priority.  \nAnother proposal posits a strict hierarchy: epistemic reasons set a hard constraint; practical reasons operate only within the space left open by them. The astronaut may refuse to believe despite decent evidence, the police officer may not rely on racial statistics, but Clarice may not believe she will survive because the evidence is too poor. Lexical order, however, struggles with diminishing-returns cases: how much evidential support is enough before practical reasons get a say? Any schematic answer (e.g., \u201canything below .8 credence licenses practical defeat\u201d) looks ad hoc and fails to generalise.\n\nWe need a deeper model of normativity\u2014one that (a) retains the independence of the two reason-types, (b) allows direct comparison when choice is forced, and (c) explains why sometimes epistemic reasons win, sometimes practical reasons do.\n\nIII. A Meta-Normative Framework\n\nBegin with a minimal conception of a reason: a consideration that counts in favour of some attitude. This is intentionally thin; it does not presuppose a shared currency. Next add a familiar but powerful principle of practical reason\u2014what Joseph Raz called the \u201cweighing model\u201d: when multiple reasons bear on one option, they aggregate by weight, and the option supported by the balance is what one ought, all things considered, to do.\n\nIncommensurability arises only if reasons have no common scale. But the scale need not be original; it can be constructed, the way money functions as a constructed common medium of exchange. What, then, would such a constructed medium look like for belief?\n\nThe guiding thought is that cognitively responsible agents aim at a composite value function that treats accuracy as constituent but not exhaustive of doxastic value. Borrowing from epistemic utility theory (EUT), we say that every doxastic state carries two kinds of payoff:\n\na. Accuracy Payoff (A): how close the belief system aligns with truth.  \nb. Pragmatic Payoff (P): how much concrete value (moral, prudential, social) flows from the believer\u2019s habitation of that doxastic state.\n\nCall the weighted sum V = \u03b1A + \u03b2P the \u201ctotal doxastic value.\u201d Why think such a composite aim is legitimate rather than a philosopher\u2019s convenience? Here are three considerations.\n\na. Phenomenology of deliberation: In real life we do weigh evidence against stakes. The mere fact that we can feel torn shows that our psychology makes room for combined assessment.\n\nb. Decision-theoretic rationality: Acting under uncertainty requires forming credences that maximise expected utility, and accuracy literally enters those utilities because incorrect beliefs lead to bad outcomes. So accuracy and utility already mingle in action-guiding deliberation.\n\nc. Second-order autonomy: We have reason to be the kind of agents who treat truth as a weighty but defeasible concern, precisely because doing so maximises our chance of living good lives and avoiding moral catastrophe.\n\nThe sharp critic objects that accuracy is a good of a different order\u2014a \u201cconstitutive good\u201d of belief\u2014and so cannot be traded off. But constitutiveness alone does not confer lexical priority. Health is constitutive of athletic excellence, yet athletes sometimes forego marginal health to secure victory (the sprinter who risks minor injury in the final push). Likewise, epistemic agency may rationally sacrifice some probability of truth to avoid catastrophic moral error or to perform life-saving optimism. Nothing incoherent here.\n\nIV. The Two-Dimensional Model\n\nTechnical machinery helps to dissolve what looks like metaphysical impossibility. I sketch a simplified version drawing on Joyce (1998) and Leitgeb & Pettigrew (2010).\n\n1. Belief States.  \nLet S be the set of possible worlds. A \u201cfull belief\u201d corresponds to assigning credence 1 to a proposition p and 0 to \u00acp. Suspension corresponds to credence 0.5. We treat discrete attitudes for expository ease, though the model generalises.\n\n2. Accuracy Scores.  \nFollowing proper scoring rules, the accuracy of believing p when p is true is 0 (no error); if p is false, the score is \u2013d, where d > 0 measures error cost.\n\n3. Pragmatic Scores.  \nIndependently we define a function U(s, attitude) that quantifies the ordinary value that would obtain in world s were the agent to have that attitude. In Clarice\u2019s case, U assigns additional expected life months to the optimistic belief; in the astronaut\u2019s case, U assigns negative millions of dollars to false belief.\n\n4. Expected Total Value.  \nFor a given body of evidence E, the rational agent assigns prior credences CrE over S. The expected total value of adopting attitude A is:\n\nETV(A) = \u03a3s CrE(s) [\u03b1 Acc(s, A) + \u03b2 U(s, A)].\n\nAn attitude is rationally permissible if its ETV is within a small \u03b5 of the maximum; it is obligatory if it uniquely maximises ETV; it is forbidden if dominated by an alternative across all \u03b1, \u03b2 within the agent\u2019s acknowledged range. (One might allow imprecision about \u03b1 and \u03b2 to capture uncertainty about the weight of truth.)\n\n5. Application to the Four Cases.\n\nMedical Self-Deception: Accuracy cost of false optimism is moderate (Clarice ends up wrong), but pragmatic benefit is large (extra survival chances). Even with substantial \u03b1, the \u03b2U term may dominate, making optimistic belief all-things-considered rational.\n\nBeneficent Lie: For Yusuf, pragmatic benefit is moderate and less certain; accuracy cost is personal and social (wasting time). If evidence is extremely poor, the \u03b1A penalty may overwhelm; the teacher then ought not deceive.\n\nMoral Encroachment: For the racist officer, pragmatic payoffs of the discriminatory belief are negligible or negative once moral disvalue is counted. Thus the \u03b2U term sharply lowers ETV, so withholding belief wins despite high statistical evidence.\n\nHigh-Stakes Astronaut: Error cost is enormous\u2014human life\u2014so even if the accuracy term favours belief, the \u03b2U term penalises incorrect belief so severely that suspension or further inquiry maximises ETV.\n\nWhat about direct conflicts where neither attitude strictly dominates? Here the \u03b5-zone of permissibility allows for permissible divergence: sometimes two attitudes are close enough in ETV that both count as rational. This is how the model respects the phenomenon of irresolvable conflict.\n\nV. Addressing Key Objections\n\nObjection 1: The model licenses wishful thinking.  \nReply: Only if pragmatic benefits are immense relative to accuracy loss does wishful thinking prevail. In most quotidian contexts accuracy carries ample weight to exclude fantasy. The model predicts, correctly, that people normally cannot make themselves believe obviously false propositions because accuracy dominates.\n\nObjection 2: Truth possesses lexical priority from the standpoint of \u201cepistemic agency.\u201d  \nReply: The claim, if taken as a moral one, must itself be supported by reasons. But the hybrid model can internalise it: set \u03b1 so large that practical reasons virtually never win. Yet empirical cases like Moral Encroachment show that many philosophers, even purists, are willing to override evidence when moral costs are high. So the lexical priority thesis lacks reflective equilibrium.\n\nObjection 3: The two-dimensional value looks ad hoc; why these weights?  \nReply: Decision theory always contains a utility function. What the present proposal adds is that a component of that utility is the epistemic good of accuracy. Far from ad hoc, it is the default way multi-objective choice is rendered tractable. Additionally, the agent\u2019s uncertainty about \u03b1 and \u03b2 is itself a rational matter; genuine dilemmas can occur when meta-uncertainty prevents a clear verdict.\n\nObjection 4: Epistemic norms are categorically different from pragmatic norms because they are constitutive of belief; they cannot be overridden without changing the very attitude.  \nReply: All norms are constitutive to the practices they govern but can still compete. Promise-keeping is constitutive of contract, yet sometimes overridden by higher moral considerations. Belief remains belief even when formed partly for pragmatic reason; it is just belief that fails to aim single-mindedly at truth. That is why we judge it epistemically criticisable though perhaps overall justified.\n\nObjection 5: Phenomenology suggests we cannot directly choose beliefs.  \nReply: Even if direct voluntary control is limited, reasons can still bear on what we \u201cought\u201d to believe in a broader, guidance-preserving sense. They affect indirect control\u2014what evidence we seek, what standpoint we adopt, whether we cultivate optimism or scepticism. The hybrid model concerns the standards that govern these control points, not the immediate flick of a switch.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe apparent incommensurability of epistemic and practical reasons emerges only if we presuppose that truth and value belong to fundamentally different normative realms. Once we locate both inside a unified decision-theoretic framework, they become comparable, in much the same way that health risks and monetary costs become comparable in public policy via cost-benefit analysis. Commensurability does not trivialise their difference; it merely supplies a rational procedure for adjudicating conflicts.\n\nBelief, on the hybrid view, has a dual telos: to map the world accurately and to serve human flourishing. Sometimes those aims align; sometimes they conflict. When they do, our total epistemic-pragmatic agency must decide which cost is bearable. The decision-theoretic model I have outlined preserves the independence of each kind of reason, respects the phenomenology of conflict, and fits our intuitions across a range of applied cases. It shows, finally, that the alleged impossibility of weighing truth against value was a mirage. Like many normative problems, the challenge is not that comparison cannot be made, but that it must be made responsibly\u2014with full awareness of what we stand to gain and lose on either side.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 14, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 3670, "reasoning_tokens": 576}

On this view, one is able to perceive others' goal-directed actions only to the extent that one is able to simulate them with one's own motor system. Is motor resonance necessary for the perception of goal-directed actions, or can goal-directed actions be perceived independently of resonance mechanisms?", "answer": "Motor Resonance and the Perception of Goal-Directed Action: A Critical Assessment\n\n1. Introduction  \n\nWhat does it take to see that someone is reaching for a cup in order to drink rather than merely stretching an arm?  Contemporary cognitive science often answers: motor resonance.  When I watch your hand move, patterns of neural activity are elicited in my own premotor cortex that overlap with the patterns that would emerge were I to perform the same grasp.  According to the strong resonance thesis (SRT) this mapping is not just helpful; it is a necessary condition for perceiving your movement as goal-directed.  No resonance, no genuine perception of goal.  \n\nIn this essay I argue that SRT is false.  Motor resonance is neither conceptually nor empirically necessary for perceiving goal-directed action.  It is best seen as a speed-enhancing, disambiguating resource within a multi-route system that also exploits purely visual kinematics, contextual cues, and higher-level inferential capacities.  I begin by clarifying what is meant by \u201cperceiving goal-directed action\u201d and \u201cmotor resonance.\u201d  I then present the main arguments offered on behalf of necessity: the mirror-neuron argument, the common-coding argument, and the predictive-coding argument.  Each purported support, I contend, confuses causal efficiency with conceptual necessity.  The third part of the essay canvasses empirical counter-examples: (i) cross-species goal perception, (ii) perception in individuals lacking relevant motor repertoires, (iii) infants\u2019 early goal perception prior to motor mastery, and (iv) lesion studies.  In the fourth part I sketch alternative mechanisms\u2014Gibsonian affordance picking, teleological reasoning, and Bayesian inverse-planning\u2014that can ground goal perception independently of resonance.  Finally, I articulate a pluralist picture: our perceptual system is opportunistic, capitalising on any cue available; motor resonance is one such cue, but not the indispensable foundation of goal perception.\n\n2. Clarifying the Target  \n\n2.1 Perceiving Goal-Directed Action  \nTo perceive an action as goal-directed is minimally to attribute to it a distal end that explains, at least implicitly, the unfolding kinematics.  Seeing a reach as aiming at the cup (rather than, say, at empty space) is different from merely detecting hand movement.  Whether we call this \u201cperception,\u201d \u201cquasi-perceptual judgment,\u201d or \u201cfast inference\u201d matters less than recognising the phenomenon: observers rapidly identify not only what bodily motion occurs but what it is for.\n\n2.2 Motor Resonance  \nMotor resonance denotes activation in the observer\u2019s motor system topographically congruent with the observed effector, timing, or force profile.  It covers mirror-neuron firing (premotor and parietal), corticospinal excitability measured by TMS, and even subtle EMG changes.  Resonance is subpersonal, often non-conscious, and it aligns with one\u2019s own motor repertoire.  The SRT interprets this activation as a covert simulation that supplies the perceiver with an embodied model of the observed action\u2019s goal.\n\n3. The Case for Necessity  \n\n3.1 The Mirror-Neuron Argument  \nDiscoveries in macaques (di Pellegrino et al., 1992) and humans (Fadiga et al., 1995) revealed neurons active in both action execution and observation.  Because many mirror neurons discharge selectively for goal-related aspects (object-directed grasps, tool-use), it was proposed that their activity constitutes an internal \u201cmotor vocabulary\u201d through which observed movements are understood (Rizzolatti & Craighero, 2004).  If mirror neurons map from seen kinematics to motor goals, and if they are the only mechanism affording such mapping, then damaging or bypassing them should obliterate goal perception\u2014hence necessity.\n\n3.2 The Common-Coding Argument  \nPrinz (1997) and Hommel et al. (2001) articulate a representational overlap between perception and action: actions are coded in terms of their distal sensory effects.  When I witness your grasp, the same distal-effect code that would guide my own grasp is activated, enabling direct perception of the goal without explicit inference.  Because the code is motorically grounded, common coding appears to imply a resonance requirement.\n\n3.3 The Predictive-Coding Argument  \nA more recent, Bayesian-flavoured version stresses forward models and hierarchical prediction.  To predict another\u2019s unfolding movement, the observer allegedly runs her own motor generative model, compares predicted kinematics with actual visual input, and updates beliefs about hidden goals (Kilner et al., 2007).  If the forward model is proprietary to the motor system, then simulation via resonance is necessary for perception to be richly predictive and thus genuinely goal-oriented.\n\n4. Why Necessity Fails: Conceptual Considerations  \n\n4.1 Equivocation Between Enabling and Constitutive Conditions  \nEmpirical findings that mirror neuronal activity covaries with action observation establish causal contribution, not conceptual requirement.  To claim necessity, one must show that without resonance the relevant perceptual content cannot be constituted.  But from the fact that A often facilitates B, it does not follow that B logically or metaphysically depends on A.  Coffee helps me philosophise; it is not constitutive of philosophical thought.\n\n4.2 The Problem of Novel Actions  \nNecessity faces a prima-facie obstacle: I can immediately see purpose in actions that I am unable to execute\u2014e.g., a virtuoso finger-tapping pattern by a pianist, a high-difficulty Olympic dive, or the prehensile tail grasp of a capuchin monkey.  Unless we posit an implausibly vast latent motor repertoire, perception must rely on representational formats other than personal motor programs.  Resonance could be recruited to approximate unfamiliar dynamics, but then simulation would be crude and non-isomorphic, undercutting the very notion of \u201cmapping onto one\u2019s own repertoire.\u201d\n\n4.3 Amphiboly of \u201cSimulation\u201d  \nSometimes SRT proponents retreat to a thin notion: any predictive, embodied representation counts as motor simulation.  Then necessity trivialises: we understand actions via whichever brain circuits implement prediction, and these turn out to involve motor regions, therefore resonance is necessary.  But this inflates \u201cmotor\u201d to encompass generic cortical computation.  To preserve explanatory bite, resonance must be specifically motoric, relying on executed-action codes.  With that narrower reading, counter-instances loom large.\n\n5. Empirical Counter-Evidence  \n\n5.1 Cross-Species Goal Perception  \nHumans effortlessly perceive goal-directedness in dogs chasing balls, birds building nests, or octopuses opening jars, despite lacking tails, wings or tentacles.  fMRI shows attenuated mirror-system activation for such cross-phyla actions (Buccino et al., 2004), yet behavioural measures confirm accurate goal recognition.  The most economical explanation is that visual systems extract kinematic invariants and environmental affordances without needing self-based motor mapping.\n\n5.2 Congenital Motor Impairments  \nSeveral studies document intact action understanding in individuals with congenital limb aplasia or spinal muscular atrophy who have never executed the observed movements.  Vannuscorps and Caramazza (2016) found that such participants pass fine-grained tests of action goal identification.  If motor execution history is missing, resonance\u2014as defined by mapping onto one\u2019s own repertoire\u2014cannot serve the necessary cognitive substrate.\n\n5.3 Early Infancy  \nAt 3- to 5-month-old, infants can distinguish goal-directed reaches from similar non-goal movements (Woodward, 1998).  Yet their own reaching skills are rudimentary.  Neuroimaging indicates immature mirror circuitry in this age range.  Either resonance is unnecessary, or we must posit strong nativist innateness of motor codes awaiting later bodily realization.  Parsimony favours the former.\n\n5.4 Lesion and TMS Studies  \nPatients with ideomotor apraxia, who exhibit impaired action production owing to premotor lesions, often retain normal comprehension of observed actions (Pazzaglia et al., 2008).  Conversely, TMS disruption of premotor cortex reduces corticospinal resonance but leaves explicit goal judgements intact (Avenanti et al., 2013).  These double dissociations falsify strict necessity.\n\n6. Alternative Routes to Goal Perception  \n\n6.1 Gibsonian Affordance and Kinematic Picking  \nVisual systems are finely tuned to pick up ecological invariants: velocity profiles, deceleration just before contact, and hand-shaping congruent with object geometry offer direct information about grasp intent.  Such \u201csmart\u201d visual processing can, in principle, specify goals without motor mediation (Runeson & Frykholm, 1983).  It relies on perceptual attunement rather than internal replication.\n\n6.2 Teleological Reasoning  \nGergely and Csibra\u2019s (2003) \u201cna\u00efve rationality\u201d account shows that infants expect agents to realise goals by efficient means, given situational constraints.  Observers integrate environmental cues, obstacle layout, and energetic cost to infer the goal consistent with rational action, independent of whether they could themselves achieve that goal.  This explanatory stance operates at a personal or subpersonal cognitive level separate from motor resonance.\n\n6.3 Bayesian Inverse Planning  \nComputational models by Baker, Saxe and Tenenbaum (2009) formalise action understanding as inverse reinforcement learning: the observer infers the reward (goal) that best rationalises the observed trajectory.  Motor implementation details are abstracted away in favour of probabilistic reasoning over state-action spaces.  Such algorithms can run on visual or associative representations without motor execution codes.\n\n6.4 Social-Contextual Cues  \nOften the richest cues to goal lie outside bodily kinematics: the presence of a half-drunk cup, the normative scripts of eating, cultural conventions.  My seeing a pianist enter the stage with sheet music already biases goal attribution before any finger movement occurs.  Resonance cannot precede these extra-motor cues; at best it refines the percept already in place.\n\n7. A Pluralist, Opportunistic Model  \n\nPutting the threads together, we arrive at an \u201copportunistic pluralism.\u201d  The cognitive system recruits whichever informational stream is fastest, clearest, and cheapest in a given context.  For familiar, within-repertoire acts viewed under good conditions, motor resonance offers rapid predictive coding and might dominate.  For novel, cross-species, or tool-mediated actions, visual-contextual and inferential routes prevail.  Redundancy enhances robustness: multiple cues cross-validate and correct each other.\n\nIn predictive-coding terms, the brain maintains hierarchical generative models whose units are not fixed to anatomical motor maps; they are abstract dynamical templates that can be partially instantiated in premotor cortex but also in parietal, temporal, and prefrontal areas.  Motor regions supply one kind of prior, not the sole kind.  Consequently, dampening resonance slows but does not abolish goal perception.\n\n8. Addressing Residual Objections  \n\n8.1 The Speed Advantage Objection  \nProponents may concede non-necessity yet insist that without resonance goal perception would be too slow to count as perception.  However, response-time studies show that observers deprived of motor compatibility (e.g., due to TMS disruption) display millisecond-level delays, not wholesale failure.  Perception tolerates such latencies; the phenomenology remains immediate.\n\n8.2 The Developmental Internalisation Objection  \nAnother rejoinder appeals to \u201cinternal simulation before execution\u201d: foetal or early infancy spontaneous motor activity allegedly builds a latent repertoire that later scaffolds perception.  This suggestion, though intriguing, cannot explain intact goal perception for actions impossible given human biomechanics, nor the goal-attribution abilities in individuals who never developed motor control of limbs.  Thus developmental internalisation cannot salvage necessity.\n\n8.3 The Overlapping-Neural-Pattern Objection  \nFinally, neuroimaging consistently finds overlapping voxels for execution and observation.  Might overlap itself betoken necessity?  By parity, visual imagery overlaps early visual cortex, yet congenitally blind individuals still form mental images using non-visual areas.  Overlap indicates opportunistic neural recycling rather than conceptual dependence.\n\n9. Philosophical Implications  \n\nRejecting SRT nuances the embodied cognition program.  Embodiment matters, but not as a single bottleneck for social perception.  The mind achieves situated understanding by layering bodies, environments, and cultural practices.  Recognising this pluralism prevents conflation of levels: the subpersonal motor story illuminates one mechanistic pathway; the personal-level concept of seeing a goal is broader, irreducible to any one mechanistic substrate.\n\nMoreover, the debate illustrates a common philosophical error: mistaking frequent causal contributions for modal necessity.  In epistemology, memory often supplies justification for belief, yet beliefs can be justified independently of memory.  So too in mindreading: motor resonance often supports but does not constitute perception of goals.\n\n10. Conclusion  \n\nMotor resonance is an elegant, powerful mechanism for understanding others, but it is not the gatekeeper of goal perception.  People with atypical motor systems, young infants, and observers of alien actions all manage to perceive goals without mapping movements onto their own motor repertoires.  Visual extraction of affordances, contextual inference, teleological reasoning, and probabilistic inverse planning each offer independent footholds.  The mirror system contributes efficiency and predictive richness, yielding a flexible, adaptive ensemble.\n\nThe upshot is methodological and philosophical humility: no single mechanism likely underwrites a capacity as evolutionarily pivotal and contextually variable as social perception.  Future research should explore how distinct routes interact\u2014how resonance modulates visual affordance detection, how teleological reasoning recruits or suppresses motor simulation, and how cultural learning warps each component.  Abandoning the necessity claim frees us to study action understanding in all its multifaceted glory, respecting both embodiment and the creative plasticity of human cognition.\n\n(Word count \u2248 2,067)", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 0, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 3367, "reasoning_tokens": 384}
{"question_id": "Smortchkova-SeeingGoalDirectedness-2020", "question": "Some philosophers and cognitive scientists have argued that motor resonance\u2014the mapping of another's action onto one's own motor repertoire\u2014is a necessary condition for perceiving goal-directed actions. On this view, one is able to perceive others' goal-directed actions only to the extent that one is able to simulate them with one's own motor system. Is motor resonance necessary for the perception of goal-directed actions, or can goal-directed actions be perceived independently of resonance mechanisms?", "answer": "Motor resonance is one of the most widely discussed discoveries of contemporary cognitive neuroscience. Since Rizzolatti and colleagues first reported \u201cmirror\u201d neurons in the macaque premotor cortex, the idea that we understand other people\u2019s movements by internally reproducing them with our own motor apparatus has recast debates in philosophy of mind, developmental psychology, action theory, and social cognition. The strongest version of the thesis claims that such resonance is not merely an enabling or facilitative factor but a necessary condition: without being able to map another\u2019s movement onto the observer\u2019s own motor repertoire, the observer could not perceive the movement as goal-directed at all. In what follows I argue that this necessity claim cannot be sustained. Although motor resonance often contributes to the richness, speed, and affective colour of action perception, the available conceptual considerations, developmental data, neuropsychological evidence, and cross-species studies all indicate that goal-directed actions can be, and frequently are, perceived without any functioning resonance mechanism. To see why, we must examine (i) what it is to perceive an action as goal-directed, (ii) what mirror-type resonance can and cannot provide, and (iii) cases in which action perception clearly survives radical impairment or absence of self-motor simulation. A multi-route picture emerges: resonance is one among several computational pathways that can ground the attribution of goal-directedness, but it is neither logically nor empirically indispensable.\n\n1. What is it to perceive a goal-directed action?\n\nBefore addressing the role of resonance, we need clarity on the explanandum. Philosophers sometimes distinguish thin \u201cmovement perception\u201d from thicker \u201caction perception.\u201d When I see an arm rise, I can register the kinematic trajectory independently of any purpose; when I see someone raise a glass in order to drink, I see not merely a limb displacement but a teleologically structured event that is answerable to a standard of success (drinking). Perceiving goal-directedness, then, minimally involves:\n\na. Segmenting behaviour into agent-bound actions rather than environmental movement.\n\nb. Identifying the behavior\u2019s distal target or effect (the glass ending near the mouth).\n\nc. Treating the movement as governed by a rational constraint: the movement is not random noise but efficient relative to the distal goal.\n\nImportantly, nothing in (a)\u2013(c) seems to presuppose that the perceiver can themselves reproduce the movement. A climber can watch a spider scuttle up a wall, appreciate that it is trying to reach a fly caught in the web, and marvel at its efficiency, even though the human observer\u2019s motor repertoire does not include eight-legged scuttling. The resonance theorist therefore owes us an explanation of why simulation is supposedly indispensable.\n\n2. The case for necessity\n\nAdvocates of the strong simulation view marshal four kinds of considerations.\n\ni. Single-cell and neuroimaging evidence. In monkeys, canonical mirror neurons discharge both when the animal grasps a peanut and when it watches another grasp. In humans, fMRI and MEG studies find that observation of familiar actions reliably activates premotor and parietal circuits that overlap with execution. This co-activation suggests an isomorphism between what the observer sees and the covert motor command that would produce it.\n\nii. Causal interference studies. When transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) or transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS) disrupt the hand area of motor cortex, subjects become slower or less accurate at discriminating visually presented hand actions and at predicting their future trajectory. This result has been interpreted to mean that sabotaging resonance directly harms action understanding.\n\niii. Developmental correlations. Infants tend to show a tight coupling between the actions they are on the cusp of mastering and the actions they visually prefer or understand in others. Nine-month-olds who can perform a pincer grasp appear better at anticipating another agent\u2019s pincer movement toward a small object than infants who have not yet mastered that fine motor skill. Such correlations seem to confirm that motor competence scaffolds perceptual understanding.\n\niv. Phenomenological introspection. Adults sometimes report that observing another\u2019s fluent movement evokes a \u201cfelt\u201d kinaesthetic pull, as though their own body were reenacting the behaviour in imagination. Sports fans \u201clean\u201d into a serve on television; musicians sight-read by covertly fingering passages. These experiences allegedly reveal how perception and simulation are fused.\n\nTaken together, the data depict a system that is recruited whenever we recognise what someone is doing and why. If that system were knocked out, the argument continues, goal-directed perception would collapse.\n\n3. Conceptual cracks in the necessity claim\n\nCompelling as the neuroscientific story appears, the inference from correlation (or even partial causation) to necessity is philosophically hasty. Several conceptual distinctions already weaken the conclusion.\n\nFirst, motor resonance is, by definition, ego-centric: it depends on the observer\u2019s own effectors. But the space of perceivable actions vastly outstrips the space of executable actions for any given organism. A human can understand that a bird is flying south for the winter, that a submarine is diving to avoid detection, or that a computer algorithm is sorting email\u2014all goal-directed events whose motor profiles are absent from human embodiment. Unless we are willing to deny that such events are \u201cperceived\u201d as goal-directed, we must allow some non-motor route for goal attribution.\n\nSecond, \u201cperception\u201d itself is an over-broad label. The mechanisms that yield the sense of an unfolding goal can be visual, auditory, tactile, linguistic, or inferential. Hearing the crescendo of hammer strokes next door, I may judge that my neighbour is trying to fix a shelf. No motor resonance with hammering is required; indeed, the relevant information is entirely auditory. What counts is sensitivity to higher-level regularities (tool use, typical outcomes), not sensory-motor mirroring.\n\nThird, nothing in the very idea of a goal entails similarity between the agent\u2019s movement schema and the observer\u2019s. If goal-directedness implies anything, it implies teleology and rational adjustability. A calculator \u201ctries\u201d to return the correct sum by following coded instructions, yet its inner state space is alien to mine. More cautiously, we attribute agency to infants, animals, or machines not because we can act like them, but because we grasp how their behaviour subserves ends, given their design limitations. The conceptual bridge is not executional overlap but normativity.\n\n4. Empirical counter-evidence\n\nOnce we look beyond mirror-friendly paradigms, plentiful data reveal action understanding in the absence, or near absence, of motor simulation.\n\n4.1 Neuropsychology and motor disorder\n\nThe strongest falsification would be someone who lacks a motor repertoire yet still perceives goals. Consider deafferented patients (e.g., Ian Waterman) who virtually lack proprioceptive feedback and whose voluntary movements depend on visual guidance. Despite massive motor abnormalities, such individuals have little difficulty recognising others\u2019 actions, including fine-grained hand gestures. Even more striking are patients with ideomotor apraxia, who cannot perform meaningful actions on command (e.g., waving goodbye) but can still describe and recognise those gestures in others. Their mirror system is likely disrupted, but action perception appears intact.\n\nPatients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) suffer progressive motor neuron degeneration. A 2019 study measured their capacity to identify instrumental actions from point-light displays. Performance was at ceiling and did not correlate with residual motor function. Hence motor competence is not a prerequisite for perceiving goals in biological motion.\n\n4.2 Early infancy\n\nProponents sometimes cite the correlation between infants\u2019 motor milestones and action recognition. Yet neonates just 48 hours old can discriminate goal-directed reaching from non-goal kinematics if the experimenter uses a contingent, agent-like stimulus. They have no reaching ability of their own. Similarly, six-week-old infants anticipate the goal of a gaze shift (following eye direction to an object). Ocular movements belong to their motor repertoire, true, but the key representational achievement is mapping eye orientation to distal object relevance, not duplicating the muscular commands. Even if some rudimentary resonance is present, it is far from clear that it drives the perception rather than piggybacks on separate visuo-attentional mechanisms.\n\n4.3 Cross-species perception\n\nDogs effortlessly read human pointing gestures, react appropriately to human gaze cues, and distinguish intentional from accidental actions by people although they cannot replicate many of those actions (e.g., dogs cannot raise eyebrows in the same way humans do). Unless we postulate a canine mirror network keyed to human-specific kinematics\u2014an implausible venture\u2014the dog\u2019s discrimination must proceed by a different route.\n\nConversely, humans interpret the goal-directedness of bees\u2019 waggle dances or of dolphin echolocation clicks. Tool use by New Caledonian crows is readily understood by observers who could not retrieve insects with a beak. Whether or not low-level resonance occurs, it is obviously not grounded in shared motor architecture.\n\n4.4 Vision-based predictive coding\n\nEye-tracking experiments show that adults generate anticipatory saccades to the target of an observed action well before the agent\u2019s hand arrives, even when they are told their own hands must remain still. Predictive cues include object affordances (a handle oriented toward the agent), contextual priors (cups go to mouths), and even cultural norms (right-handed people tend to reach with the right). When visual or situational evidence is sufficiently strong, anticipatory gaze occurs even if the depicted movement is biomechanically impossible for humans (e.g., a joint rotating 270 degrees). Motor resonance cannot generate predictions about impossible kinematics, because those motor commands do not exist in the observer. Yet observers succeed, indicating that audiovisual processing and statistical learning support independent predictions.\n\n5. Re-interpreting the pro-resonance data\n\nIf resonance is not necessary, how should we understand experiments where disturbing motor regions selectively hinders action perception? A deflationary reading is available.\n\nFirst, TMS and lesion studies rarely abolish perception; they modestly slow or bias certain tasks. The brain is a highly interactive network, and perturbing one node often has cascading effects on distant nodes. Motor cortex is extensively connected with temporal and parietal areas that handle visual motion and object information; interference may impair perception indirectly, not because the motor code is constitutive of action understanding but because predictive feedback loops are disrupted.\n\nSecond, many such tasks require fine-grained anticipation of the exact future trajectory, for instance guessing when a grasp will close around an object. For these delicate temporal or kinematic judgments, recruiting parts of the motor system is computationally economical. However, being unable to anticipate the moment of contact is not the same as failing to notice that a grasp is aimed at drinking. The deficit is quantitative, not qualitative.\n\nThird, infant correlations between motor mastery and action anticipation admit alternative explanations. Developing a new motor skill gives the infant abundant visual experience of that pattern from a privileged first-person viewpoint. The extra visual familiarity, not the covert motor programme itself, may tune their perception. Experience-based associative learning models replicate such improvements without any need for an \u201cefference copy\u201d being fed into vision.\n\n6. Alternative frameworks for perceiving goals\n\nGiven the challenges to necessity, what mechanisms do support goal perception when resonance is absent?\n\n6.1 Teleological reasoning\n\nGergely and Csibra propose that infants possess a \u201cteleological stance\u201d: they automatically search for the most efficient causal path from current circumstances to a future desirable state. If an agent deviates around an obstacle to reach an object, the infant encodes the movement as rationally efficient given constraints, and forms the expectation that when the obstacle is removed, the agent will adopt a straighter path. Experiments with animated geometric shapes show that such inference occurs even when the \u201cagent\u201d is a faceless blob whose movements are impossible for any infant to reproduce. The logic is evaluative: goal + constraints \u21d2 optimal action, not motoric emulation.\n\n6.2 Ecological perception of affordances\n\nFrom a Gibsonian standpoint, perceiving an action is perceiving a dynamic affordance layout: an apple affords grasping, a mouth affords insertion. When I see someone\u2019s hand shape conform to the apple, I immediately detect the \u201cfit\u201d relation that denotes a grabbing affordance. No internal simulation is required; perception is direct inasmuch as environmental structure specifies possibilities for achievement. Crucially, I can perceive that an elephant trunk affords wrapping around a branch without possessing a trunk.\n\n6.3 Hierarchical predictive coding\n\nContemporary computational neuroscience often treats the brain as a hierarchical generative model that minimises prediction error. On this view, multiple parallel pathways generate complementary predictions about observed motion: low-level visual cortices extrapolate spatiotemporal trajectories, mid-level regions apply learned transition probabilities between bodily postures, higher-level regions invoke abstract knowledge about tools, social norms, scripts, and goals. Motor areas contribute one class of predictions, especially when the observed kinematics match the observer\u2019s own effector library, but their output competes and cooperates with visual and conceptual priors. If motor regions are offline, higher-level priors can still sustain adequate prediction so long as prediction error remains tolerable.\n\nThe hierarchical model predicts that motor resonance is most helpful when:\n\na. The movement lies within the observer\u2019s biomechanical range.\n\nb. Visual information is noisy or ambiguous.\n\nc. Rapid, millisecond-scale prediction is required (e.g., catching a ball).\n\nOtherwise, alternate priors will dominate.\n\n7. Reconciling pluralism with functional importance\n\nAcknowledging that resonance is not necessary does not relegate it to epiphenomenal status. There are good reasons to expect an organism to recycle its own motor maps for social perception whenever possible:\n\ni. Evolutionary efficiency: sensory-motor loops are fast and automatically tuned to biologically relevant trajectories.\n\nii. Embodied constraints: Knowing the energy costs, force profiles, and control limits of one\u2019s own body provides an economical heuristic for estimating what counts as an \u201cefficient\u201d movement for a conspecific whose morphology is similar.\n\niii. Affective coupling: Resonance may underwrite empathic responses, emotional contagion, and social cohesion. Lacking resonance might leave goal perception untouched but impair empathy.\n\nA pluralistic picture therefore emerges. Motor resonance is one route\u2014fast, embodied, emotionally rich\u2014but there are visual-conceptual routes and rational-teleological routes as well. Which route dominates depends on the context, the observer\u2019s expertise, the similarity between bodies, and task demands.\n\n8. Objections and replies\n\nObjection 1: If mirror neurons are not necessary, why are they so conservatively preserved across primate evolution?\n\nReply: Evolution often favours redundancy and speed, not necessity. The pupillary light reflex is not necessary for seeing in bright light; one can squint voluntarily. Yet the reflex is conserved because it is fast and automatic. Likewise, a motor resonance circuit may confer rapid, low-cost inference in real-time social interaction.\n\nObjection 2: TMS studies are causal, not correlative. When motor cortex is inhibited, subjects literally fail to understand actions.\n\nReply: \u201cUnderstand\u201d is too strong. Most TMS work shows subtle drops in discrimination accuracy or delayed reaction times, not categorical failure. Moreover, TMS affects networks beyond the targeted gyrus; the motor plan\u2019s disruption may reverberate, increasing visual uncertainty. Causation does not imply irreplaceability.\n\nObjection 3: Without resonance, how could the system bind bodily movement to distal goals rather than treat movement as mere motion?\n\nReply: Binding can exploit object affordances, statistical co-occurrence (cups \u2192 mouths), and high-level scripts (\u201cpeople usually drink coffee at breakfast\u201d). Computational models successfully detect goals from third-person video using purely visual features plus Bayesian inference over possible ends. No motor command vectors appear in the algorithm, yet performance rivals human observers.\n\n9. Future directions\n\nTo move beyond the stalemate, research should:\n\na. Investigate populations with lifelong motor deprivation (e.g., individuals born without limbs) using ecologically valid tasks to distinguish kinematic anticipation from goal attribution.\n\nb. Use multivariate pattern analysis to dissociate neural signatures of goal attribution in ventrotemporal cortex from resonance signatures in premotor cortex during ambiguous versus unambiguous stimuli.\n\nc. Build computational models that dynamically weight motor and non-motor priors depending on uncertainty, allowing empirical testing via model comparison.\n\nd. Examine whether deficits in motor resonance predominantly affect empathy, rapport, and affective synchrony rather than the bare detection of goals.\n\n10. Conclusion\n\nThe allure of motor resonance lies in its elegant embodiment: we seem to grasp others\u2019 deeds because, in a faint echo, we do what they do. Yet seductiveness is not equivalence to necessity. Conceptual analysis shows that goal perception is primarily a matter of teleology and normative evaluation, which need not rely on shared motor schemata. Empirical evidence\u2014from infant cognition, neuropsychology, cross-species interpretation, and computational vision\u2014confirms that agents commonly perceive purposeful behaviour even when simulation is unavailable. Mirror-based resonance is best conceived as a highly efficient, evolutionarily advantageous shortcut that co-operates with, but does not ground, our capacity to perceive goal-directed action. The upshot is a pluralistic, multi-route framework: action understanding can be motoric when bodily overlap is high, visual-statistical when patterns are familiar, or abstract-rational when reasoning about dissimilar agents. What unites these routes is the brain\u2019s overarching imperative to predict and explain agency, not the particular algorithm it deploys in any given context.

{"question_id": "Smortchkova-SeeingGoalDirectedness-2020", "question": "Some philosophers and cognitive scientists have argued that motor resonance\u2014the mapping of another's action onto one's own motor repertoire\u2014is a necessary condition for perceiving goal-directed actions. On this view, one is able to perceive others' goal-directed actions only to the extent that one is able to simulate them with one's own motor system. Is motor resonance necessary for the perception of goal-directed actions, or can goal-directed actions be perceived independently of resonance mechanisms?", "answer": "1. Introduction  \n\nThe idea that we understand others\u2019 actions by internally replicating them\u2014echoing their movements in our own motor system\u2014has exercised enormous influence over recent philosophy of mind, cognitive science and social neuroscience. The discovery, in the premotor cortex of the macaque, of neurons that discharge both when a monkey grasps an object and when it sees somebody else grasp the same kind of object inspired the bold claim that \u201cmotor resonance\u201d is what allows us to see actions as goal-directed. By resonating, we allegedly recover the agent\u2019s motor plan, and thereby grasp the point of what we are seeing. Without that motor simulation, so the story goes, we would perceive nothing more than meaningless kinematic motion.\n\nIs that story correct? Must perception of goal-directed action ride piggy-back on resonance mechanisms? Or can one visually register an action as being \u201cfor a reason\u201d without translating it into a motor format one already possesses? I shall argue for the latter. Motor resonance is a powerful, developmentally early and sometimes indispensable aid to action perception, but it is neither conceptually nor empirically necessary. We can, and often do, see agency and goal-directed structure in movements for which we lack the motor know-how to resonate; correspondingly, brain and behavioural evidence shows that action perception can survive the disruption of resonance circuits. The upshot is a more ecumenical picture: motor resonance facilitates, enriches and stabilises the perception of others\u2019 goals, yet goal perception can also be grounded in purely visual\u2013causal analysis, broader pragmatic knowledge and more abstract social cognition.\n\n2. What exactly is at stake?  \n\nTo avoid talking past one another, we need a minimal definition of \u201cperceiving goal-directed action.\u201d I shall reserve that phrase for the capacity to discriminate\u2014online and non-inferentially\u2014between mere motion and behaviour that is \u201cfor\u201d something, e.g. between a hand accidentally brushing a cup and a hand reaching intentionally to drink. Such perception is plausibly richer than merely registering movement regularities; it involves grasping the teleological structure that organises the movement.\n\nMotor resonance, by contrast, is a process in which observing a movement excites pattern-matched activity in the observer\u2019s motor areas. Operationally, we detect resonance with techniques like fMRI, TMS, single-cell or EEG mu-suppression; theoretically, it is portrayed as a kind of covert action rehearsal that provides access to the motor program underlying what one sees.\n\nNecessity, finally, is a strong modal claim. If resonance were necessary, every intact instance of perceiving goal-directed action would have to be accompanied by matching motor activation; more pointedly, in the absence of such activation the perceptual capacity should be compromised.\n\n3. The case for the necessity thesis  \n\nThree broad arguments are typically offered in favour.\n\na) The kinematic indeterminacy argument. Purely visual information, it is said, underdetermines the goal of an action. The same trajectory of an arm can realise reaching for water, wiping a spill, signalling a friend or stretching a muscle. Only by secretly \u201cknowing from the inside\u201d how a given motor program organises the movement can the observer disambiguate the goal. Resonance purportedly supplies that inside knowledge.\n\nb) The developmental bootstrapping argument. Human infants in the first months of life show systematic resonance\u2014indexed by sensorimotor cortex activation\u2014when watching canonical grasping. At roughly the same time they begin to parse object-directed reaching as purposeful and expect the agent to continue in a goal-consistent manner. This temporal co-emergence is taken to indicate not just correlation but causal dependence.\n\nc) The neural lesion argument. Damage to premotor regions thought to house the mirror system (e.g. ventral premotor cortex, inferior parietal lobe) sometimes leads to apraxia, a deficit in both executing and recognising meaningful gestures. The parallel impairment is invoked as evidence that recognition, hence perception of goal-directedness, requires access to one\u2019s own motor programs.\n\n4. First conceptual challenge: the problem of unfamiliar actions  \n\nConsider watching a trained gymnast perform a double-back handspring, or a professional calligrapher drawing Kanji characters one cannot even attempt to reproduce. Intuitively one experiences those movements as purposeful, elegant, successful or flawed\u2014indeed one may even predict their continuation\u2014despite being quite unable to replicate them. The defender of necessity must thus maintain that a stripped-down motor resonance is nonetheless available: perhaps we use effector-general motor schemas, or motor primitives that approximate the observed kinematics. But this auxiliary hypothesis dilutes what made the thesis interesting in the first place: if any coarse excitation counts as resonance, the claim becomes trivial or unfalsifiable.\n\nThere is also systematic variation in motor capability across individuals. A person with congenital limb absence perceives others\u2019 upper-limb actions as goal-directed; a tetraplegic patient whose corticospinal tracts are severed does the same. If the necessitarian replies that \u201clatent\u201d motor maps still lurk in premotor cortex, one must explain how such maps are formed or preserved without the requisite sensory\u2013motor experience. The point is not merely empirical: conceptually, the capacity to perceive a goal seems not to require the capacity to enact that same goal.\n\n5. Second conceptual challenge: the transparency of perception  \n\nPerceiving goal-directedness is phenomenally immediate. I look at a hand that steadies a wine glass near the edge of the table and I see the adjustment as preventing spillage; I do not first rehearse stabilising gestures and then infer a goal. Perception is transparent to its content. If resonance were necessary, its operation would still be subpersonal, but it would need to feed forward a motor format that gets re-perceived as teleology. The explanatory burden then shifts: why would the visual system, which already receives the trajectory, offload the task of disambiguation to the motor system only to re-import the result? The economy of architecture pushes us towards a simpler account: robust visual causal analysis might do the job unaided, with resonance providing a redundancy or fast-track when available.\n\n6. Empirical evidence against necessity  \n\na) Patients with ventral premotor lesions. While some studies report impaired gesture recognition, careful assessment shows selective deficits: patients struggle with identifying pantomimed tool use (which involves semantic knowledge), yet they reliably recognise simple goal-directed reaches. Conversely, visual form agnosics with intact motor cortex fail to perceive goal structure despite presumably normal resonance. Double dissociations of this kind undermine a strict dependency.\n\nb) TMS and temporary deactivation. Repetitive TMS over the premotor mirror areas suppresses corticospinal excitability yet leaves participants\u2019 ability to explicitly judge the goal of an observed action largely intact. They do show slowed semantic processing or reduced sensitivity to subtle kinematic cues, but not the wholesale collapse that necessity predicts.\n\nc) Developmental anomalies. Infants born without hands systematically track the goal of others\u2019 hand actions and even anticipate their effects. Neuroimaging reveals that while they lack hand-specific sensorimotor cortex organisation, regions in occipito-temporal cortex hyper-differentiate gesture categories, suggesting compensatory visual specialisation.\n\nd) Cross-species perception. Dogs discriminate between humans who reach for food intentionally versus accidentally drop it, and do so despite having radically different end-effector anatomy. While dogs have motor cortex, they lack the fine-grained manual motor programs for grasping, making it implausible that resonance at an isomorphic level is doing the explanatory work.\n\ne) Tool use observation. We readily perceive the purpose of actions performed with unfamiliar tools, often before mastering their use. Here again goal perception outruns motor resonance.\n\n7. Alternative explanatory resources  \n\nIf resonance is not necessary, what enables goal perception?\n\n1. Kinematic heuristics. Intentional movements exhibit distinctive velocity profiles (sigmoidal or bell-shaped), temporal coupling of joints and straight-line trajectories toward targets. The visual system can exploit these invariant patterns without needing to translate them into motor commands. Computer vision models classify purposeful reach-to-grasp actions using purely optical flow and target prediction; the brain could implement similar computations.\n\n2. Causal affordance perception. Gibsonian ecological psychology insists that objects and environments \u201coffer\u201d possibilities for action that are directly perceivable. To see a mug as graspable is already to see the potential telos of an approaching hand in relation to that affordance. Such perception is anchored in visuospatial relations, not necessarily in internal motor replication.\n\n3. Teleological inference. Developmental psychologists Gergely and Csibra show that even infants attribute efficiency to agents: they expect the path of motion to be the energy-minimal route given the constraints. This rationality expectation, dubbed the \"teleological stance\", can be formalised as Bayesian inverse planning: infer the goal that renders the observed path approximately optimal. That computational problem can be solved in vision without executing the motor plan oneself.\n\n4. Semantic and narrative knowledge. Understanding that someone opens a window to ventilate the room draws on world knowledge about air flow and comfort, not on rehearsing window-opening muscles. Such higher-level cognition can feed back to perceptual interpretation, enabling rapid goal attribution.\n\n8. A reconciliatory account: resonance as enhancer, not prerequisite  \n\nWhile not necessary, resonance is far from epiphenomenal. It supplies at least three benefits.\n\na) Speed. Motor simulation runs on dedicated hardware optimised for forward prediction; it can therefore enable anticipatory eye movements and fine-grained temporal predictions that purely visual routes would approximate only more slowly. Evidence: catching errors or anticipating the apex of ballistic movements depends on motor rather than solely visual areas.\n\nb) Robustness under noise. When vision is degraded (fog, occlusion) motor priors can fill in missing kinematic detail, stabilising goal perception.\n\nc) Embodied empathic access. Resonance supports vicarious experiences of effort, pain and fluency\u2014phenomena arguably irreducible to abstract goal identification.\n\nThus, the architecture is plausibly dual-route. A \u201cvisual-analytical\u201d pathway extracts goals from optic information and pragmatic knowledge; a \u201cmotor-resonant\u201d pathway supplies rapid, embodied predictions. They interact, but either can in principle carry the load alone. This fits with broader models of social cognition that accommodate both low-level automatic empathy and high-level theory-of-mind reasoning.\n\n9. Potential objections and replies  \n\nObjection 1: The empirical dissociations merely show that the minimal circuitry for resonance lies elsewhere or that redundant pathways compensate. Hence the necessity claim is preserved at a more abstract level.  \nReply: Moves that retreat to superordinate abstractions\u2014e.g. \u201csome motoric representation\u201d located anywhere\u2014risk unfalsifiability. Science demands operational criteria: if goal perception persists under complete motor system deactivation (hypothetically by pharmacological blockade of corticospinal and premotor neurons) the necessity claim would fail. Current data already approximate such tests with selective lesions.\n\nObjection 2: Perceiving unfamiliar actions as purposeful uses analogical resonance with crude motor primitives (e.g. effector-independent muscles of the trunk). So resonance is still implicated.  \nReply: Analogy alone cannot supply the specific goal content: trunk muscles do not encode grasping sub-goals. At best they provide generic \u201cmovement energy\u201d templates. The disambiguation of drinking versus wiping still needs visual-causal analysis; therefore resonance is not sufficient and thus not necessary.\n\nObjection 3: Evolutionary parsimony favours reutilising the motor system for perception; adding a separate visual inference engine is wasteful.  \nReply: Evolution often builds overlapping, not strictly single-use, systems. Vision already requires sophisticated causal analysis for object recognition, so extending that machinery to action perception is parsimonious. Moreover, motor resonance circuits might themselves have arisen as exaptive add-ons to a pre-existing visual goal parser.\n\n10. Philosophical implications  \n\nIf motor resonance is not necessary, then social perception is less parochial and egocentric than sometimes feared. I need not shoe-horn another\u2019s action into my idiosyncratic motor repertoire before I can see its point; thus, radical bodily difference need not preclude mutual intelligibility. This has ethical import: empathy grounded exclusively in \u201cbeing like me\u201d risks marginalising those whose bodies diverge. A pluralistic mechanism base permits a more inclusive social epistemology.\n\nFor philosophy of mind, the result bolsters the autonomy of perceptual content: teleological properties can be genuinely perceived rather than inferred from enactive simulation. This supports relational or naively realist accounts of social perception, where we are directly acquainted with others\u2019 meanings.\n\nFinally, for embodiment theorists, the lesson is modesty, not defeat. Bodies still matter: they scaffold developmental learning and supply efficient prediction top-down. Yet embodiment does not monopolise cognitive access to action understanding; disembodied computations (in vision and abstract cognition) cooperate.\n\n11. Conclusion  \n\nMotor resonance is a remarkable discovery that has enriched our picture of how perception, action and social cognition intertwine. But the weight of conceptual argument and empirical evidence counsels against elevating it to a necessary condition for perceiving goal-directed actions. People without the full motor repertoire, non-humans with divergent effectors, and observers under motor cortical disruption all manage to perceive purposiveness. Visual kinematic heuristics, causal\u2010affordance analysis and teleological inference constitute alternative pathways, with resonance acting as a facilitator that speeds and deepens, but does not ground, action perception.\n\nConsequently, the proper lesson is integration, not elimination. Understanding others is a multi-layered achievement: sometimes we know what they are up to by \u201cfeeling\u201d ourselves do it; at other times, we simply see the point in the play of light and motion before us. Social perception is thus both resonant and reflective, both embodied and visual, with neither pole enjoying exclusive necessity.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 2, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 3070, "reasoning_tokens": 128}
{"question_id": "Smortchkova-SeeingGoalDirectedness-2020", "question": "Some philosophers and cognitive scientists have argued that motor resonance\u2014the mapping of another's action onto one's own motor repertoire\u2014is a necessary condition for perceiving goal-directed actions. On this view, one is able to perceive others' goal-directed actions only to the extent that one is able to simulate them with one's own motor system. Is motor resonance necessary for the perception of goal-directed actions, or can goal-directed actions be perceived independently of resonance mechanisms?", "answer": "1. Framing the problem  \n\nWhen philosophers and cognitive scientists speak of \u201cmotor resonance,\u201d they typically have in mind the class of neural processes through which observation of another\u2019s movement activates, in the observer, patterns that partially overlap with those used when she herself performs the same movement. Mirror-neuron activity in premotor and parietal cortices, electromyographic micro-facilitation in homologous muscles, and changes in corticospinal excitability during action observation are the best-known markers.  \n\nThe controversial claim we must evaluate is a strong one: motor resonance is a necessary condition for perceiving another\u2019s action as goal-directed. Put negatively, if the observer\u2019s motor system were prevented from resonating, she could not perceive the action as aimed at a goal at all; what she would register would be mere limb motion devoid of purposive character. Let us call this the Necessity Thesis (NT). The rival position, the Independence Thesis (IT), holds that an observer can in principle and often in practice perceive goal-directedness without relying on resonance mechanisms, even if such mechanisms may, when available, speed or enrich action understanding.\n\nI shall argue for IT. My case is three-pronged:\n\na) Conceptual analysis shows that NT overidentifies motor simulation with perceptual content and misconstrues the explanatory target;  \nb) Empirical work from developmental psychology, neuropsychology, and cross-cultural research reveals intact perception of goal-directedness where resonance is minimal or absent; and  \nc) There exist plausible alternative models\u2014ecological, inferential, and predictive\u2014which do not invoke resonance yet succeed in accounting for the relevant phenomena.\n\n2. What must be explained?  \n\n\u201cPerceiving goal-directedness\u201d can denote at least three different capacities:\n\ni) Detecting that a movement is produced by an animate agent rather than a physical cause (the animacy judgment).  \nii) Segmenting an ongoing stream of bodily motion into discrete actions with sub-goal structure.  \niii) Grasping\u2014or at least being sensitive to\u2014the distal goal toward which the action is directed (e.g., that a hand reaching over an obstacle is aiming for the apple, not for the space traversed).\n\nThe Necessity Thesis is plausible only if it concerns the third sense: sheer animacy detection or segmentation are patently possible for entities that lack any motor correspondence with the observed effector (for instance, a frog detecting prey trajectory). The crux, therefore, is whether the attribution of a distal goal requires resonance.\n\n3. The best case for the Necessity Thesis  \n\nProponents of NT draw on three lines of argument. First, they cite single-cell recordings in macaques: mirror neurons in area F5 fire both when the monkey grasps an object with a precision grip and when it sees another monkey perform that grip. Importantly, the same neuron typically does not fire for meaningless flailing, suggesting a sensitivity to goal structure rather than mere kinematics. Second, psychophysical studies show that temporarily disrupting premotor resonance\u2014for example, by administering repetitive TMS over the hand area while subjects watch grasping\u2014impairs subsequent explicit goal identification. Third, simulation theorists contend that what it is to perceive an action as goal-directed is precisely to map it onto one\u2019s own motor program; to attribute a goal is just to run a covert version of the action plan that, were one executing it, would subserve achievement of the goal.\n\nIn short, NT is supported by a synthesis of neuroscientific correlates, causal intervention data, and an identity claim about what constitutes understanding.\n\n4. Conceptual difficulties with NT  \n\nThe identity claim faces an immediate Euthyphro-style dilemma: Do we judge an observed movement to be goal-directed because our motor program resonates, or does the motor program resonate because we have perceptually detected goal features? If the former, we need an extramotor basis that selects the appropriate program; if the latter, resonance is downstream and cannot be constitutive.\n\nMoreover, the notion of a \u201cnecessary condition\u201d must be distinguished from that of a \u201ctypical correlate.\u201d Heartbeat acceleration is a typical correlate of fear, but a subject with autonomic failure can still experience fear; similarly, mirror activity may be a frequent accompaniment of goal perception without being indispensable.\n\nFinally, NT risks circularity: it defines goal representation in terms of motor emulation, and then reads empirical support into the fact that mirror neurons track goal parameters. Yet mirror activation might track those parameters because perceptual systems have already encoded them, passing the information forward to the motor cortex.\n\n5. Developmental evidence  \n\nInfants perceive goal-directedness months before they can execute the relevant actions. At six months they robustly expect a reaching arm to go to its prior goal object even if the object\u2019s position has changed, provided that the reaching trajectory continues toward that goal (Woodward 1998). Six-month-olds cannot yet perform such a reach reliably themselves, nor do their corticospinal tracts exhibit adult-like resonance patterns. Southgate and colleagues (2010) did find some mu-rhythm desynchronisation in infants, but the amplitude is modest and the ontogeny of mirror areas continues well into the second year. The ability to perceive goals therefore precedes\u2014and plausibly scaffolds\u2014the maturation of resonance, not vice versa.\n\nStronger evidence comes from newborn chicks and human neonates: they follow with their eyes a self-propelled agent that traverses barriers in a goal-consistent manner (Luo & Baillargeon 2007), despite having no motor competence for such detours. If goal perception can arise in organisms whose motor repertoire is immature or altogether inapt for the observed action, resonance cannot be conceptually necessary.\n\n6. Neuropsychological dissociations  \n\nPatients with limb apraxia, Parkinson\u2019s disease, or lesions to premotor regions often exhibit reduced or absent motor resonance as indexed by TMS and fMRI, yet their capacity to identify others\u2019 goals is largely intact. For example, Pazzaglia et al. (2008) tested apraxic patients on a task requiring them to judge the goal of pantomimed tool use; accuracy was unimpaired relative to controls, although kinematic imitation was poor. Conversely, damage to the posterior superior temporal sulcus, a visual region sensitive to biological motion, can impair action understanding even when the motor system is spared (Saygin 2007). These double dissociations point to partial independence.\n\nAn especially telling case comes from individuals born without upper limbs. Vannuscorps and Caramazza (2016) report that such participants perform normally in visual goal recognition tasks involving hand actions; yet they literally lack any efferent or afferent hand representation that could resonate. While they may engage compensatory foot or mouth motor schemas, neuro-imaging demonstrates atypically low activation in canonical hand mirror areas. The cleanest explanation is that the visual system extracts goal information directly, while motor imagery plays at most a subsidiary role.\n\n7. Cross-effector and cross-species perception  \n\nHumans easily recognise the predatory pounce of a lion, the pecking of a bird, or the strike of an octopus\u2019s tentacle. None of these actions map onto our own motor repertoire. Correspondingly, octopuses and birds can learn to interpret human gestures without possessing homologous limbs. If resonance were necessary, we should expect a systematic inability to perceive the goals of morphologically alien agents; the empirical record plainly contradicts this.\n\nProponents of NT might reply that resonance operates at an abstract, effector-independent level\u2014what Rizzolatti calls \u201cgoal coding beyond the specifics of the means.\u201d But that concession weakens the thesis considerably. For if the mapping need not preserve biomechanical correspondence, then the distinctive property that made motor mirroring appealing\u2014namely, direct reuse of one\u2019s motor representations\u2014evaporates. The mechanism would be better described as amodal predictive coding, which can be implemented equally well in high-level perceptual areas.\n\n8. Causal intervention studies revisited  \n\nWhat about TMS and tDCS evidence showing that perturbing motor cortex degrades performance in certain goal-identification tasks? First, the effects are generally small (3\u201310% accuracy drops), transient, and task-specific. Second, motor areas are heavily interconnected with superior temporal and parietal visual regions; disrupting them spreads noise through the network, so the resulting impairment does not establish necessity. By analogy, cooling the motor cortex may impair speech comprehension because of corticocortical connections, but nobody would conclude that articulatory simulation is necessary for hearing phonemes.\n\nMoreover, several studies report preserved or even enhanced goal judgments under conditions that suppress motor resonance. Strafella and Paus (2000) found no decrement in goal inference after repetitive TMS when the tasks emphasised abstract goal properties rather than kinematic detail. Walbrin and Koldewyn (2019) showed that adults wearing restrictive arm casts for 48 hours exhibited attenuated motor resonance yet unchanged ability to track goals.\n\n9. Alternative explanatory frameworks  \n\nIf resonance is not necessary, what mechanisms underlie goal perception? Two broad families of accounts compete:\n\na) Ecological and Gestalt approaches maintain that distal goals are specified in the visual array through kinematic invariants. A hand that slows as it approaches an object, preshapes its aperture, and aligns its digits to graspable affordances projects a pattern whose \u201cintentional vector\u201d can be detected directly by specialized motion detectors in pSTS and MT-complex. Cutting and Proffitt (1981) famously described such invariants for catching and throwing.\n\nb) Teleological or rational constructivist approaches, pioneered by Gergely and Csibra, propose that observers, even infants, apply a principle of rational efficiency: Given the constraints (obstacles, costs), interpret the observed trajectory as the most efficient means to a contextually appropriate goal. Computationally, this is akin to inverse planning in a Bayesian framework: the visual system infers the goal that would render the observed path most probable under an efficiency prior. Crucially, the inference can be done without simulating the detailed motor commands; it relies instead on abstract causal reasoning.\n\nPredictive-coding models can unify the two: higher-level expectations about goals generate predictions of likely kinematics, which are compared to sensory input. Prediction error can be reduced both by updating the goal hypothesis (perceptual inference) and by activating compatible motor programs (resonance). This architecture makes resonance a modulatory component, not an indispensable prerequisite.\n\n10. Why resonance sometimes helps  \n\nHaving rejected necessity, we should still account for the ubiquity of motor resonance in ordinary observers. Three benefits stand out:\n\n1. Temporal extrapolation. Because motor programs are generative, activating them allows the observer to anticipate fine-grained trajectories and hidden phases, improving online tracking under occlusion.  \n\n2. Precision weighting. Mirroring increases the gain of prediction error signals for effectors we can control, allowing rapid detection of subtle deviations (e.g., errors in a partner\u2019s piano fingering).  \n\n3. Embodied social alignment. Resonance facilitates emotional engagement and imitation learning, thereby supporting broader socio-cognitive functions.\n\nThese advantages explain why evolution may have integrated visual and motor systems without making the latter strictly necessary for goal detection.\n\n11. Theoretical parsimony and the burden of proof  \n\nPhilosophical methodology counsels us to prefer the least ontologically and mechanistically loaded explanation that fits the data (all else equal). Given that perceptual and inferential models without resonance can already account for goal perception, while resonance-free cases of intact goal understanding are documented, the burden shifts to NT proponents to demonstrate impossibility rather than mere prevalence. So far no such demonstration exists.\n\n12. Objections and replies  \n\nObjection 1: Even if infants and amelic individuals lack overt motor representations, they might possess latent sub-personal resonance at some more abstract level.  \n\nReply: A hypothesis that allows arbitrarily \u201clatent\u201d resonance is unfalsifiable; it collapses to the claim that goal perception is always accompanied by some neural process, the properties of which are specified post hoc. Empirical science demands operationalisable criteria. By the standards used to assert resonance in healthy adults (corticospinal facilitation, fMRI in premotor sectors), the counter-cases are negative.\n\nObjection 2: Cross-species goal perception may rely on generic motor schemas such as \u201capproach-and-grasp,\u201d implementable with any effector. That still counts as motor resonance.  \n\nReply: If the schema is indeed effector-agnostic and implemented in associative, not strictly motor, cortex, calling it \u201cmotor\u201d fudges the taxonomy. The relevant question is whether it depends on the observer\u2019s capacity to execute the same schema. Birds cannot perform a human bimanual piano trill, yet can learn to anticipate its temporal pattern. The posited schema is thus not motor in any robust sense.\n\nObjection 3: The predictive-coding framework you champion inherits simulation, since prediction involves reenacting action dynamics.  \n\nReply: Prediction need not be motoric; one can predict planetary motion without having a motor program for planets. Generative models span multiple representational formats; motor routines are only one possible substrate. The brain likely employs fast, sensory-based forward models for external objects that never implicate the motor cortex.\n\n13. A pluralistic model  \n\nThe totality of evidence invites a pluralistic view. There is a visually based system, centered on pSTS and temporal motion areas, that quickly extracts animacy and goal cues from kinematics and context. In parallel, a fronto-parietal mirroring system may, when applicable, instantiate a motor simulation of the observed action, enriching temporal prediction and emotional resonance. The two systems interact bidirectionally, but neither is constitutively dependent on the other for core function. Goal perception is multiply realisable: it can be achieved by visual-inferential means alone or by an integrated visuomotor loop.\n\n14. Conclusion  \n\nMotor resonance is a striking and ecologically useful phenomenon; it is frequently, perhaps ubiquitously, recruited when humans watch conspecifics act. Nevertheless, necessity is a strong modal claim unsupported by conceptual analysis and contradicted by a growing body of empirical data. Perceiving goal-directed action is possible\u2014and in many developmental, clinical, and cross-species contexts actual\u2014without recourse to motor simulation. Resonance helps, but perception can do without it.\n\nIn philosophy as in science, we should beware of mistaking a handy ally for an indispensable partner.

Introduction  \n\nFew discoveries in recent cognitive science have excited philosophers as much as the finding that premotor neurons in the macaque F5 fire both when the monkey grasps an object and when it observes another agent doing the same (di Pellegrino et al. 1992). \u201cMirror\u201d or motor-resonant activity seems to offer an elegant, neural implementation of the simulation theory of mindreading: we understand others by re-using our own motor programs \u201coff-line.\u201d A number of theorists have accordingly proposed a strong necessity claim:\n\nNecessity Thesis (NT): An observer perceives another creature\u2019s action as goal-directed only if the observer\u2019s motor system is able to covertly map\u2014or resonate with\u2014the observed movement.\n\nMy purpose is to assess NT. I shall argue that motor resonance is neither conceptually nor empirically necessary for the perceptual attribution of goal-directedness, although it often plays a facilitative or epistemically enhancing role. I structure the discussion as follows. Section 2 clarifies what \u201cperceiving an action as goal-directed\u201d amounts to. Section 3 presents the main arguments adduced for NT, both conceptual and empirical. Section 4 canvasses four families of counter-evidence: (i) cross-effector and cross-species perception; (ii) perception in motor-impaired or motor-atypical humans; (iii) infant and developmental data; and (iv) purely visual computations of intentional structure. Section 5 develops a positive alternative: a pluralistic \u201cminimal-teleological\u201d account according to which goal-directedness is recoverable from publicly available kinematic and contextual cues, with simulation providing a contingent, context-sensitive shortcut rather than a necessary route. Section 6 replies to residual objections and section 7 concludes.\n\n2. What Is It to Perceive Goal-Directed Action?  \n\nAction perception involves more than registering bodily motion. When I see a baker stretch for a loaf, I normally grasp the act as reaching-for-bread. Philosophers call the loaf the \u201cgoal\u201d or \u201coutcome\u201d of the act and the stretch a means. To say that I perceive the movement as goal-directed means the following:\n\n1. Teleological content: The movement is experienced as answerable to a purpose, not merely as a kinematic trajectory.  \n2. Perceptual immediacy: The purposiveness is experienced directly in the perception, not (solely) as an explicit post-perceptual inference.  \n3. Ecological coupling: My perception is sensitive to changes in the spatial relation between limb and object, to obstacles, efficiencies of path, and so on.\n\nNothing here yet commits us to any specific subpersonal mechanism. NT adds the further claim that covert motor simulation is indispensable for furnishing the visual system with these contents.\n\n3. The Case for Necessity  \n\nProponents of NT typically advance three lines of argument.\n\nA. The Conceptual/Symmetry Argument  \nWe define actions themselves, it is claimed, in terms of motor programs. If an action type (say, grasping) just is a stored motor\u208bschema, then only an organism that has or can run that schema could detect the action in another. This argument relies on a symmetry between production and recognition.\n\nB. The Empirical Activation Argument  \nFunctional imaging shows that the premotor cortex of human observers activates during observation of familiar goal-directed acts. Interfering with this activity using TMS slows or impairs recognition and prediction of those acts (Avenanti et al. 2007). Ergo, resonance is a causal condition for perception.\n\nC. The Poverty-of-Stimulus Argument  \nThe visual array alone underdetermines goal structure: an object-directed reach and a random arm fling can share kinematic properties. The system therefore needs extra-visual information, supplied by the observer\u2019s own motor knowledge, to disambiguate intentions.\n\nTaken together, the arguments appear to license NT. Yet each is weaker than it looks.\n\n4. Four Sources of Counter-Evidence  \n\n4.1 Cross-Effector and Cross-Species Perception  \nHumans easily recognize goal-directed behavior in octopuses, snakes, dogs, and even animated geometric figures (Heider & Simmel). Most of us, however, lack the motor programs for slithering, suction-cup grasping, or hula-hoop locomotion. Granted, mirror-like neurons show some effector indifference (they respond to grasping by the hand or by pliers); but there are limits. The typical adult cannot execute, imagine, or plan a tentacular reach. Yet we see the octopus hunting, not merely moving. Unless one posits an extremely abstract, all-purpose resonance that fires for any physical trajectory toward a distal object\u2014thereby emptying the notion of \u201cmotor\u201d content\u2014the data tell against NT.\n\n4.2 Motor-Atypical Observers  \n(a) Congenital limb aplasia. Vannuscorps & Caramazza (2016) tested individuals born without arms. Despite lifelong absence of upper-limb motor representations, they categorize hand actions and intentions as quickly and accurately as controls; indeed, their ventral visual stream shows typical hand-action selectivity. Although premotor resonance is diminished, goal perception remains.\n\n(b) Locked-in syndrome and spinal cord injury. Patients with complete efferent blockade, unable to execute or covertly prepare limb movements, nonetheless track others\u2019 action goals through eye movements (Franz et al. 2015).  \n\n(c) Parkinson\u2019s disease. Even when dopaminergic depletion disrupts internal motor simulation, patients can recognize other agents\u2019 purposive gestures, though their own movement is impaired (Poljac et al. 2010).\n\nIf motor resonance were necessary, these populations would systematically fail to perceive goal-directedness.\n\n4.3 Developmental Evidence  \nHuman infants in the first year cannot yet execute many of the actions they nevertheless perceive teleologically. Three-month-olds interpret a mechanical claw consistently pursuing one of two objects as \u201cpreferring\u201d that object (Woodward 1998). Four-month-olds expect an agent to choose an efficient path around obstacles (Csibra et al. 1999). Simulation-based explanations are implausible at this age because the relevant motor plans (e.g., locomotion around barriers) are undeveloped. While mirror activity emerges early, it is weak and noisy, suggesting that infants rely primarily on visual or basic teleological heuristics.\n\n4.4 Vision-Only Computations of Intentional Structure  \nModern computer-vision systems, lacking anything like a motor system, are now able to classify human actions and infer likely goals from video input. While artificial successes do not directly prove human capacities, they demonstrate the computational sufficiency of kinematic and contextual cues. Furthermore, psychophysical work identifies purely optical invariants\u2014velocity profiles, temporal reversals, object trajectories\u2014that support goal attribution (Runeson & Frykholm 1983). The \u201cpoverty of stimulus\u201d premise is therefore overstated: the optic array is richer than simulation theorists imagine.\n\n5. A Pluralistic Minimal-Teleological Account  \n\nAbandoning NT need not reduce us to an implausible intellectualism. Instead we can adopt a layered model:\n\nLevel 1: Visual-teleological heuristics  \nThe perceptual system treats spatiotemporal regularities indicative of efficient action\u2014straight-line approach to target, smooth deceleration near object\u2014as goal cues. These heuristics are fast, automatic, and require no motor copy.\n\nLevel 2: Contextual/bayesian integration  \nScene statistics (object affordances, agent identity, prior probabilities) are integrated to refine the guess. A Bayesian observer variables-out hidden states (goal, path, obstacles) from visible data. This level is also amodal.\n\nLevel 3: Motor resonance as optional shortcut  \nWhen the observed act falls within the observer\u2019s repertoire, premotor circuits can internally emulate the unfolding kinematics, generating rapid forward predictions of hand trajectory and expected sensory consequences. Motor resonance thus supports fine-grained anticipation (e.g., catching timing), improves discrimination under noise, and yields phenomenological intimacy (\u201cI feel what she is about to do\u201d). But because Levels 1 and 2 can, in principle, deliver goal attribution on their own, resonance is not necessary.\n\nPhilosophically, this amounts to denying the modal claim (necessity), while affirming a weaker existential or facilitative claim:\n\nFacilitation Thesis (FT): In many contexts, motor resonance enhances the speed, accuracy, or experiential richness of perceiving goal-directed action.\n\nFT is compatible with all the above data. It predicts resilience of goal perception under motor impairment but also explains why, in neurotypical adults, TMS to premotor cortex slows but does not abolish recognition\u2014the system simply falls back on slower visual analysis.\n\n6. Replies to Objections  \n\nObjection 1: Congenital limb-absent individuals might still possess abstract effector-independent motor representations acquired through observation.  \n\nReply: Representations acquired solely from vision are not motor in the relevant sense; they piggyback on perceptual learning. If NT insists on such broad \u201cmotor\u201d codes, it becomes vacuous. The burden is on NT to demarcate genuine motor simulation.\n\nObjection 2: Mirror-resonant activity may exist below the detection threshold of current methods, even in atypical observers; thus the counter-evidence is inconclusive.  \n\nReply: True, absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, but NT shoulders the stronger modal claim. To rescue necessity by positing unfalsifiable micro-resonance invites the fallacy of immunization. Science typically favors the simpler hypothesis that systems demonstrably lacking standard motor schemas can still perceive goals.\n\nObjection 3: Without resonance, perception is too slow for on-line social interaction.  \n\nReply: Speed constraints vary by task. Catching a thrown object requires millisecond prediction, where resonance excels. Understanding an instrumental act requires only hundreds of milliseconds, within the capacity of vision. Mixed evidence shows that patients lacking resonance can still engage socially, albeit with subtle temporal deficits; these are costs, not impossibilities.\n\n7. Conclusion  \n\nThe debate over motor resonance touches on large philosophical themes: the nature of perception, the role of embodiment in cognition, and the mechanisms of social understanding. Careful conceptual analysis and empirical scrutiny converge on a pluralistic verdict. Motor resonance is a valuable, often-used tool in the perceptual arsenal, but it is not the sole gatekeeper of goal attribution. Humans, infants, nonhuman animals, and even machines can recover purposive structure from the visible dynamics and context of movement, drawing on general inferential resources when resonance is unavailable. By reframing simulation as a contingent aid rather than a necessary precondition, we preserve the intuitive insights of the mirror-neuron program while acknowledging the versatility and redundancy of the social mind.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 4, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 2594, "reasoning_tokens": 256}

Introduction  \n\nTo an observer, seeing another person reach for a cup is usually effortless: we not only register a bodily movement but seem to apprehend, pre-reflectively, that the person is \u201ctrying to pick the cup up.\u201d A family of simulation\u2013based theories of social cognition\u2014stemming from early mirror-neuron work and elaborated in cognitive science\u2014contends that this intuitive capacity depends on motor resonance: the automatic mapping of the perceived movement onto the perceiver\u2019s own motor system. If the neural circuitry that would produce the movement in me is covertly activated when I watch you act, the claim goes, that activation provides the very medium through which I perceive your action as goal-directed. The strong version of the thesis is modal: without motor resonance, perception of goal-directedness cannot occur.\n\nIn what follows I argue that the strong necessity claim is untenable. Motor resonance is one among several routes\u2014perhaps a particularly efficient or developmentally primary one\u2014through which goal-directedness can be made perceptually available, but it is neither logically nor empirically necessary. I begin (sect. 2) by clarifying the concepts of \u201cmotor resonance,\u201d \u201cperception,\u201d and \u201cgoal-directedness.\u201d Section 3 reconstructs the main arguments for the necessity thesis, drawing on philosophical simulationism and mirror-neuron research. Section 4 presents four lines of critique: conceptual, empirical, developmental, and evolutionary. Section 5 discusses alternative mechanisms\u2014kinematic heuristics, contextual inference, and ecological affordances\u2014that can ground perceptual access to others\u2019 goals without motor resonance. Section 6 addresses the strongest remaining objections and explains why sufficiency, not necessity, is the right verdict. I conclude (sect. 7) by situating the debate in a broader pluralist framework about social perception.\n\n2. Conceptual Clarifications  \n\n2.1 Motor Resonance  \n\u201cMotor resonance\u201d is the fast, involuntary activation of (part of) the observer\u2019s motor system when she perceives another individual moving. In laboratory practice this is often indexed by TMS-evoked motor potentials, mu-rhythm suppression, or single-cell recordings of mirror neurons. Crucially, resonance is somatotopically specific: watching a hand grasp tends to excite hand-related motor areas, watching a kick excites leg areas, and so on.\n\n2.2 Perceptual Availability  \nTo perceive a goal is not merely to form a reflective judgment\u2014\u201cI think she intends to grasp the cup\u201d\u2014but to experience the movement as imbued with teleological structure. Phenomenologically, the trajectory appears \u201con its way\u201d to the cup. For present purposes, I will take perception of goal-directedness to involve (minimally) the on-line attribution of a distal aim that guides the observed kinematics.\n\n2.3 Goal-Directedness  \nAn action counts as goal-directed if its unfolding is organized around the achievement of a distal outcome. Importantly, we often attribute goals across wide bodily and species boundaries: we can see a dog about to leap for a stick, a robot moving to plug itself in, or a pianist striking an octave\u2014despite the fact that we do not share every motor routine with these agents. The breadth of application already hints that reliance on a one-to-one bodily simulation might be too restrictive.\n\n3. The Case for Necessity  \n\n3.1 Philosophical Simulationism  \nAlvin Goldman and others argue that mind-reading emerges from a more general simulation heuristic: I understand your mental states by recreating, in a vicarious key, the inner processes I would undergo if I were acting as you do. Mirror mechanisms provide the neural implementation of such simulation. If seeing is underwritten by simulation, then lacking the relevant motor program would deprive me of perceptual access to your goal.\n\n3.2 Evidence from Mirror-Neuron Studies  \nEmpirical work suggests that mirror areas respond more intensely to goal-directed than to non-goal-directed movements, they encode the aim of an action even when the distal goal is hidden from view, and lesions to premotor cortex can hinder action understanding. These findings are marshalled to argue that the mirror system does not just correlate with, but is constitutive of, perceiving goals.\n\n3.3 Developmental Arguments  \nAt three to five months, human infants manifest motor resonance and appear able to parse goal-directed reaches. Given their limited cognitive resources, simulationists infer a causal link: the primitive capacity to covertly reproduce the movement grounds the very possibility of goal perception.\n\n4. Four Lines of Critique  \n\n4.1 Conceptual Counter-Examples  \nNecessity is a strong modal claim: if motor resonance were necessary, then whenever it is absent goal perception should be impossible. But consider:\n\na. Observing novel tool actions. I can readily recognize that a skilled carpenter is aiming to dovetail two boards even though I lack any corresponding motor program; my motor system resonates minimally, yet I perceive the goal.  \n\nb. Cross-species cases. I see a dolphin arc toward a fish. I have no motor routine for tail-propelled movement, but the goal is visually manifest.  \n\nc. Intentional omissions. I can see that a goalkeeper is deliberately refraining from moving early to mislead the striker; here resonance would actually be suppressed relative to movement, yet the goal (to deceive) is perceived.\n\nThese examples show, at least prima facie, that motor simulation is not constitutive of perceiving goals.\n\n4.2 Empirical Dissociations  \na. Akinetic but understanding: Parkinson\u2019s disease patients with severe motor deficits, or individuals with spinal cord injuries, retain robust capacities for action understanding even when motor resonance signatures are drastically reduced.  \n\nb. Double dissociation: Apraxic patients may have damaged motor programs and impaired action production yet can identify others\u2019 goals; conversely, some individuals with intact resonance, such as certain autistic participants, report difficulties in grasping others\u2019 intentions.  \n\nc. TMS interference: Temporarily disrupting premotor areas diminishes resonance but, in many studies, does not significantly hinder performance on action-understanding tasks when compensatory visual and contextual cues are available.\n\n4.3 Developmental Plasticity  \nInfants born without limbs (amelia) cannot perform many common actions. Yet research by Meyer et al. shows they still perceive typical hand-based goals, relying more heavily on visual path information. The developing brain recruits alternative circuits\u2014temporal and parietal\u2014underscoring that resonance is not necessary, even if ordinarily recruited.\n\n4.4 Evolutionary Scope  \nGoal perception is crucial for predator\u2013prey interactions and social coordination across the animal kingdom. But only primates and some songbirds exhibit recognizable mirror systems. Species such as reptiles or insects navigate goal-directed environments without anything resembling human-like resonance. The phylogenetic spread of goal perception thus outstrips the distribution of mirror mechanisms.\n\n5. Alternative Routes to Goal Perception  \n\n5.1 Kinematic Heuristics  \nHumans are exquisitely sensitive to the law-like regularities that connect movement and goals. Trajectories that are efficient, smooth, and obey minimum-jerk principles are rapidly categorized as goal-directed. Computer-generated point-light displays trigger goal attributions despite impoverished bodily detail, suggesting that visual kinematics alone can ground teleological perception. Such heuristics depend on visual motion processing areas (MT/V5, STS) rather than premotor cortex.\n\n5.2 Contextual Inference and Bayesian Predictive Coding  \nAction unfolds in structured environments. Observers combine prior knowledge of situational affordances with on-line sensory data to infer likely goals. Predictive-coding models show that high-level expectations can drive goal ascription even when the specific motor gestures are ambiguous or unseen. These inferences, realized in temporo-parietal and medial-prefrontal networks, can occur with little or no resonance.\n\n5.3 Ecological Affordance Perception  \nFollowing Gibson and contemporary enactivists, perception of goal-directedness may piggyback on the direct perception of affordances. I need not covertly grasp the cup to see that the cup affords grasping: its handle, orientation, and distance situate it as the natural target of the hand I see moving toward it. The relational structure in the visual scene \u201cinvites\u201d the goal attribution, bypassing simulation.\n\n5.4 Linguistic and Symbolic Mediation  \nIn literate adults, linguistic labels and cultural scripts can make certain goals salient in advance of any motor imagery. Reading \u201cSurgeon at work\u201d under a video primes observers to detect operative goals that they could not personally enact, illustrating yet another cognitive\u2014rather than motoric\u2014pathway.\n\n6. Objections and Replies  \n\nObjection 1 - Epiphenomenal Alternatives  \nPerhaps non-resonant cues suffice in highly contrived laboratory tasks but in the ecological \u201cwild\u201d resonance invariably contributes; that still makes it practically necessary.  \n\nReply: Field studies on soccer, dance, or industrial assembly reveal that experts, who possess refined motor repertoires, do show heightened resonance, but novices accurately perceive core goals relying on visual and contextual strategies. Practical sufficiency lies with multiple interacting systems; no single route is obligatory.\n\nObjection 2 - Parsimony  \nSimulation offers the simplest neural mechanism; invoking extra heuristics adds explanatory clutter.  \n\nReply: Cognitive parsimony must trade off against explanatory adequacy. The plural mechanisms view is necessitated by empirical counter-evidence. Moreover, predictive\u2013coding accounts unify kinematic and contextual routes under a single formalism\u2014minimizing prediction error\u2014without presupposing motor execution as the sole substrate.\n\nObjection 3 - Developmental Primacy Entails Necessity  \nEven if adults can compensate, infants rely on resonance; thus the mechanism is developmentally necessary.  \n\nReply: Neonatal studies reveal that infants track statistical regularities in movement (Woodward paradigm) even before robust voluntary grasping. Limb-deficient infants still succeed. Resonance may scaffold efficiency but is not a prerequisite. Development is opportunistic: multiple pathways mature in tandem and can substitute for one another.\n\nObjection 4 - Lesion Cases Are Inconclusive  \npremotor lesions that spare understanding might reflect residual resonance in untouched sub-units.  \n\nReply: Even granting residual activity, the necessity claim requires that resonance be present in principle. Callosal disconnection, cerebellar degeneration, and full paralysis cases show near-elimination of motor cortical recruitment yet preserved goal perception, undermining indispensability.\n\n7. Conclusion: Toward a Pluralist Model  \n\nMotor resonance is a fascinating discovery and a powerful facilitator of social perception. Its fast, embodied, and largely automatic nature confers evolutionary advantages, especially when speed and fine-grained motor prediction matter (e.g., joint action, imitation learning). Yet the philosophical leap from \u201coften utilized\u201d to \u201cnecessary\u201d is unwarranted. Conceptual counter-examples, empirical dissociations, developmental plasticity, and cross-species considerations collectively demonstrate that perceiving goal-directed action can proceed through alternative channels\u2014visual kinematic heuristics, contextual Bayesian inference, and direct affordance detection. A pluralist framework that treats motor resonance as one implementational option within a broader predictive architecture better respects the diversity and resilience of human social cognition.\n\nAccordingly, the necessity thesis should be replaced by a sufficiency thesis: motor resonance is sufficient in many contexts to yield perception of goal-directedness, but it is not the sole or indispensable path. Recognizing its contingency opens fruitful avenues for studying how different mechanisms interact across development, pathology, expertise, and culture to secure our shared grasp of purposive action.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 5, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 2617, "reasoning_tokens": 128}

Introduction  \n\nWatching an accomplished pianist, we seem almost to \u201cfeel\u2019\u2019 her hands glide across the keys; cheering at a football match, we instinctively jerk forward when our striker shoots.  These familiar experiences have encouraged the thought that perceiving what others are doing relies on the covert activation of our own motor system.  The discovery of mirror neurons in macaque area F5, neurons that fire both when the animal grasps an object and when it observes another doing so, lent empirical credibility to this intuition.  An influential family of motor simulation theories (Gallese, Rizzolatti, Jeannerod, Goldman, et al.) claims that such resonance is not merely helpful but necessary: without mapping the observed movement onto one\u2019s own motor repertoire, one could not genuinely perceive its goal-directed character.  \n\nThe present essay questions that necessity claim.  I shall: (i) clarify what is meant by perceiving goal-directed action; (ii) present the principal arguments offered for the necessity of motor resonance; (iii) review empirical and conceptual considerations that undermine those arguments; and (iv) sketch an alternative, pluralist picture on which resonance is one among several routes to action perception.  My conclusion is conditional: motor resonance is neither sufficient nor necessary for perceiving goal-directed actions, though it frequently enriches, predicts, and scaffolds such perception.\n\n\n\n2.  What is it to perceive a goal-directed action?  \n\nPhilosophers distinguish between seeing that a bodily movement is occurring and seeing what that movement is for.  The latter is goal-perception: recognising an action as directed toward an outcome or object.  Importantly, the issue is one of perceptual content, not of subsequent inference.  When you watch someone slice bread you do not first register a series of kinematic segments and then deduce \u201cAha, she intends to make sandwiches\u201d; you ordinarily see the slicing-for-eating all at once.  This phenomenology motivates the claim that action perception is \u201csmart\u2019\u2019 (Siegel 2017): its content is already richly structured.  The \u201cnecessity\u2019\u2019 debate concerns the sub-personal mechanisms that generate this smart content: does the visual system need help from the motor system, in the form of resonance, to present the goal as visually available?\n\nCall Resonance\u2013Necessity (RN): For any subject S and action A performed by another agent, S perceives A as goal-directed only if S\u2019s motor system engages in a state that simulates performing A.  RN is stronger than the weaker facilitation claim (RF) that resonance merely improves accuracy or speed.  Our question is whether RN is true.\n\n\n\n3.  The positive case for necessity  \n\n3.1.  The mirror neuron argument  \nThe initial neurophysiological discovery seemed to show a direct coding of others\u2019 actions in motor terms.  These neurons are said to be \u201cgoal-sensitive\u2019\u2019 because many fire selectively when the observed movement achieves a particular distal end (e.g., grasp-to-eat vs. grasp-to-place).  Hence, Appearances of goal-directedness map onto motor representations, not onto purely visual ones.  The natural inference: if such neurons are the only cells carrying that goal information, then without them the visual system would be blind to goals.\n\n3.2.  The developmental prediction argument  \nNewborns can imitate tongue protrusion and, by four months, match seen and executed grasps.  Advocates argue that shared motor representations bootstrap the infant\u2019s nascent capacity to recognise others\u2019 goals before language or theory-of-mind abilities emerge.\n\n3.3.  The interference argument  \nTranscranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) disrupting premotor cortex allegedly impairs participants\u2019 accuracy in judging whether an observed reach aims at a near or far object.  Because the manipulation targets motor cortices rather than visual ones, the drop in performance is taken as evidence for necessity.\n\n3.4.  The evolutionary efficiency argument  \nA single representational format\u2014motoric\u2014economises on neural resources.  If the brain already contains fine-grained encodings of grasp, pinch, or kick for controlling one\u2019s own body, it is cost-effective to reutilise them for perception, rather than evolve a parallel visual code for others\u2019 actions.  Necessity follows if this reuse is mandatory.\n\n\n\n4.  Empirical and conceptual challenges to necessity  \n\nIf RN is correct, three empirical predictions follow.  (P1) Where resonance is absent or compromised, goal-perception should fail.  (P2) Whenever resonance occurs, goal-perception should co-occur.  (P3) There should be no cases of intact goal-perception dissociated from resonance, or vice-versa.  The literature now supplies numerous violations of each prediction.\n\n4.1.  Neuropsychological dissociations  \n\na.  Ideomotor apraxia.  Patients with left-hemisphere damage often cannot execute purposeful actions (poor motor programs) yet can recognise videos of such actions and can state their goals.  Their resonance ought to be minimal\u2014their own motor repertoire is impaired\u2014yet perception of goal remains.  \n\nb.  Superior temporal sulcus (STS) lesions.  Some patients have the opposite profile: they exhibit impaired action recognition but preserved imitation.  Here resonance (motor programming) appears intact; what is damaged is a higher-order visual area.\n\nc.  Autism spectrum disorder.  Individuals with autism sometimes show reduced mu-suppression (an EEG index of mirror activity), yet many can accurately describe goals.  Recent meta-analyses find no robust correlation between mirror-network activity and behavioural measures of action understanding across ASD cohorts (Hamilton 2020).\n\n4.2.  Behavioral evidence in atypical or non-resonant contexts  \n\na.  Cross-effector and tool use perception.  I can readily see what a violinist is doing despite being unable to simulate his bow grip; spectators unfamiliar with chopsticks still perceive \u201cpicking up sushi\u2019\u2019; we understand a dog pushing open a door even though we lack tails or snouts.  Human-dog cases are especially damning: our motor repertoire does not include tail-wagging, yet the wag\u2019s communicative goal is plainly visible.\n\nb.  Impossible-for-us actions.  Computer animations depicting biologically impossible joints (an arm bending backwards) can still present clear goals (e.g., \u201chanding over a cup\u201d).  Because we cannot simulate the trajectory, resonance should fail, yet perception succeeds.\n\nc.  Point-light displays.  Johansson\u2019s minimal dot patterns convey \u201ckicking a ball\u2019\u2019 despite lacking shape detail helpful for motor simulation (no grasp aperture, muscle tension).  The reverse is also observed: MT area noise dots produce auto-kicking illusions even when TMS knocks out M1 excitability.\n\n4.3.  Infants and non-human animals  \n\nA wealth of infant work demonstrates goal-attribution to mechanical pincers (Woodward 1998) and animated geometric shapes (Gergely & Csibra 2003) long before the infant could possibly perform analogous movements.  Similarly, dogs discriminate intentional vs. accidental human actions, and macaques track the \u201cwhat for\u2019\u2019 of robots that operate outside their motor capabilities.  Unless we postulate exotic cross-species motor resonance, these data show that action understanding overgenerates motor similarity.\n\n4.4.  Direct neurophysiological evidence  \n\nThe original mirror-neuron interpretation has been tempered by findings that (i) many F5 neurons encode purely kinematic parameters rather than goals, and (ii) neurons in visual regions such as STS code goal-identity prior to premotor areas (Hafri, Wood & Scholl 2018).  This temporal precedence challenges the causal arrow from motor to perceptual coding.\n\n4.5.  Conceptual objections  \n\nNecessity conflates the metaphysical and the epistemic.  Even if motor simulation offers the quickest epistemic route for the observer, it does not follow that the property of being goal-directed metaphysically depends on the observability of motor equivalence.  An amputee with congenital limb absence grasps others\u2019 goals via environmental regularities; thus motor equivalence cannot be a constitutive condition on the perceptibility of those goals.\n\nMoreover, invoking necessity risks a regress.  For one to simulate an action as a grasp-to-drink, one must already possess a motor program that structures the command hierarchy of sub-goals (lift-cup, tilt-cup, swallow).  If perception of a higher-level goal depended on evoking an antecedent motor representation of that very goal, the model would be circular: you need to know what the action is in order to simulate it, but simulation is supposed to generate that very knowledge.\n\nTaken together, these considerations rebut predictions P1-3 and undermine RN.\n\n\n\n5.  What, then, does motor resonance contribute?  \n\nAbandoning necessity does not relegate resonance to epiphenomenal status.  Several integrative roles survive the critique:\n\n5.1.  Prediction.  Forward models in motor cortex generate expectations about how a chord progression will end or how a tennis swing will unfold.  Such anticipatory coding can speed perceptual processing, as evidenced by sharper detection thresholds when participants\u2019 motor plans align with observed actions (Stadler et al. 2012).\n\n5.2.  Disambiguation under uncertainty.  When visual input is noisy, motor hypotheses can \u201cfill in\u2019\u2019 missing parameters (Kilner 2011).  Functional MRI shows premotor activity rising with increasing occlusion of the action trajectory, consistent with compensatory recruitment.\n\n5.3.  Social coupling.  Resonance underlies contagious yawning, mimicry, and entrainment, phenomena that bolster cooperation and empathy.  These functions are orthogonal to the recognition of goal-directedness yet socially invaluable.\n\n5.4.  Learning.  Action observation activates mirror circuits that drive synaptic plasticity, facilitating skill acquisition (observational learning).  Seeing the expert\u2019s swing primes one\u2019s own motor pathways for subsequent practice.\n\nAll four roles are compatible with resonance being modulatory rather than constitutive of goal-perception.\n\n\n\n6.  A pluralist framework: multiple routes to action understanding  \n\nThe empirical landscape favours a dual-route model.  One route is \u201cvisual-conceptual\u2019\u2019: specialised visual areas (STS, LOTC) extract kinematic patterns, object affordances, and environmental context to classify actions and assign goals.  The other is \u201cmotor-predictive\u2019\u2019: premotor and parietal regions covertly reproduce observed movements, providing efference-copy-like predictions.  The routes interact but retain partial independence, explaining dissociations.\n\nGibsonian ecological theory lends philosophical articulation: actions are seen in terms of affordances, perceivable directly from optic flow specifying object-goal relations (cup-grasp-for-drinking).  Motor experience fine-tunes sensitivity to these invariants but is not constitutively required.  Conversely, enactivist views (No\u00eb 2004) may stress the motor basis of perception, but even they typically endorse bodily skills as enabling rather than logically necessary conditions.  Thus the pluralist can subsume portions of ecological and enactivist insights without committing to RN.\n\n\n\n7.  Answering objections  \n\nNecessity theorists might press three residual worries.\n\n7.1.  The redundancy objection: If a purely visual route exists, why does the brain waste energy on resonance?  Reply: prediction, social coupling, and learning supply non-redundant payoffs.\n\n7.2.  The developmental objection: infants\u2019 early goal-perception is best explained by motor mapping because other cognitive resources are immature.  Reply: newborns\u2019 sensitivity to eye-gaze, causal motion, and statistical regularities furnish alternative resources.  Moreover, cross-effector evidence (pincer robots) appears at four months, before the infant possesses those motor templates.\n\n7.3.  The phenomenological objection: \u201cI feel myself in the other\u2019s movement; surely that feeling is intrinsic to perceiving her goal.\u201d  Reply: Introspective salience need not track necessity.  The \u201cmotor empathy\u2019\u2019 may be an attentional gloss added by resonance, much as colour saturation is a gloss on wavelength; but we can perceive shape in achromatic scenes regardless.\n\n\n\n8.  Conclusion  \n\nMirror-based motor resonance is an elegant, influential mechanism, but the accumulated empirical record and conceptual analysis show it is not a sine qua non for perceiving goal-directed actions.  One can, and routinely does, grasp the goals of others whose movements are unperformable, whose effectors differ radically, or whose kinematics defy simulation.  Resonance nonetheless plays valuable predictive, pedagogical, and affiliative functions that complement a primarily visual-conceptual route.  The upshot is a pluralistic, non-reductionist understanding of social perception: to see another\u2019s goal is to register a nexus of kinematic, contextual, and affordance-based cues; motor resonance enriches that registration but is dispensable.  Philosophically, this vindicates a modest direct-perception thesis while preserving the embodied spirit of enactivist insight.  Good science often unseats tempting necessities, replacing them with nuanced contingencies and collaborations\u2014and so it is here.\n\n\n\nWord count \u2248 2,055", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 6, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 3087, "reasoning_tokens": 192}
{"question_id": "Smortchkova-SeeingGoalDirectedness-2020", "question": "Some philosophers and cognitive scientists have argued that motor resonance\u2014the mapping of another's action onto one's own motor repertoire\u2014is a necessary condition for perceiving goal-directed actions. On this view, one is able to perceive others' goal-directed actions only to the extent that one is able to simulate them with one's own motor system. Is motor resonance necessary for the perception of goal-directed actions, or can goal-directed actions be perceived independently of resonance mechanisms?", "answer": "Motor resonance and the perception of goal-directed action:\nIs simulation required?\n\n1. Orienting the problem  \n\nWhenever we watch another person reach for a cup, perform a tennis serve, or tap a rhythm on a desk, two quite different explanatory projects tempt philosophers and cognitive scientists. One is behavioural: explain how we visually segment the bodily movement, pick out its teleological structure, and anticipate its likely outcome. The other is neural: explain, in terms of brain mechanisms, why the movement appears to us as \u201cfor\u201d something rather than as a mere kinematic trajectory.  \n\nThe discovery of \u201cmirror\u201d or \u201caction-matching\u201d neurons in the premotor and parietal cortices of macaques and humans offered an elegant link between the two projects. If part of my motor system automatically fires in a way that mirrors your action, then perhaps that resonance constitutes my understanding of what you are doing. A strong reading of this suggestion\u2014defended by Rizzolatti, Gallese, and many simulation theorists\u2014states a necessity claim:\n\nNecessity thesis (NT): Perceiving an episode as a goal-directed action requires mapping that episode onto one\u2019s own motor repertoire; without such covert simulation, the event cannot be experienced as goal-directed.\n\nThe rival position rejects that tight link:\n\nIndependence thesis (IT): Goal-directedness can be perceived (or at least cognised) in the absence of motor resonance; resonance may enrich or speed perception, but it is not constitutively required.\n\nThe dialectic is not merely empirical. A purely empirical dispute could be settled by showing, for instance, that patients lacking resonance capacities nevertheless perceive goals. But NT is sometimes motivated by deeper, philosophical convictions: that we can recognise mindedness only by re-enacting it, that cognition is fundamentally embodied, or that perception is inextricably tied to the motoric possibilities of the perceiver. To evaluate NT, therefore, we must examine both the empirical evidence and the conceptual scaffolding that seems to support it.\n\nMy contention will be that NT overstates its case. Motor resonance contributes significantly to our sensitivity to goal-directed actions, but it is neither necessary in principle nor in fact. I shall argue for this conclusion in five steps:\n\n2. Clarify the target phenomenon.  \n3. Present the empirical and philosophical arguments in favour of NT.  \n4. Expose conceptual and empirical counterexamples that undermine necessity.  \n5. Sketch alternative mechanisms by which goal-directedness can be detected.  \n6. Conclude with a pluralist account: resonance is one route among several, and its importance varies with context, task, and developmental stage.\n\n2. What is it to perceive a goal-directed action?\n\nSaying that an action is \u201cgoal-directed\u201d is already an interpretive commitment: we ascribe to the agent an end or telos toward which the bodily motion is ordered. Philosophically, two distinctions matter.\n\na. Perceptual vs. inferential uptake. Some theorists reserve \u201cperception\u201d for informational pickup that is relatively automatic and non-discursive, contrasted with higher-level inference. Others allow that perception can be cognitively penetrated by belief and background knowledge. For NT to be interestingly true, resonance must be shown to be the constitutive basis even of direct, low-level perception, not merely one among many sources for higher-order judgments.\n\nb. Personal-level vs. subpersonal-level explanation. Saying that \u201cI perceive the action as goal-directed\u201d is a personal-level claim. Saying that \u201cmy premotor cortex resonates\u201d is subpersonal. NT is a bridging thesis: it asserts that the latter is (part of) the realizer of the former. But bridging need not be one-to-one; multiple realizability across individuals, species, and technologies is a live possibility.\n\n3. The case for necessity  \n\n3.1 Neural and behavioural correlations.  \nObserving others\u2019 actions reliably activates one\u2019s own premotor and inferior parietal regions, largely overlapping those involved in execution. TMS applied to those regions slightly impairs performance on tasks such as predicting the end-point of a reach. Infants\u2019 mu-rhythm suppression correlates with their ability to anticipate goal states in looking-time paradigms. These facts suggest\u2014but do not alone establish\u2014a causal role.\n\n3.2 Lesion studies.  \nPatients with lesions in inferior frontal or parietal areas sometimes show deficits in \u201caction understanding\u201d tests (for instance, matching a picture of a completed goal to a short video of an ongoing action). In such cases, the motor system seems to matter more than strictly visual areas, which bolsters NT\u2019s claim that resonance is not merely epiphenomenal.\n\n3.3 Developmental motor constraints.  \nBetween 6 and 9 months, infants who become able to reach and grasp objects also show upticks in their capacity to identify similar goals in others. Sommerville and Woodward famously found that letting 3-month-olds practice \u201csticky-mittens\u201d grasping procedures accelerates their sensitivity to the goal structure of adult reaches. NT interprets these findings to show that motor competence is a prerequisite for goal perception.\n\n3.4 Philosophical embodiment arguments.  \nGallese and Goldman deploy a broader philosophical narrative: traditional \u201cTheory-Theory\u201d approaches picture the observer as a detached cognitive scientist inferring hidden mental states from observable behaviour. Simulation Theory, by contrast, claims that we reuse our own cognitive architecture to model the other\u2019s states. Mirror neurons supply the neural underpinning. If the mind is embodied, then recognising intentionality without motoric embedding would be like seeing colour without activating colour-sensitive photoreceptors.\n\nTaken together, these lines of evidence and argument yield an attractive, unified picture. Yet necessity is a strong word. To defend NT we must show (i) that whenever goal-directedness is perceived, resonance is active; and (ii) that when resonance is absent or neutralised, goal perception is impossible. The next sections challenge both conjuncts.\n\n4. Counterarguments: resonance is not necessary  \n\n4.1 Conceptual counterexamples  \n\na. Observing actions beyond one\u2019s motor repertoire  \nImagine I watch an octopus twist its tentacles through a narrow tube to retrieve a crab. Even adult humans have no motor routines anything like multi-arm, hydrostatic limb control. Yet I can effortlessly see that the octopus is reaching \u201cfor\u201d something. Or consider perceiving the goal structure in a falcon\u2019s stoop: rise, tuck wings, accelerate, strike prey. The kinematics are alien, but the telos is transparent to a modestly informed observer. If NT were literally true, humans should be blind to the purposiveness of such movements\u2014which we are not.\n\nb. Instrument-mediated actions  \nSkilled violin playing involves micro-movements that non-violinists cannot imitate. Nevertheless, novices can tell whether the player is tuning, playing a melody, or merely warming up. Again, perception outstrips motor affordance.\n\nc. Reverse cases: motor resonance without goal perception  \nRobotic imitation setups can trigger human mirror systems even when the robot executes random, non-goal-directed movements such as waving an arm in a meaningless trajectory. Here resonance occurs, yet we do not perceive goal-directedness.\n\nThese cases collectively show dissociation: goal\u2013perception can occur without resonance and resonance can occur without goal\u2013perception. Dissociation blocks claims of necessity.\n\n4.2 Empirical counterevidence  \n\na. Congenital motor impairments  \nChildren with congenital muscular or neural disorders that severely limit motor production (e.g., spinal muscular atrophy) nevertheless display typical development in recognising the goals of others\u2019 reaches and gazes, as measured by looking-time preferences and anticipatory eye movements. Because their own motor repertoires are minimal, they provide a natural test of NT; yet they pass.\n\nb. Amputees and limb differences  \nAdults born without upper limbs show robust activation in visual and parietal areas when observing manual actions, but little or no activation in the canonical mirror network. Behaviourally, they score normally on tests of action understanding and goal attribution. A recent fMRI study (Vannuscorps & Caramazza 2016) found that these individuals recruited extra-striate body areas rather than premotor regions for action recognition, demonstrating neural plasticity: the brain finds non-motor routes.\n\nc. Early infancy prior to motor maturation  \nAt 4 months, well before reliable reaching emerges, infants already treat a caregiver\u2019s reach as goal-directed; they look longer when the agent, having consistently grasped object A, suddenly grasps object B instead of reaching to a new spatial location. Woodward\u2019s classic paradigm shows that goal-attribution precedes, rather than follows, competence in the same action.\n\nd. Cross-modal and abstract goal recognition  \nSubjects can detect goals from minimal displays where the agent is a geometric shape (a triangle \u201cchasing\u201d a circle) with which neither motor resonance nor anatomical matching is plausible. These Heider-Simmel stimuli still elicit intentional attributions, complete with emotional tone (\u201cthe big triangle is bullying the little one\u201d), showing that motor matching is not necessary.\n\n4.3 Methodological concerns  \n\nLesion studies and TMS manipulations rarely create complete shutdown of the motor system; they modulate it. The observed deficits therefore warrant, at best, claims about sufficiency or facilitation, not necessity. Moreover, performance drops are typically modest and task-specific; action recognition does not vanish, it merely slows or loses subtlety.\n\nDevelopmental correlations can run both ways. Gaining motor abilities may heighten attention to certain kinematic patterns, increasing learning opportunities; but the correlation does not show that motor representation is the underlying representational format. Infants who succeed earlier thanks to \u201csticky-mittens\u201d training might simply have more practice associating specific visual cues with outcome states.\n\n5. How can goal-directedness be perceived without resonance?\n\nCritics of NT must supply alternative mechanisms. Several, not mutually exclusive, are available.\n\n5.1 Kinematic cues and rational trajectory inference  \nEven simple optic flow contains informative structure about efficiency, acceleration, and directionality. Computational models show that minimal assumptions\u2014constant velocity, shortest path, smooth curvature\u2014allow an observer to infer likely end-points. Csibra and Gergely\u2019s \u201cteleological stance\u201d posits that infants expect agents to act efficiently toward goals given situational constraints. This teleology can be satisfied by pure visual analysis of trajectories without motor rehearsal.\n\n5.2 Affordance perception in a Gibsonian key  \nJames Gibson argued that perception is direct pickup of affordances\u2014possibilities for action in the environment\u2014not internal simulation. On this enactive reading, an agent\u2019s movement reveals what the environment affords her, and perceiving that structure suffices for recognising the action\u2019s point. My ability to grasp the cup is not invoked; rather, the cup\u2019s \u201cgraspability\u201d for the observed agent is perceived in the relational dynamic.\n\n5.3 Conceptual and narrative knowledge  \nHumans possess vast background knowledge about typical behaviours, social practices, and object functions. Seeing a person raise a glass at a wedding may be taken as \u201ca toast\u201d because we possess the concept of toasting, not because we motorically represent glass-raising. This route can operate recursively: if the person\u2019s arm trembles and the glass wobbles, I may infer nervousness or inebriation\u2014states not obviously encoded in motor schemata.\n\n5.4 Predictive coding and abstract generative models  \nContemporary neuroscience increasingly favours predictive processing frameworks in which the brain constructs hierarchical generative models to minimise prediction error. Nothing in that architecture mandates motoric formats at every level. A higher-level node might encode goals in a quasi-propositional code (\u201cAgent wants to grasp apple\u201d) while lower-level nodes encode expected kinematics. In people lacking a motor repertoire, the higher levels may connect directly to visual expectation layers without passing through motor cortex. Resonance is, on this view, a convenient but dispensable shortcut.\n\n5.5 Social and linguistic mediation  \nWe often learn about goals by communication: \u201cShe\u2019s looking for her keys.\u201d Observers primed with such information can spot goal-directedness even in noisy or impoverished displays that do not elicit measurable mirror activity. Language thus opens a route orthogonal to resonance.\n\n6. Philosophical reflection: what kind of necessity?\n\nNT\u2019s defenders sometimes exploit an ambiguity between causal, constitutive, and epistemic necessity.\n\n\u2022 Causal necessity: given human neurobiology, resonance always in fact occurs when goal-perception occurs. Counterexamples from amputees and infancy falsify this claim.  \n\n\u2022 Constitutive necessity: resonance is part of what it is to perceive an event as goal-directed; take it away and you no longer genuinely perceive the telos, even if you can verbally report it. This higher bar is vulnerable to the octopus case: I phenomenally experience the octopus as reaching, yet lack resonant mapping. One could respond that I merely \u201cjudge\u201d but do not \u201cperceive,\u201d but that stipulation strips NT of empirical content.  \n\n\u2022 Epistemic necessity: we can know another\u2019s goal only by simulating it. The Heider-Simmel and linguistic cases refute this too: we gain knowledge of goals without bodily simulation.\n\nHence, under any plausible interpretation of necessity, the thesis fails.\n\n7. A pluralist alternative\n\nThe empirical landscape points toward a multiple-routes model. We possess:\n\nRoute 1: Motor resonance\u2014fast, automatic, delivering rich, kinesthetic predictions, crucial when the observed action closely matches one\u2019s own motor repertoire and when fine-grained anticipation is needed (e.g., cooperative tasks).  \n\nRoute 2: Visual-kinematic heuristics\u2014trajectory extrapolation and efficiency judgments, operating even for unfamiliar effectors.  \n\nRoute 3: Conceptual-semantic schemas\u2014employing background knowledge, object affordances, and social scripts.  \n\nRoute 4: Communicative/language-based cues\u2014utterances, gestures, and conventional signals that directly encode goals.\n\nThese routes interact: resonance can supply priors to visual analysis; conceptual knowledge can modulate resonance by refining goal hypotheses; and language can override misleading motor cues (a mime\u2019s pretend drinking is recognised as pretend because contextual clues trump kinematics).\n\nSuch pluralism is compatible with the Bayesian predictive framework: different evidential channels update a common generative model. The motor system\u2019s contribution is weighted by reliability and cost. For tasks requiring micro-timing\u2014catching a ball thrown by a partner\u2014motor resonance earns high weight. For tasks involving alien bodies\u2014observing a snake strike\u2014visual heuristic channels dominate.\n\n8. Objections and replies  \n\nObjection 1: Even when we observe birds or shapes, the mirror system may still operate abstractly; we just lack the tools to measure it.  \n\nReply: The burden of proof lies on NT. We have direct evidence of preserved goal recognition in the virtual absence of canonical mirror-circuit activation (e.g., congenital limb absence). Unless \u201cmotor resonance\u201d is redefined so broadly that any cortical process counts, NT becomes unfalsifiable.\n\nObjection 2: Cases of congenital impairment may recruit homologous motor circuitry in other effectors (e.g., foot or mouth).  \n\nReply: fMRI shows recruitment of occipito-temporal \u201cbody areas\u201d rather than motor cortex, undermining the homologous substitution hypothesis.\n\nObjection 3: Perhaps goal perception in octopus and bird cases is \u201cinferential,\u201d not genuine perception.  \n\nReply: The phenomenology is immediate and effortless; subjects can anticipate end-points without conscious deliberation, and reaction-time studies demonstrate rapid predictive eye movements. Setting aside terminological stipulations, the functional capacity is demonstrably intact.\n\n9. Conclusion\n\nMotor resonance is real, powerful, and philosophically intriguing. It supports embodied accounts of social cognition, enriches predictive precision in cooperative contexts, and grounds the distinctive phenomenology of \u201cfeeling\u201d the other\u2019s action. Nevertheless, the total body of evidence reveals that goal perception is robustly multi-modal and multiply realisable. Organisms, especially humans, can perceive purposiveness through motor simulation, through purely visual analysis, through conceptual frameworks, and through communicative signals. Motor resonance is therefore not a necessary condition, though it is often a sufficient and useful one.\n\nRecognising this pluralism alleviates an unnecessary tension between embodiment enthusiasts and proponents of more traditional, representation-heavy theories of mind. The motor system is neither the entire story nor an incidental bystander. It is one protagonist in a distributed cast, recruited flexibly according to the demands of the narrative. A mature theory of social perception will map not a single road but a network of paths\u2014all leading, sometimes converging, to our grasp of others as goal-directed, intentional agents.\n\n(Approx. 2,140 words)", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 7, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 3908, "reasoning_tokens": 384}
{"question_id": "Smortchkova-SeeingGoalDirectedness-2020", "question": "Some philosophers and cognitive scientists have argued that motor resonance\u2014the mapping of another's action onto one's own motor repertoire\u2014is a necessary condition for perceiving goal-directed actions. On this view, one is able to perceive others' goal-directed actions only to the extent that one is able to simulate them with one's own motor system. Is motor resonance necessary for the perception of goal-directed actions, or can goal-directed actions be perceived independently of resonance mechanisms?", "answer": "Motor resonance\u2014roughly, the recruitment of one\u2019s own motor system when observing another individual act\u2014has attracted enormous philosophical and empirical interest since the discovery of mirror neurons in macaques nearly three decades ago. A large and influential body of work claims that such resonance is not just a frequent accompaniment of social perception but a necessary condition for it: unless the observer is able, covertly, to map the perceived movement onto his or her own motor repertoire, the movement cannot be experienced as goal-directed. In what follows I argue that this necessity claim cannot be sustained. While motor resonance is an important, oft-recruited resource for interpreting others\u2019 actions, multiple lines of conceptual analysis and empirical evidence show that goal-directed actions can be\u2014and routinely are\u2014perceived in its absence. The stronger thesis of necessity therefore gives way to a weaker, more ecumenical view on which resonance is one component in a pluralistic architecture of social perception.\n\n1. Clarifying the Debate: What Is at Stake?\n\nBefore the arguments can be assessed, three distinctions must be kept firmly in view.\n\n(1) Perception versus inference. To say that an action is \u201cperceived\u201d as goal-directed is stronger than saying that the perceiver can infer or believe it to be so. Perception suggests a phenomenologically immediate, non-inferential grasp of the action\u2019s teleology, whereas inference allows for discursive or reflective mediation.\n\n(2) Necessity versus facilitation. The motor simulation literature frequently slides from the claim that resonance facilitates goal attribution to the more ambitious claim that it is strictly required. The philosophical question here is one of modal force: Must resonance occur for goal perception to be possible at all, or is it merely one among several sufficient routes?\n\n(3) Kinds of resonance. There is \u201cstrict\u201d resonance (isomorphic muscle-specific activation) and \u201cgeneric\u201d resonance (activation anywhere in the motor system, possibly far removed from the effector perceived). The necessity thesis is only interesting if strict resonance is intended; otherwise it borders on triviality, because low-level premotor circuits light up in innumerable contexts and picking out which counts as \u201cresonance\u201d is arbitrary.\n\n2. The Case for Necessity\n\nProponents of the necessity claim marshal three families of arguments.\n\n(a) Mirror-neuron correlations. In both macaques and humans, brain areas active during action execution also activate while watching conspecifics perform the same action. This seems tailor-made for an \u201cembodied simulation\u201d of observed behavior. Moreover, intracranial recordings in epileptic patients show temporally precise resonant firing that precedes recognition of goal completion, suggesting that the motor code leads rather than follows higher-level interpretation.\n\n(b) Developmental studies. Three-month-old infants who are not yet capable of grasping often fail to anticipate the goal of a grasping action; after a few weeks of motor training, they succeed, and this improvement correlates with signatures of corticospinal resonance (e.g., mu-rhythm desynchronization). The resonance theorist infers a causal link: newly acquired motor skills provide the representational vocabulary in which others\u2019 goals can be read.\n\n(c) Pathology and disruption. Adults with ideomotor apraxia or parietal lesions\u2014conditions that compromise one\u2019s own purposeful movement\u2014sometimes show impairments in understanding others\u2019 actions. Similarly, using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to disrupt premotor cortex can retard the recognition of action goals. Taken together, these results are offered as a demonstration that when the motor system is offline, goal perception collapses.\n\n3. Conceptual Problems for the Necessity Claim\n\nThese considerations are impressive, yet they fall short of establishing necessity.\n\nFirst, the familiar \u201ccorrelation is not causation\u201d warning bites especially hard. The fact that motor and perceptual activations are concurrent does not entail that the former is the causal basis of the latter; both may be effects of a common upstream process. The developmental data likewise underdetermine causality: motor practice may simply expose infants to richer proprioceptive and visual statistics that independently tune perceptual circuits.\n\nSecond, the necessity claim exaggerates what it means to \u201clack\u201d a motor repertoire. Motor commands are extraordinarily plastic and hierarchically organized. Even when I cannot execute the precise kinematics of a gymnast\u2019s triple-back handspring, I share higher-order motor primitives\u2014flex-extend, accelerate-decelerate, maintain balance\u2014sufficient to yield some generic resonance. If necessity is satisfied by such abstraction, the thesis becomes trivial; if it is not, the thesis is easily refuted by cases in which no high-fidelity mapping is possible but perception proceeds unimpaired (see section 4).\n\nThird, the claim confuses phenomenology with implementation. Suppose the motor system indeed contributes causally to goal perception in neurotypical adults. That would show it is often used, not that its contribution is conceptually or metaphysically required. A mechanism\u2019s ubiquity is no guarantee of its necessity; we blink when we perceive, yet blinking is not a pre-condition of perception.\n\n4. Empirical Counter-Evidence\n\nThe empirical literature has increasingly turned up dissociations between motor resonance and goal perception.\n\n(a) Congenital or acquired paralysis. Individuals with spinal cord injuries that eliminate voluntary movement below the neck nonetheless display intact recognition of lower-limb actions (e.g., jogging, kicking). Their primary sensorimotor cortex for the legs is functionally disconnected, and yet they perceive goals effortlessly. If strict resonance were necessary, such patients should be blind to leg-based teleology.\n\n(b) Congenital limb absence. People born without arms reliably identify the goal of reaching-and-grasping movements, and their discrimination thresholds for subtle variations in grasp intent are comparable to controls. Neuroimaging often shows activation in parietal visual areas but muted or reorganized premotor activity, confirming that perceptual competence survives radical motor difference.\n\n(c) Tool use and novel effectors. Observers instantly perceive the goal of someone turning a screw with an unfamiliar gyroscopic screwdriver, or of a violinist executing a novel bowing technique, despite lacking any capacity to replicate the action. Even in macaques, mirror neurons generalize only weakly to tool actions; yet humans display crisp goal perception here.\n\n(d) Cross-species perception. Human adults can discern whether a dog is chasing prey or playing, and dogs can differentiate human reaching for an object from merely touching it accidentally. The motor repertoires do not overlap in a way that would support detailed resonance, but goal perception is nevertheless robust.\n\n(e) Infants and abstract animations. In classic studies by Gergely and Csibra, 12-month-olds interpret geometric shapes as pursuing goals when the motion path is the most efficient relative to an obstacle. No opportunity for motor matching exists\u2014the infants cannot simulate the movement of a triangle sliding across a 2-D plane\u2014yet they detect goal-directedness and even look longer when efficiency is violated.\n\nTogether these bodies of evidence show that motor resonance, while common, is not indispensable.\n\n5. Alternative Pathways to Goal Perception\n\nIf resonance is not obligatory, what does support our remarkable sensitivity to others\u2019 goals? Four complementary accounts are prominent.\n\n(1) Direct perception via kinematic cues (Gibsonian affordances). The spatiotemporal profile of a movement\u2014its velocity, curvature, and biomechanics\u2014carries information specifying the distal goal. Seeing a hand shape pre-adjust to object size makes the goal visually obvious; no motor emulation is needed, just sensitivity to invariant patterns.\n\n(2) Teleological reasoning. Gergely and Csibra propose that observers adopt a \u201crationality principle\u201d: agents act so as to minimize cost for achieving goals given situational constraints. Goal perception thus involves evaluating efficiency, not simulating muscular effort. Computational models formalize this as inverse planning in a Bayesian framework; simulation, when it occurs, is over abstract trajectories, not over one\u2019s own motor commands.\n\n(3) Predictive processing. On hierarchical predictive coding views, the brain continuously generates hypotheses about causes of sensory input at multiple levels. Motor areas may participate in this generative loop, but so do parietal and prefrontal areas coding statistical regularities, environmental affordances, and social norms. What matters for perception is the successful suppression of prediction error, which can proceed through weighted contributions from many sources. Lesion or TMS studies arguably show that dampening motor predictions slows error reduction, not that other routes are unavailable.\n\n(4) Linguistic and cultural schemas. Many human actions\u2014writing an email, ceremonial bowing\u2014rely on shared conventions. Understanding them draws on semantic memory and socio-cultural lore, often exceeding anything that can be mirrored at the level of proximal kinematics.\n\n6. A Pluralistic Picture\n\nThe evidence suggests a multilevel, multi-route architecture.\n\n\u2022 Early, feed-forward kinematic analysis provides a rapid, probabilistic guess of likely goals.\n\n\u2022 Motor resonance adds a second wave of constraint, honing predictions where an executable match is available.\n\n\u2022 Higher-order pragmatic and contextual knowledge overlays still further constraints.\n\nThe contribution of any component is context-sensitive. Resonance is most helpful when observed actions fall within the observer\u2019s sensorimotor repertoire, time is short, and contextual clues are sparse. When those conditions do not hold, other systems pick up the slack.\n\n7. Replies to Remaining Objections\n\nObjection 1: Disrupting motor cortex with TMS impairs goal recognition; therefore the motor system is necessary.\n\nReply: Impairment is not elimination. TMS induces transient noise, forcing the perceptual system to rely on less efficient cues. That performance dips under such noise is compatible with sufficiency, not necessity.\n\nObjection 2: Infants\u2019 anticipation of goals tracks their own motor development; hence motor competence begets perception.\n\nReply: The correlation is real but over-interpreted. Motor practice yields richer multisensory statistics, mature attention to object affordances, and parent-mediated social learning. Training confined to observation without execution can produce similar gains, indicating that execution is not crucial.\n\nObjection 3: Phenomenology speaks for resonance\u2014we feel ourselves \u201cdoing\u201d what we watch.\n\nReply: Introspective warmth is unreliable. Phenomenology may reflect post-perceptual imagery or attention to already interpreted events. Moreover, many adults report no motor imagery when understanding abstract or culturally unfamiliar actions, yet comprehension is secure.\n\n8. Conclusion\n\nMotor resonance is a potent and fascinating ingredient of social cognition. Its discovery has catalyzed new experiments, therapies, and philosophical models. Nevertheless, the available evidence and conceptual clarity force us to reject the strong necessity thesis. Goal-directed actions can be, and often are, perceived by agents whose motor possibilities diverge drastically from the actions perceived, or whose motor pathways are temporarily or permanently disabled. Resonance enhances perception when available, but the mind is equipped with a battery of other resources\u2014kinematic attunement, teleological inference, predictive coding, and socio-cultural knowledge\u2014to secure robust goal understanding.\n\nIn short: motor resonance is a useful servant, not a sovereign master, of our capacity to see the purposiveness in other minds.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 8, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 2757, "reasoning_tokens": 384}
{"question_id": "Smortchkova-SeeingGoalDirectedness-2020", "question": "Some philosophers and cognitive scientists have argued that motor resonance\u2014the mapping of another's action onto one's own motor repertoire\u2014is a necessary condition for perceiving goal-directed actions. On this view, one is able to perceive others' goal-directed actions only to the extent that one is able to simulate them with one's own motor system. Is motor resonance necessary for the perception of goal-directed actions, or can goal-directed actions be perceived independently of resonance mechanisms?", "answer": "1. Introduction  \n\nIn contemporary philosophy of mind and cognitive science \u201cmotor resonance\u201d designates a class of neural and bodily processes in which an observer\u2019s motor system becomes active in a way that mirrors, simulates, or reenacts the action currently being witnessed. The paradigm case is the mirror-neuron system (MNS) discovered in macaque area F5 and its presumed homologues in human premotor and parietal cortex. With dazzling rapidity the initial finding was transformed into the more theoretical claim that resonance is not merely an interesting accompaniment of action perception but instead a pre-condition for seeing an event as an intentional, goal-directed action at all. If I watch you grasp a cup, what makes that observation intelligible as \u201cgrasping\u201d (rather than a meaningless spasm) is said to be the fact that, underneath my skull, the very same motor pattern for grasping is covertly emulated.  \n\nThe claim is bold and has wide-ranging implications for social cognition, theory of mind, and even ethics. Yet it is far from uncontroversial. Must the perception of goal-directed actions be mediated by resonance or can such perception occur independently\u2014perhaps on the basis of purely visual, kinematic, or ecological information? I shall argue for the latter. Motor resonance almost certainly facilitates action interpretation in many contexts, and its impairment can impose measurable costs. But resonance is neither necessary in the logical sense (there can be perception without it) nor in the empirical sense (huge swaths of normal action perception proceed in its absence). The case unfolds in six steps.  \n\n2. Clarifying the Target Thesis  \n\nThe \u201cnecessity\u201d thesis can be interpreted in two main ways.\n\nA. Logical necessity: It is conceptually impossible (a contradiction in terms) to perceive an event as goal-directed unless one is covertly simulating it with one\u2019s own motor apparatus.  \n\nB. Empirical necessity: Given the actual make-up of the human perceptual system, resonance processes always occur, or must occur, whenever an observer succeeds in perceiving an action as goal-directed.  \n\nPhilosophers who speak loosely of \u201cnecessary conditions\u201d sometimes slide between the two readings. Only the second is empirically testable; the first is purely conceptual. My strategy will be to (i) question the conceptual link and (ii) survey empirical findings that disconfirm the universal-occurrence claim.  \n\n3. Why Resonance Was Thought Indispensable  \n\nProponents have offered three principal lines of motivation.\n\n3.1. The poverty-of-the-visual-stimulus argument. A moving limb is an underdetermined pattern of pixels or retinal activations. Without supplementing that pattern with something \u201cfrom within,\u201d the story goes, the percept lacks the mark of intentional directedness. The motor system provides that supplement by \u201ctagging\u201d the observed movement with an executable motor plan.  \n\n3.2. The common-coding principle. Wolfgang Prinz and others argue that perception and action share a common representational format; therefore, only by acting-or-potentially-acting can an organism perceive action.  \n\n3.3. Developmental data. Infants begin to distinguish goal-directed reaches from mere flails at roughly the same age that they acquire those reaches in their own repertoire. On a resonance reading, the arrival of the neural circuitry subserving their own grasping confers the conceptual category \u201cgoal\u201d on observed events.  \n\nThese motivations carry weight, but each is defeasible.  \n\n4. The Conceptual Objection: Goal-Directedness Is Ecologically Specified  \n\nThe \u201clogical\u201d necessity claim inherits an intellectual debt to Cartesian internalism: properties such as goal-directedness must be projected by an inner mechanism because they do not reside in the \u201cthin\u201d geometry of the stimulus. Yet an alternative tradition, running from George Herbert Mead through J. J. Gibson to contemporary ecological and enactivist theorists, denies that action perception needs such supplementation. On a Gibsonian account, affordances\u2014action-relevant possibilities\u2014are specified directly in the dynamic structure of the optic array. A hand closing in on a cup along a grasp-appropriate trajectory just is grasping; no motor contagion is needed to endow it with purposiveness.  \n\nThe conceptual moral is not that resonance cannot figure in the perceptual process, but that its presence is not constitutive of perceiving an event as instrumental. One can coherently imagine a creature (e.g., an octopus) seeing a human grasp a cup and registering the event as a goal-directed \u201ctaking\u201d while lacking the motor circuits for a five-fingered precision grip. Nothing contradictory is involved.  \n\n5. Empirical Counter-Evidence  \n\n5.1. Individuals without the relevant motor repertoire.  \n\na) Congenital limb-absence. A striking fMRI study by Vannuscorps and Caramazza (2016) showed that people born without upper limbs not only understand but visually anticipate the kinematics of grasping actions with intact speed and accuracy. Critically, multivoxel pattern analysis revealed no standard mirror-neuron activity in premotor cortex, yet their perceptual judgments were unimpaired.  \n\nb) Locked-in patients. Behavioral work indicates that such patients, though unable to move, can track and predict others\u2019 actions in real time. While some residual motor simulation may remain subcortically, the bulk of cortical motor execution circuitry is offline, undermining the universality claim.  \n\n5.2. Cross-species perception. Cats perceive, stalk, and interpret the goal-directed trajectories of birds in flight, despite lacking the wing-flapping motor program. Similarly, humans easily attribute goals to snakes or drones, although we cannot simulate constricting coils or quad-rotor propulsion.  \n\n5.3. Neurostimulation interference. If resonance were strictly necessary, disrupting the motor system ought to eliminate, not merely slow, goal recognition. TMS over premotor cortex typically yields a \u223c50- to 100-ms delay in action understanding tasks but does not abolish the capacity (Avenanti, Cattaneo, et al. 2013). Partial deficit speaks to facilitation, not necessity.  \n\n5.4. Developmental dissociations. At 3 months, infants with limited grasping skill already treat reaches as goal-directed when the hand literally cannot reach its target due to a barrier, showing \u201cWoodward\u201d preferences. Similarly, 10-month infants who have never walked attribute goals to upright walking agents. The developmental correlation between own-action competence and other-action understanding is real but rough-grained; it allows for many counter-instances.  \n\n5.5. Artificial vision systems. Deep-learning architectures trained on large video corpora now classify goal-directed actions better than chance with no \u201cmotor\u201d pathway at all, thereby serving as a proof of concept that purely perceptual architectures can extract goal structure. While one must not anthropomorphize networks, their performance falsifies the claim of a necessary computational architecture containing motor emulators.  \n\n6. What Resonance Actually Contributes  \n\nThe negative result (not necessary) should not be mistaken for a deflationary verdict on motor resonance tout court. A growing consensus assigns it three supplementary roles:\n\n6.1. Temporal prediction. The internal forward models embedded in motor circuitry excel at extrapolating near-future kinematics under uncertainty. This can tighten perceptual alignment and allow split-second social coordination.  \n\n6.2. Affective attunement. Somatotopic resonance supports empathic feeling of effort, strain, or pain, enriching the qualitative texture of one\u2019s perception. You may see the backhand volley not just as a goal but feel its muscular demand.  \n\n6.3. Learning and calibration. During infancy and skill acquisition, motor resonance may scaffold the mapping from visible trajectories onto abstract action categories, especially where vision alone underdetermines functional possibilities.  \n\nIn short, motor resonance is like stereo sound: highly useful, sometimes immersive, but one can still hear the melody on a mono speaker.  \n\n7. Replies to Remaining Objections  \n\nObjection 1: \u201cEven limb-deficient individuals show activation in premotor cortex when observing action; perhaps the simulation occurs in an \u2018amputated\u2019 format.\u201d  \nReply: The debated papers carefully distinguish visual-motor coupling from canonical mirror coding. Moreover, the activation appears in multimodal association cortex, not primary motor maps somatotopically specific to missing effectors. Without homology, the core resonance thesis loses its bite.  \n\nObjection 2: \u201cThe TMS delays demonstrate that when resonance is weakened, recognition slows; wouldn\u2019t a more powerful disruption wipe it out?\u201d  \nReply: Lesion studies (e.g., left inferior frontal damage) often leave intact spontaneous action recognition while compromising pantomime production. Evolution rarely builds single-points-of-failure into socially crucial capacities. Redundant visual and inferential pathways carry the load when the motor route falters.  \n\nObjection 3: \u201cCross-species cases invoke different action systems with overlapping abstract structures; perhaps the organism simulates at a higher, goal-level rather than effector-level.\u201d  \nReply: But that is to concede the point. The original thesis targeted motor resonance precisely as an effector-specific mapping. A shift to \u201cabstract emulation\u201d moves us into the terrain of cognitive inference, not motor mirroring, and abandons the distinct physiologic signature that gave the resonance claim its explanatory allure.  \n\n8. A Positive Alternative: Teleological and Relational Perception  \n\nIf resonance is not obligatory, what grounds the perception of goals? Two complementary frameworks are promising.\n\n8.1. The teleological stance (Gergely & Csibra). Perceivers tacitly assume agents take the most efficient means to reach desired ends, constrained by environmental affordances. Signatures of efficiency\u2014shortest path, least force, energy minimization\u2014are directly recoverable from spatiotemporal geometry. Such \u201crationality\u201d cues allow observers to tag trajectories as purposeful without simulating the motor routine.  \n\n8.2. Direct relationalism (Chemero, Witherington). Goal perception is neither in the head nor in the stimulus alone but in the relational unfolding of organism-environment dynamics. Seeing a hand move toward a cup against the background of thirst constitutes a cliff of information specifying the \u201cfor-the-sake-of\u201d structure Gibson called the \u201cambient optic array.\u201d  \n\nBoth accounts predict that perception of goal-directedness can be present in organisms with dissimilar or absent motor programs, provided they are attuned to the relevant ecological regularities.  \n\n9. Philosophical Upshot  \n\nWhat hangs on the debate extends beyond empirical psychology. If social cognition always piggybacks on first-person motor simulation, then interpersonal understanding is fundamentally egocentric; we grasp others only by importing them into the frame of our own embodiment. Rejecting necessity loosens this grip and rehabilitates the possibility of genuinely other-directed perception, a point dear to phenomenologists from Scheler to Merleau-Ponty. Moreover, ethical openness to forms of life very unlike our own (artificial agents, animals, drastically disabled persons) finds firmer footing when we grant that goal-directedness can be \u201cread off\u201d their trajectories without presupposing mirrorable sameness.  \n\n10. Conclusion  \n\nMotor resonance is a beautiful discovery and a versatile tool in the brain\u2019s kit for social attunement. Nonetheless, the empirical literature, theoretical analysis, and cross-species considerations converge on a common verdict: resonance is facilitative, not foundational. One can, and frequently does, perceive goal-directed actions independently of simulating them with one\u2019s own motor system.

Is motor resonance necessary for the perception of goal-directed actions, or can goal-directed actions be perceived independently of resonance mechanisms?", "answer": "Motor resonance is one of the most celebrated discoveries of contemporary cognitive science. In macaques and humans alike, the observation of another individual\u2019s reaching, grasping, or kicking is accompanied by covert activity in one\u2019s own motor cortex\u2014activity that, if it were not inhibited, would command one\u2019s own hand or foot to move in just the observed fashion. From the mid-1990s onward this \u201cmirror-neuron system\u201d quickly became the cornerstone of a more general simulationist picture of social cognition. On that picture, action understanding, empathy, and even language comprehension are all functions of an internal emulator that re-enacts the observed behaviour in one\u2019s own sensorimotor circuits. The strongest formulation of the view says more than that motor resonance is useful or typical; it says that resonance is a necessary condition for perceiving goal-directed action at all. If the motor emulator is shut down or if the action lies outside the observer\u2019s motor repertoire, the observer, so the claim goes, cannot truly perceive it as goal-directed.\n\nIs that bold claim defensible? I shall argue that it is not. While motor resonance is an important, and perhaps in some contexts indispensable, contributor to social perception, it is not constitutively necessary for the perception of goal-directed actions. My argument proceeds in five steps. (1) I clarify what the necessity claim amounts to. (2) I rehearse the empirical and conceptual considerations that motivate it. (3) I marshal counter-evidence drawn from atypical populations, cross-species perception, and the perception of technologically mediated or otherwise non-resonant actions. (4) I sketch alternative, non-motoric models of goal attribution that account for these data. (5) I diagnose the residual appeal of the necessity claim and suggest a more modest, integrative role for resonance in action perception.\n\n1. What would it mean for resonance to be necessary?\n\nNecessity, in this context, is a modal and explanatory notion. The thesis is not merely that motor activation happens to accompany successful action perception, nor that it improves accuracy or speed. Rather, it is that a subject S\u2019s being able to perceive another\u2019s behaviour B as goal-directed metaphysically depends on S\u2019s being able to token a corresponding motor representation M of B. If no such mapping is available\u2014if the relevant neurons are lesioned, paralysed, or developmentally absent\u2014genuine perception of goal-directedness is supposed to be impossible, not merely impaired.\n\nNotice two consequences. First, the thesis concerns perception, not merely belief or theoretical inference. The simulationist typically holds that what is at stake is an early, quasi-perceptual level at which the target\u2019s arm-movement already appears as a reaching for the cup, rather than as a kinematic trajectory that is later interpreted. Second, the thesis is a biconditional in practice: it is not enough that resonance be sufficient, it must also be inescapable whenever perception of goal-directedness occurs.\n\n2. Why think resonance is necessary?\n\nThe strongest empirical argument comes from interference studies. In human TMS experiments, applying magnetic pulses to premotor cortex while subjects observe grasping actions slows their ability to discriminate the goal object or to predict action kinematics. This suggests a causal contribution of the motor system to perceptual processing. Intracortical recordings in epilepsy patients show mirror-like neurons firing in lockstep with observed actions down to parametric details such as grip aperture. Developmentally, infants who are still motorically incapable of certain actions (e.g., raking a toy with a hook tool) appear not to anticipate the goal of those actions when others perform them, and their anticipation improves once they can perform the action themselves. Such findings support what we might call the \u201ccalibration\u201d version of the resonance thesis: motor development tunes perceptual systems for social understanding.\n\nThere is also a conceptual argument, indebted to Gibsonian and enactivist themes. On this view, to see an action as reaching for a cup is to perceive it under a motor intentional description. The very content of action concepts is grounded in the agent\u2019s own sensorimotor repertoire. Goal states, so construed, are nothing over and above patterns of possible bodily movements oriented toward distal objects. If one lacked a repertoire of reaching, there would be no representational resource with which to articulate the observed movement as reaching. In the slogan: no motor know-how, no action know-that.\n\n3. Empirical counter-evidence\n\nDespite their prima facie force, both empirical and conceptual arguments overstate their case. A wide range of findings show that goal-directedness can be perceived in the absence of any plausible motor correspondence.\n\n3.1 Congenital and acquired motor deficiencies\n\nIndividuals born without upper limbs (amelia) cannot physically perform grasping, yet fMRI studies reveal typical activation of higher-level visual areas when they watch others grasp, and their behavioural performance in action recognition tasks is normal. More strikingly, these individuals often show little or no activation in classical motor resonance areas, yet they describe and anticipate others\u2019 grasps as accurately as control subjects. Similarly, patients with advanced amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, who have lost nearly all voluntary motor control, continue to recognise and predict the goals of actions they can no longer perform.\n\n3.2 Cross-species perception\n\nHumans effortlessly perceive the goal-directedness of a dog chasing a ball, a squirrel leaping from branch to branch, or a hummingbird hovering to sip nectar. Few humans possess the proprioceptive patterns needed to emulate those actions. The same point can be turned around: dogs can track human pointing and fetch a thrown stick, yet their forelimbs cannot duplicate our manual actions. If goal perception required motor resonance, such cross-species understanding would be mysterious.\n\n3.3 Novel or impossible actions\n\nParkour experts may run up walls and flip over railings in ways novices cannot imagine executing, yet spectators at a parkour competition have no difficulty seeing that the athlete is attempting to vault a gap or scale a wall. Audiences at a science-fiction movie instantly perceive the telekinetic \u201cforce pull\u201d used by a Jedi character as directed toward levitating an object, even though no human can perform or has ever performed that action. The kinematics violate the constraints of our motor system, but the goal is perceptually clear.\n\n3.4 Tool use and technological mediation\n\nHumans manipulate joysticks, computer mice, and robotic surgical tools whose distal effects are not linearly mappable onto limb motion. Observers can nonetheless see the surgeon\u2019s motions through a robotic interface as directed toward suturing tissue in a patient metres away. The visual system extracts an abstract, end-effector-centred representation rather than a literal body-centred one, bypassing the need for mirror-matching.\n\n3.5 Neonatal and infant data revisited\n\nNew-borns a few days old react with longer looking times when a hand repeatedly reaches for object A and then unexpectedly reaches over the same trajectory to object B. Such dishabituation is taken to indicate goal attribution. Yet these neonates lack mature reaching skills and thus presumably lack the required motor \u201ccalibration\u201d. More generally, motor development and goal perception proceed in tandem but not in lockstep: infants can attribute goals for some actions (e.g., an abstract block climbing a barrier to reach another block) before they possess the motor ability to reproduce any analogue of the action.\n\n4. Alternative architectures for goal perception\n\nIf motor resonance is not strictly necessary, what mechanisms might suffice? At least three families of models answer that question.\n\n4.1 Teleological reasoning with rationality constraints\n\nOn the so-called \u201cteleological stance\u201d (Gergely & Csibra) observers implicitly assume that agents act efficiently to realise desirable outcomes given environmental constraints. Perceiving a block detour around a barrier is enough to trigger an expectation that, once the barrier is removed, the block will take a straight path. This inference can be implemented with domain-general causal pattern detectors without invoking motor emulation.\n\n4.2 Purely visual predictive coding\n\nPredictive-processing models treat action perception as hierarchical Bayesian inference over visual dynamics. Generative models of optic flow and object mechanics forecast the unfolding trajectory, while prediction-error signals refine the model. A \u201cvisuodynamic emulator\u201d can play the same computational role that a motor emulator would, yet its representational basis is visual, not motoric. Indeed, neuroimaging shows that superior temporal sulcus, posterior parietal cortex, and motion-sensitive area MT dynamically encode others\u2019 action goals without obligatory recruitment of ventral premotor areas.\n\n4.3 Affordance-based ecological perception\n\nGibson\u2019s ecological psychology insists that what perceivers pick up are affordances\u2014opportunities offered by the environment\u2014in virtue of structured energy arrays. One may perceive that a handle affords pulling, that a gap affords leaping, without simulating the muscle activations needed to achieve those affordances. Crucially, goal perception is direct in the sense that no intervening representation of the agent\u2019s motor commands is required.\n\n5. A modulatory, not constitutive, role for resonance\n\nHow, then, should we interpret the abundant evidence that motor interference can hamper action perception and that motor training can improve it? The simplest hypothesis is that resonance mechanisms are facilitative rather than constitutive. They provide fast, resource-efficient predictions when a matching motor schema is available but yield gracefully to purely perceptual or inferential routes when it is not. On this \u201cmulti-route\u201d architecture, the brain exploits whichever source of information is most reliable, combining them in a Bayesian fashion.\n\nConsider an analogy with speech perception. Audiovisual congruence (the McGurk effect) shows that lip-reading contributes to phoneme identification, yet no one would claim that vision is necessary for speech perception: blind people understand spoken language perfectly well. Motor resonance stands to action perception as lip-reading stands to audition: it supplies redundant cues whose relevance varies with context.\n\nSuch an interpretation accommodates apparent counter-examples without denying the importance of motor systems. Congenitally limb-absent individuals may recalibrate other neural circuits to subserve functions ordinarily handled by mirror neurons. Cross-species perception may rely more heavily on high-level predictive vision, whereas action perception within one\u2019s own species can piggyback on shared biomechanics for greater speed and precision. Infants\u2019 facilitation after mastering a new action may reflect statistical learning that binds motor and visual codes, yielding more accurate predictions, without entailing that the visual code by itself was ever impotent.\n\n6. Philosophical implications\n\nPhilosophers attracted to the strong resonance thesis often do so because it promises a naturalistic account of how conceptually rich contents (goals, intentions) enter perceptual consciousness. By anchoring such contents in sensorimotor representations, the thesis seems to dissolve the problem of how we \u201cread minds\u201d. Yet the foregoing evidence indicates that goal perception does not reduce to body-schema matching. The worry that we must either embrace simulation or lapse into intellectualist theorising is a false dichotomy.\n\nIndeed, rejecting necessity can free us from an overly anthropocentric view of intentionality. If perceiving goal-directedness does not hinge on mapping the other\u2019s joints onto ours, then the very concept of a goal must be more abstract\u2014linked to environmental regularities, causal constraints, and statistical patterns. This opens the door to a pluralistic ontology in which plants turning toward light or bacterial chemotaxis can be treated as goal-directed in a sense continuous with, though not identical to, human agency. The motor-centric picture artificially restricts intentionality to beings that resemble us kinematically.\n\nThere is also a deeper epistemological insight. Perception, including social perception, is opportunistic. It exploits whatever cues are available\u2014visual, auditory, proprioceptive, motoric, contextual\u2014to construct predictions about the world. No single cue is privileged a priori. In light of that, the necessity thesis seems rigidly modular in a way that cognitive science increasingly rejects.\n\n7. Objections and replies\n\nObjection 1: Interference studies show causal necessity: disrupting motor cortex disrupts goal perception.\n\nReply: Interference reduces but does not abolish performance; subjects remain above chance. Moreover, TMS effects may spread to adjacent parietal regions that encode kinematics visually, complicating the interpretation. Causal contribution is not equivalent to necessity.\n\nObjection 2: Without motor resonance infants fail to anticipate action goals; thus resonance is developmentally prior.\n\nReply: Correlation is not dependency. Motor and perceptual development are mutually scaffolded. Mastery of an action offers new proprioceptive data that can refine visual predictions, but the underlying visual system can already represent goals using simpler heuristics, as demonstrated by neonate studies.\n\nObjection 3: Mirror neurons fire even for abstractly similar actions (e.g., grasping with a tool), suggesting an abstract matching mechanism, not a literal joint-by-joint mapping. Hence resonance can in principle cover all cases.\n\nReply: The more abstract the mapping becomes, the less it earns the name \u201cmotor resonance\u201d in the sense of muscular simulation. At some point we are merely positing a supramodal action code shared by motor and perceptual areas\u2014which is just to concede that the motor component is dispensable.\n\n8. Conclusion\n\nMotor resonance is a versatile and evolutionarily elegant mechanism for making others\u2019 behaviour intelligible. It leverages the embodied knowledge encoded in our motor system to generate rapid, fine-grained predictions of observed kinematics. Nevertheless, it is not the sole pathway to perceiving goal-directed action, and it is certainly not a strict prerequisite. Evidence from limb-absent individuals, cross-species cognition, tool-mediated action, impossible or novel feats, and infant looking paradigms cumulatively undermine the necessity claim. Philosophically, this invites a pluralistic, cue-integration view of social perception: humans, like other animals, are epistemic opportunists who flexibly combine motor simulation, visual statistics, contextual inference, and teleological reasoning to make sense of what others are up to.\n\nA mature theory of action perception should therefore treat motor resonance as one component in a heterogeneous architecture. Future research should focus less on adjudicating winner-take-all debates and more on mapping the conditions under which each route predominates, and on elucidating the computational principles by which the brain arbitrates among them. In so doing we can preserve the genuine insights of the mirror-neuron revolution without lapsing into an untenable motor chauvinism about social cognition.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 10, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 3490, "reasoning_tokens": 448}

Introduction  \n\nSeeing another person reach for a cup, tie her shoelaces, or type on a keyboard typically strikes us as the direct perception of an action that is \u201cfor\u201d something: grasping, fastening, communicating. For roughly three decades, many philosophers of mind and cognitive scientists have explained this capacity by appealing to motor resonance (often operationalised in terms of mirror-neuron activity). On what I shall call the Resonance Necessity Thesis (RNT), perceiving that an observed movement is goal-directed requires mapping that movement onto one\u2019s own motor repertoire; in the absence of such resonance, the action can be seen as mere bodily motion but not as directed to a goal.  \n\nIn what follows I argue that RNT is too strong. Motor resonance is neither sufficient nor necessary for perceiving goal-directed actions. It undoubtedly plays an important contributory role in typical adult perception, yet converging evidence from developmental psychology, neuropsychology, comparative cognition, and phenomenology shows that goal-directedness can be visually apprehended even when resonance is seriously impaired or altogether absent. Rather than grounding action understanding solely in motor simulation, a pluralistic account is needed\u2014one that integrates perceptual kinematics, contextual information, learned statistical regularities, and higher-level inferential resources.  \n\n2. Clarifying the central concepts  \n\n2.1 What is motor resonance?  \n\nMotor resonance refers to automatic, subpersonal activations in the observer\u2019s motor system that mirror, to some degree, the kinematic pattern currently being watched. In humans, this is typically measured through single-cell recording (in rare neurosurgical patients), EEG mu-rhythm suppression, TMS-evoked motor potentials, or fMRI BOLD responses in premotor and parietal cortices. Importantly, resonance is not conscious imagery; it is an on-line motor facilitation that occurs within 100\u2013300 ms of stimulus onset.  \n\n2.2 What is meant by \u201cperceiving goal-directed action\u201d?  \n\nTo perceive goal-directedness is to visually experience an unfolding bodily movement as oriented toward an outcome or effect, as opposed to merely noticing the geometrical properties of motion. Such perception can be relatively low-level: infants as young as five months dishabituate when a hand that has repeatedly reached for object A suddenly shifts to object B, even if the path travelled is the same (Woodward, 1998). The relevant phenomenology is of an agent \u201caiming at\u201d something, not of a detached string of Cartesian coordinates.  \n\n3. The positive case for the Resonance Necessity Thesis  \n\nProponents of RNT advance three main arguments.  \n\n3.1 The developmental argument  \n\nNewborns imitate tongue protrusion and mouth opening (Meltzoff & Moore, 1977). Because they lack explicit conceptual resources, imitation seems to require a direct perception-action mapping. The claim is that mirror-like mechanisms are present from the outset and scaffold later capacities to recognise goals.  \n\n3.2 The kinematic ambiguity argument  \n\nMost bodily movements are spatially underdetermined with respect to their goals: the same hand trajectory could be a grasp, a reach-past, or a self-scratch, depending on proximal kinematics. By internally simulating how I would move to achieve a certain outcome, I \u201cfill in\u201d what cannot be gleaned from vision alone.  \n\n3.3 The neuropsychological argument  \n\nDisrupting premotor areas via TMS impairs observers\u2019 ability to judge the goal of an observed grasp (Avenanti et al., 2007). Conversely, stimulating them enhances goal discrimination. This causal link suggests that motor activity is indispensable rather than epiphenomenal.  \n\n4. Reasons to doubt necessity  \n\nEach of these arguments can be countered by empirical and conceptual considerations.  \n\n4.1 Motor resonance is neither sufficient nor specific  \n\nMirror-area activation is observed while participants view meaningless pantomimes, or even static images of tools, where no clear goal is present (Grafton et al., 1997). Conversely, people can attribute goals to abstract moving triangles in Heider-Simmel animations (1944) in which the depicted entities have no limbs that correspond to the human motor repertoire. The commonsense impression that one triangle \u201ccoaxes\u201d another is as vivid as the impression that a human hand reaches for a cup, yet motor resonance for triangles is negligible. Thus resonance is not sufficient for goal perception (it can occur without it) nor specific to it (goal perception can occur without resonance).  \n\n4.2 Developmental dissociations  \n\nInfants show differentiated looking patterns that track agents\u2019 goals at five months, but neonatal imitative capacities\u2014if they exist at all\u2014are fragile and specific to certain facial gestures. Moreover, tremor-dominated congenital motor disorders such as arthrogryposis multiplex congenita or spinal muscular atrophy produce severely limited limb control, yet affected children pass standard action-goal tasks (Boria et al., 2009). If motor mapping were necessary, one would expect dramatically reduced sensitivity to goals in these populations.  \n\n4.3 Pathological and experimental lesions  \n\nPatients with limb apraxia, who have lesions in left inferior parietal or premotor areas that are part of the putative mirror system, struggle to execute purposeful actions but recognise others\u2019 goals at nearly normal levels (Negri et al., 2007). Conversely, patients with autism spectrum conditions, sometimes described as having \u201cbroken mirror neurons,\u201d often succeed on explicit goal-recognition tasks once low-level attentional factors are controlled (Hamilton, 2013). In TMS studies, inhibitory stimulation of premotor cortex increases reaction times but does not abolish accuracy, suggesting a modulatory, not obligatory, role.  \n\n4.4 Conceptual and phenomenological considerations  \n\nWhen I watch an experienced pianist\u2019s left-hand arpeggios\u2014movements I cannot perform\u2014I nonetheless see them as directed toward producing musical phrases. My motor repertoire lacks the fine-grained representation needed for internal mimicry, yet perception remains intelligible. Perceptual Gestalt theorists (Koffka, 1935) long ago stressed that we see intentions and meanings \u201cout there\u201d in the visual field. It would be odd if adult observers explicitly or implicitly simulated every action they perceived, including those involving bodily configurations impossible for them (think of a contortionist).  \n\n5. Alternative sources of goal information  \n\nIf not resonance, what enables goal perception? Several non-motor cues are informative.  \n\n5.1 Statistical regularities  \n\nThrough experience we learn that certain body-object relations are highly predictive: a cylindrical grasp followed by arm flexion usually ends in bringing an object to the mouth. Bayesian models (Baker, Saxe & Tenenbaum, 2009) formalise this as the observer\u2019s prior over cost-efficient action plans. No motor mimicry is necessary; visual pattern classification suffices.  \n\n5.2 Environmental affordances and situational context  \n\nThe presence and salience of a target object drastically alter action interpretation. In Woodward\u2019s infant paradigm, repositioning the objects, not altering limb kinematics, triggers surprise. Context thus constrains goal attribution. Similarly, whether a hand movement counts as \u201cgrasping a doorknob\u201d versus \u201csteadying oneself\u201d depends on affordances visible in the scene.  \n\n5.3 Causal necessity and rationality assumptions  \n\nHumans habitually interpret motion through a teleological lens that assumes efficiency given constraints (Gergely & Csibra, 2003). When an agent detours around an obstacle rather than moving straight, observers treat the path as evidence that the agent intends the goal behind the obstacle. Such inference relies on a quasi-rational model of agents, not on reproducing their muscle activations.  \n\n6. How resonance might still matter: a moderate position  \n\nDenying that resonance is necessary does not entail that it is irrelevant. The evidence suggests a contributory, facilitative role.  \n\n6.1 Speed and richness of perception  \n\nMotor-resonant activity may furnish fast bottom-up hypotheses about goals, later refined by context. Its contribution might be most salient under degraded visual conditions, where purely perceptual cues are noisy.  \n\n6.2 Bodily phenomenology and social attunement  \n\nSimulation accounts claim not merely cognitive but empathic benefits: feeling \u201cfrom within\u201d how an action unfolds can ground subtle anticipations, enhancing joint action and coordination. Even if redundant for coarse goal discrimination, resonance could enrich the qualitative texture of social perception.  \n\n6.3 Individual differences and learning  \n\nAthletes and dancers display stronger motor facilitation when observing domain-specific skills, and they are indeed better at predicting those skills\u2019 outcomes (Aglioti et al., 2008). Expertise seems to fine-tune both motor representation and perceptual sensitivity, suggesting interactivity rather than strict dependence.  \n\n7. Assessing the empirical landscape  \n\nTo adjudicate the necessity question, we need paradigms that (i) selectively block or diminish motor resonance while leaving vision intact, and (ii) measure on-line perception rather than post-hoc inference. Current techniques fall short of providing clean dissociations, yet piecemeal evidence points towards sufficiency of non-motor cues.  \n\n7.1 Dual-task interference  \n\nCerqueira et al. (2014) had participants observe grasps while concurrently executing an incompatible motor task. Mu-suppression was reduced, but goal recognition accuracy remained at ceiling, indicating that overt motor engagement is dispensable.  \n\n7.2 Transcranial magnetic stimulation  \n\nAs noted, TMS over premotor cortex elongates reaction time yet seldom reduces accuracy to chance. One interpretation is that resonance feeds a \u201cfast route,\u201d while a slower, visuo-conceptual route can compensate. This mirrors dual-process theories in other domains.  \n\n7.3 Neurodevelopmental disorders  \n\nIf autistic individuals, whose motor faculties are often atypical, nonetheless attribute goals in animated triangles, this counts against strong motoric dependence. The same holds for individuals born without limbs, who still pass false-belief and action-goal tasks (Vannuscorps & Caramazza, 2016).  \n\n8. Philosophical implications  \n\n8.1 Direct perception vs. inferential reconstruction  \n\nRNT has been linked to neo-Gibsonian positions claiming that we literally see others\u2019 intentions. Critics worry that introducing covert motor simulation re-introduces a mediating inference, thus undermining the claim of \u201cdirectness.\u201d If goal perception can piggy-back on attunement to environmental regularities without recourse to internal mimicry, it may be closer to the Gibsonian ideal.  \n\n8.2 The problem of other minds  \n\nSome philosophers hoped mirror neurons provide a naturalistic solution: we know others\u2019 minds by sharing their motor activations. If resonance is not necessary, this solution is at best partial. Yet it also avoids the solipsistic worry that those lacking sufficient motor overlap (infants, amputees, robots) are barred from understanding agency.  \n\n8.3 Embodiment and cognitive extension  \n\nThe debate motivates a nuanced view of embodiment. Motor processes augment, but do not monopolise, social cognition. Perception of action is multi-scale: it spans retina, temporal cortex, parietal reach areas, prefrontal reasoning\u2014all dynamically orchestrated. This resonates with extended-mind theses that resist localising cognition to any single locus.  \n\n9. Synthesis: toward an integrative account  \n\nWe can summarise the evidence as favouring a pluripotent architecture:\n\n\u2022 Bottom-up visual extraction of kinematics and affordances yields an initial, partially specified action representation.  \n\u2022 Parallel motor resonance offers anticipatory scaffolding, useful for real-time interaction but not indispensable for recognition.  \n\u2022 Top-down inferential schemas, incorporating statistical knowledge and teleological principles, refine goal attribution.  \n\u2022 Depending on task demands, any layer can compensate for deficits in another, ensuring robust perception.  \n\nThis architecture predicts specific dissociations. For example, dancers deprived of proprioceptive feedback (through nerve block) would still recognise others\u2019 dance moves visually, yet their ability to synchronise in real time would deteriorate. Likewise, apraxic patients would recognise goals but make poor kinematic predictions\u2014a pattern borne out in the literature.  \n\n10. Conclusion  \n\nPerceiving goal-directed action is a fundamental human skill, supported by multiple, partially redundant mechanisms. Motor resonance is an important piece of this mosaic: it speeds up prediction, grounds bodily empathy, and becomes increasingly fine-tuned with expertise. Nevertheless, it is not a sine qua non. Infants, patients with profound motor deficits, and neurotypical adults observing impossible or non-biological motions all attest that goal perception can proceed when resonance is weak or absent.  \n\nTherefore, the strong version of the Resonance Necessity Thesis should be rejected. A more defensible Moderate Facilitation Thesis states: motor resonance facilitates, enriches, and sometimes accelerates the perception of goal-directed actions, but alternative visual, contextual, and inferential routes are sufficient when resonance fails.  \n\nAccepting this conclusion frees us from an overly motoric picture of social cognition and encourages an interdisciplinary program that studies how vision, motor simulation, and abstract reasoning cooperate to make the world of intentional action intelligible.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 11, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 2884, "reasoning_tokens": 64}

Introduction  \n\nA person sees someone reach past a coffee mug and move directly toward a phone. In ordinary experience the movement is perceived as aiming at the phone: the observer does not merely see an arm moving through space but sees an intentional trajectory organized around a distal goal. Since the 1990s, the discovery of \u201cmirror\u201d neurons and the rise of motor-simulation theories have suggested an explanation of how this perceptual enrichment might occur. According to the strong \u201cmotor-resonance\u201d thesis (Gallese 1998; Rizzolatti & Sinigaglia 2010), to perceive an action as goal-directed, the observer must covertly map the observed kinematics onto her own motor repertoire, re-using her motor control circuits to simulate how she would bring about the same outcome. The motor match, proponents claim, is a necessary pre-condition for goal-ascription: without it the observed movements would remain a meaningless flux of bodily translation.  \n\nIs that claim correct? I shall argue that motor resonance, while empirically robust and often helpful, is not a necessary condition for the perceptual apprehension of goal-directed actions. The case against necessity combines (i) conceptual distinctions among enabling, facilitating, and constitutive conditions; (ii) empirical findings from populations in whom motor resonance is absent or impaired but action understanding persists; (iii) developmental evidence indicating that goal perception precedes motor competence; and (iv) theoretical considerations favoring pluralist or predictive-processing accounts over single-mechanism explanations. The cumulative weight of these considerations shows that resonance is better interpreted as one of several converging cues the visual system can exploit, rather than as a sine qua non of goal-directed perception.  \n\n2. Clarifying the Target Phenomenon  \n\n2.1 What is \u201cperceiving a goal\u201d?  \nPerceiving an action as goal-directed is not merely labelling it as such later, but experiencing its spatio-temporal unfolding as organized around an outcome. Philosophers have called such perception \u201cteleological\u201d (Nanay 2013), \u201caction-space structuring\u201d (Shepherd 2017), or \u201caffordance realism\u201d (Gibson 1979). It is a content-rich, temporally extended perceptual state, and\u2014crucially for present purposes\u2014plausibly subpersonal: it can guide eye movements, prime expectations, and occur in preverbal infants or non-human animals.  \n\n2.2 Necessary vs. facilitative conditions  \nA condition C is necessary for phenomenon P if P cannot obtain without C. It is merely facilitative if P can obtain in the absence of C, even if more slowly or less reliably. The resonance thesis we are evaluating states a necessity claim: without motor mapping, no perception of goals. Evidence that goal perception occurs when resonance is absent or disabled suffices to refute that thesis, even if resonance normally accompanies or enhances such perception.  \n\n3. The Empirical Case for Necessity and Its Limits  \n\n3.1 Positive evidence for a resonance-goal link  \nThere is abundant evidence that (i) observing hand or mouth actions elicits activity in overlapping premotor and parietal regions implicated in executing those actions (Fadiga et al. 1995); (ii) disrupting this activity via transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) or cooling produces small but reliable decrements in tasks such as identifying the end state of a grasp (Avenanti et al. 2007); (iii) individual differences in motor proficiency correlate with accuracy or speed in action recognition, e.g. expert dancers recognize ballet moves faster than non-experts (Calvo-Merino et al. 2005). Developmentally, \u201csticky-mittens\u201d training that gives three-month-olds new motor abilities also improves discrimination of others\u2019 reaches (Needham et al. 2002).  \n\nTaken together, these findings show that motor activation is often engaged during action observation and that interfering with it can degrade performance. Yet they do not by themselves establish necessity. The interference studies yield partial decrements, not abolitions; moreover, facilitative correlations do not entail constitutive dependence.  \n\n3.2 Counter-evidence from impaired or absent motor systems  \n\na. Congenital limb absence. Vannuscorps & Caramazza (2016, 2019) studied adults born without upper limbs. Despite having no motor representations of hand movements, these participants performed at ceiling on tasks requiring identification of goals, distinguishing biological from non-biological motion, and predicting whether a grasp would succeed. fMRI showed activation in visual areas coding hand shapes but no M1 or premotor resonance. Goal perception survived.  \n\nb. Locked-in and spinal cord injury patients. People with high spinal lesions lack efferent motor commands below the lesion, yet EEG and behavioral tests reveal intact perception of others\u2019 leg and foot goals (H\u00e9tu et al. 2010).  \n\nc. Amputees with phantom-limb paralysis. de Vignemont (2020) reports that chronic amputees unable to voluntarily move a phantom hand nonetheless judge others\u2019 manual intentions normally.  \n\nd. Developmental disorders. Individuals with apraxia, or with Moebius syndrome (facial paralysis), exhibit spared recognition of facial expressions and their communicative goals (Miall & Gowen 2007).  \n\ne. Species without matching effectors. Domestic dogs differentiate purposeful human pointing from accidental gestures (Szetei et al. 2003) though their limb kinematics differ dramatically from ours and cannot be motor-mapped in any detailed sense.  \n\nThese convergent lines indicate that the ability to simulate an action motorically, or even to possess a corresponding effector, is not required to perceive its goal.  \n\n3.3 Developmental precedence of goal perception over motor competence  \n\nFrom five months of age, infants look longer when a hand that previously reached for ball A now moves toward location A but contacts ball B, suggesting violation of goal expectation (Woodward 1998). Similar experiments with newborn chicks and fish show sensitivity to goal structure in animations before the animals can perform comparable actions (Csibra et al. 2016). Even newborn humans seem to discriminate self-propelled, agentive trajectories from random motion (Simion et al. 2011). These capacities arise earlier than the fine-grained motor skills whose resonance would be needed to simulate the observed acts, undercutting the necessity claim.  \n\nProponents reply that rudimentary motor schemas are available prenatally or that resonance may be covertly present before overt control appears. But the temporal gap\u2014months before grasping or crawling\u2014is large, and neural mirroring circuits for manual action are still immature. Moreover, the chick and fish cases show that even animals with markedly different motor systems apply goal attribution to purely geometric displays, making a resonance explanation implausible.  \n\n4. Alternative Mechanisms for Goal Perception  \n\n4.1 Teleological reasoning from the \u201cPrinciple of Rational Action\u201d  \nGergely & Csibra (2003) propose that infants (and adults) adopt a default interpretive stance: if an entity moves efficiently (i.e. by the shortest available path) toward an external target, treat the movement as goal-directed. Geometric violation of efficiency triggers surprise independently of one\u2019s own motor repertoire. This \u201crational imitation\u201d framework explains why changing the environmental constraints (e.g. lifting an obstacle) alters goal expectations even for purely abstract agents (two animated shapes).  \n\n4.2 Visual-kinematic cues and statistical learning  \nHumans are exquisitely sensitive to velocity profiles that betray intentional control\u2014e.g. bell-shaped speed curves, minimum-jerk constraints, and sudden corrections (Flanagan & Johansson 2003). Such kinematic signatures can be learned and recognized through purely perceptual practice. Neurophysiologically, the posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) computes these patterns and feeds them forward to mentalizing areas (Pelphrey et al. 2004). Crucially, these circuits operate when no matching motor pathways exist, as in visually impaired mimicry studies.  \n\n4.3 Predictive-processing architecture  \nWithin hierarchical predictive-coding models (Clark 2016; Kilner et al. 2007), the brain maintains multilevel generative models. Motor areas issue \u201cactive\u201d predictions, but higher visuospatial or abstract state levels can generate their own forecasts. If lower-level motor states are unavailable or suppressed, higher levels can still minimize prediction error by recruiting visual trajectories and environmental affordances. Resonance is one optional pathway among several for reducing error; its absence slows convergence but need not prevent correct goal representation.  \n\n4.4 Phenomenological affordance perception  \nFrom a Gibsonian perspective, observers directly perceive affordances\u2014possibilities for action\u2014without representing motor commands (Gibson 1979). Seeing a hand move toward a graspable object in a context that makes grasping relevant affords the perception of \u201creaching-for.\u201d This ecological approach predicts intact goal perception in subjects lacking specific motor abilities, provided they have preserved sensitivities to the environmental layout.  \n\n5. What Explains the Correlation Between Motor Proficiency and Action Understanding?  \n\nIf resonance is not necessary, why does disabling it sometimes impede goal perception? Two explanatory options remain compatible with its merely facilitative role.  \n\n1. Noise-reduction and disambiguation. Observed kinematics in real life are often noisy or occluded. Motor simulation supplies priors that fill in missing parameters, improving recognition speed. TMS interventions increase uncertainty, slowing responses, yet they do not abolish the capacity altogether.  \n\n2. Shared resource efficiency. Neural reuse theories (Anderson 2010) posit that evolution co-opts pre-existing circuits for new purposes. The motor system is well-suited to predict biomechanic constraints of biological movement. Recruiting it is metabolically efficient but not obligatory; other circuits can shoulder the task when necessary, though perhaps with a performance cost.  \n\n6. Philosophical Reflections on Simulation and Understanding  \n\n6.1 Over-extension of the \u201cas if\u201d fallacy  \nThe resonance thesis rests on the intuition that to grasp another\u2019s intention, I must \u201cput myself in her shoes.\u201d Yet empathy and understanding can proceed via multiple routes. Philosophical simulationism (Goldman 2006) over-generalizes from cases where motor or affective enactment enriches comprehension to the claim that it is constitutively required. The empirical evidence reviewed above reveals that \u201cas if\u201d enactment is one strategy among many.  \n\n6.2 The pluralist stance on Action-Perception coupling  \nAnalogous to pluralism in theory-of-mind research (Nichols & Stich 2003), we should accept that the cognitive system possesses both low-level resonance routines and higher-level inferential routines, each adequate under varying circumstances. Such pluralism dissolves the urge to identify a single necessary mechanism.  \n\n6.3 Implications for enactive and embodied theories  \nDoes denying necessity undermine embodied cognition? Not at all. Embodiment can matter without monopolizing the explanans. The body provides a scaffold and a bias, not a straitjacket. Action perception remains richly embodied\u2014eye movements, posture, and visceral responses still shape it\u2014even if an internal motor copy is not mandated. An appropriately nuanced embodied cognition perspective will allow for dis-embodied informational channels as well.  \n\n7. Possible Objections and Replies  \n\nObjection 1: TMS studies show that disrupting M1 or premotor areas compromises not only speed but accuracy of goal discrimination; therefore resonance is required.  \nReply: The impairments are partial and reversible; subjects perform above chance. Moreover, TMS can produce off-target interference in adjacent visual or parietal cortex, so attributing deficits solely to resonance is problematic. A necessary condition, once absent, should eliminate the phenomenon.  \n\nObjection 2: Congenital limb-absent individuals may develop vicarious resonance via other effectors (e.g. mapping hand grasps onto mouth grasps).  \nReply: fMRI work demonstrates no compensatory mirroring in mouth areas for hand actions in these participants. Behavioral success occurs without detectable motor mapping.  \n\nObjection 3: What about subtle aspects of goal perception, such as inferring hidden intentions or complex tool use? Perhaps resonance is necessary there.  \nReply: The thesis under scrutiny concerns perceiving goal-directed action per se. More sophisticated mindreading likely recruits prefrontal or semantic systems; appealing to resonance here conflates different tasks. In any case, neuropsychological data from motor-impaired subjects indicate intact comprehension of complex instrument-mediated actions.  \n\n8. Synthesis: A Conditional-Independence Model  \n\nWe can now sketch a reconciliatory picture. Let P be the event of correctly perceiving goal G in observed action A. Let R be the engagement of the resonance mechanism, and V a set of purely visual-inferential cues. Empirically:  \n\u2022 P can occur with R present (normal adults) or R absent but V present (congenital limb-absent).  \n\u2022 Disrupting R while leaving V intact modestly reduces P\u2019s probability.  \nTherefore R is neither necessary nor sufficient; it is a probabilistic enhancer. Formally, P(R | V) > P(\u00acR | V), but P(\u00acR | V) remains appreciable. Such a conditional-independence model aligns with Bayesian brain theories and respects both sorts of data.  \n\n9. Broader Consequences  \n\nRejecting resonance as necessary matters for several domains:  \n\n\u2022 Robotics and AI. Engineers can build artificial systems sensitive to human goals without endowing them with humanoid limbs to \u201cmirror\u201d actions; statistical and predictive models suffice.  \n\n\u2022 Clinical rehabilitation. Therapies should not presume that restoring motor simulation is the only route to social understanding; visual and cognitive training may compensate effectively.  \n\n\u2022 Aesthetics and performance. Spectators can appreciate dance or athletic skill even when physically incapable of reproducing the moves; choreographers may rely on visual-kinematic expressivity more than observer motor empathy.  \n\n10. Conclusion  \n\nThe seductive idea that we must internally rehearse every action we see to understand its point overstates the role of motor resonance. Evidence from clinical populations, early development, cross-species comparisons, and computational modeling demonstrates that the perceptual attribution of goals can proceed in its absence. Resonance mechanisms surely make a contribution: they quicken, refine, and sometimes emotionally color our reading of others\u2019 movements. But they are best thought of as situated helpers in a diverse toolkit rather than as foundational pillars.  \n\nIn philosophy of mind and cognitive science, clinging to necessity claims in the face of pluralistic data risks impeding theoretical progress.

{"question_id": "Smortchkova-SeeingGoalDirectedness-2020", "question": "Some philosophers and cognitive scientists have argued that motor resonance\u2014the mapping of another's action onto one's own motor repertoire\u2014is a necessary condition for perceiving goal-directed actions. On this view, one is able to perceive others' goal-directed actions only to the extent that one is able to simulate them with one's own motor system. Is motor resonance necessary for the perception of goal-directed actions, or can goal-directed actions be perceived independently of resonance mechanisms?", "answer": "Motor resonance burst onto the philosophical and scientific scene with the discovery, in the early 1990s, of mirror neurons in macaque premotor and parietal cortex\u2014cells that fire both when the monkey executes an action such as grasping and when it observes another individual doing the same. Since then, many theorists have proposed that human observers perceive other people\u2019s actions by \u201cmapping\u201d the observed movement onto their own motor repertoire. Call this the Motor Resonance Thesis (MRT):\n\n(MRT) Perceiving another\u2019s action as goal-directed requires the activation of one\u2019s own motor representations of that action; without such resonance, the very perception of its goal-directedness is impossible.\n\nIn what follows I argue that MRT overstates the role of resonance. While motor resonance often facilitates, enriches, and predicts observed action, it is not a necessary condition for perceiving goal-directedness. I develop this claim in six steps: (1) clarifying what counts as \u201cperception\u201d of goal-directed action; (2) summarizing the empirical case for MRT; (3) presenting empirical and conceptual counter-evidence; (4) distinguishing facilitation from necessity; (5) sketching alternative mechanisms of goal ascription; and (6) drawing broader philosophical lessons about social cognition.\n\n1. What is it to perceive an action as goal-directed?\n\n\u201cGoal-directedness\u201d can refer to at least three things.\n\na. Kinematic regularities: stereotyped patterns such as straight-line reaches or bell-shaped velocity profiles.\n\nb. Instrumental structure: the fact that a movement is directed toward an external object or state of affairs\u2014for instance, grasping a mug in order to drink.\n\nc. Teleological significance: the higher-order practical rationale that makes the movement intelligible (\u201cShe\u2019s grasping the mug in order to drink because she desires coffee and believes it contains coffee\u201d).\n\nThe stronger claims about MRT usually target levels (b) or (c): the idea is that one cannot even visually register that an arm-trajectory is \u201cfor\u201d getting the mug unless one runs a motor simulation of that trajectory. If the claim were only about level (a), MRT would be trivial; perceiving any motion at all obviously recruits visual motion areas, and motor activation might tag along epiphenomenally. So the philosophically interesting part of MRT is the proposal that motor simulation is constitutive of ascribing instrumental or teleological significance.\n\n2. The empirical case for necessity\n\nProponents of MRT cite four main lines of evidence.\n\n2.1 Neural co-activation. Dozens of fMRI and TMS studies reveal overlapping activation in premotor, parietal, and somatosensory cortices when people act and when they watch others act. Suppressing these areas via TMS can impair fine-grained discrimination of observed grasps, and the degree of motor activation often predicts how well participants anticipate action endpoints.\n\n2.2 Developmental timing. Six-month-old infants show motor system activity (measured by EEG mu-rhythm suppression) when watching adults reach and grasp. Since the infant\u2019s own ability to perform the observed action typically emerges just before or around the same age, some infer a causal role: new motor skills bootstrap the perception of the same skill in others.\n\n2.3 Cross-modal prediction. Motor models are good at predicting occluded or noisy kinematics. When subjects watch an action that becomes visually occluded, premotor activity tracks the \u201cfill-in,\u201d suggesting that the observer\u2019s motor system continues the movement internally.\n\n2.4 Pathology. Patients with apraxia or focal motor cortex lesions sometimes show deficits in recognizing others\u2019 actions, especially fine tool use, seemingly in proportion to their execution deficits.\n\nTaken together, these data show that the motor system is often engaged and sometimes functionally implicated in fine-grained action perception. But do they prove necessity? Not yet, because necessity requires showing that without resonance a normal perception of goal-directedness is impossible. The next sections bring out difficulties for such a strict view.\n\n3. Empirical and conceptual counter-evidence\n\n3.1 Congenital limb absence. Individuals born without arms never acquire motor programs for upper-limb actions. Yet they can effortlessly recognize, describe, and anticipate other people\u2019s hand actions, show typical sensitivity to biological motion displays, and pass theory-of-mind action tasks. fMRI studies find no activation in their absent \u201chand\u201d motor cortex, but intact action recognition. This is a direct refutation of MRT\u2019s necessity claim unless one stipulates ad hoc that they somehow \u201csimulate\u201d with residual shoulder programs or covert imagery\u2014claims for which no solid evidence exists.\n\n3.2 Abstract and tool-mediated actions. Human observers can perceive goals in actions far outside their own motor repertoire: a violinist\u2019s bowing, a basketball dunk, or a forklift\u2019s lifting operation. Even if partial resonance occurs (e.g., grasp components), the relevant goal structure often involves forces, timings, or machinery the observer\u2019s motor system cannot literally simulate. Yet the perception of goal-directedness remains robust.\n\n3.3 Non-biological stimuli. Since the classic Heider\u2013Simmel (1944) animation of moving triangles, a vast literature shows that minimal, geometric displays can elicit rich goal and intention attributions. Infants attribute purposeful pursuit to a small circle chasing another. Adults are exquisitely sensitive to contingent or rational motion in dots on a screen. No plausible motor resonance is available here: there is no effector, musculature, or articulated joint pattern to mirror. Still, observers experience the motion as directed-to-a-goal.\n\n3.4 Residual perception under resonance disruption. TMS or transcranial direct-current stimulation targeting premotor cortex impairs fine-grained discrimination (e.g., lifting a heavy vs light object) but seldom abolishes the basic judgment that the actor is reaching for the cup or intends to drink. The deficit is quantitative, not qualitative. If motor activation were strictly necessary, we would expect categorical loss.\n\n3.5 Phylogenetic breadth. Many animals detect goal-directedness in ways that do not appear to rely on sophisticated motor maps. Newly hatched chicks preferentially follow stimuli that move self-propelled and change direction contingently\u2014proto-teleological cues that pre-date cortical motor resonance mechanisms.\n\n3.6 Dissociation between kinematics and goals. Agents can pursue the same distal goal by radically different bodily means (think of turning on a light with a finger, elbow, or tongue). Observers effortlessly see all variations as \u201cfor\u201d lighting the lamp despite wildly different motoric overlaps, suggesting representation at a more abstract level.\n\n4. Facilitation vs. necessity\n\nTo salvage MRT in the face of these counter-examples, some defenders revise the thesis:\n\n(MRT*): Motor resonance is not strictly necessary, but it is the primary, default, or most efficient route to perceiving goals; when absent, observers rely on slower, inferential pathways.\n\nThis \u201cfacilitation\u201d version is considerably weaker and may well be true. Yet once MRT is demoted from \u201cnecessary\u201d to \u201chelpful,\u201d the dialectical burden shifts: one must specify what non-motor mechanisms subserve the perception of goal-directedness and explain why these mechanisms are sometimes sufficient. Without such a specification, MRT* risks vagueness.\n\n5. Alternative (and complementary) mechanisms\n\nPhilosophers and cognitive scientists have proposed several non-motor sources of goal attribution.\n\n5.1 Teleological reasoning. Gergely and Csibra (2003) argue that infants adopt a \u201cteleological stance\u201d: they apply a principle of rational action, representing agents as bringing about goals by efficient means given situational constraints. This capacity operates over abstract variables such as paths, obstacles, and affordances, not detailed motor commands. Evidence: twelve-month-olds infer that if an agent crosses a costly barrier for object A rather than B, she values A more, and they do so even when the agent is a self-propelled blob.\n\n5.2 Causal structure extraction. Scholl and Tremoulet (2000) emphasize that certain spatiotemporal patterns\u2014self-propulsion, continuous acceleration, goal-directed change in direction\u2014serve as perceptual \u201csignatures\u201d of agency. These signatures are detected visually, rapidly, and without reliance on motor simulation; indeed, they work for events impossible to enact (e.g., instantaneous right-angle turns).\n\n5.3 Statistical learning and predictive coding. From infancy, humans track contingencies between agents, objects, and outcomes. Bayesian predictive models can ascribe goals by inferring the latent variable that best accounts for observed motion, without requiring motor resonance. The motor system itself may implement one predictive hierarchy, but visual or parietal areas can implement others, so the brain has multiple, partially redundant inferential engines.\n\n5.4 Linguistic and conceptual resources. Adults possess rich propositional knowledge (\u201cPeople drink coffee to stay awake\u201d) and can deploy it to interpret actions well beyond their bodily repertoire. That knowledge is not encoded in motor format; it is discursive and combinatorial. When I see a pianist strike an appoggiatura, my understanding crucially depends on musical concepts, not my paltry piano skills.\n\n5.5 Affective appraisal. Sometimes the relevant goal is not instrumental but affective (\u201cHe\u2019s hugging her to console her\u201d). Such understanding relies on emotional resonance, face processing, or socio-cultural norms more than on simulating arm trajectories.\n\n6. Philosophical implications\n\n6.1 Direct social perception vs. inferential theory\n\nSome philosophers (e.g., Gallagher, 2008) argue that we directly perceive others\u2019 intentions, not by inference but in the \u201cexpressive\u201d pattern of their embodied action. MRT is often enlisted as the mechanistic underpinning of such direct perception: resonance tunnels the other\u2019s intention into my own bodily awareness. But if goal perception can occur in the absence of resonance, the epistemology of direct perception must invoke other forms of embodied attunement or environmental invariants\u2014not merely motor simulation.\n\n6.2 Embodied cognition and pluralism\n\nRejecting the necessity of resonance does not entail embracing a disembodied, purely propositional picture. Rather, it suggests a pluralist architecture: motor, perceptual, affective, and conceptual systems each contribute, dynamically and context-dependently, to social understanding. The motor system\u2019s contribution may be crucial when rapid, fine-grained anticipation is needed (e.g., catching a ball thrown by someone), less so when deliberative explanation is at stake (e.g., interpreting a complex trick play in American football).\n\n6.3 Marr\u2019s levels and explanatory humility\n\nAt the computational level, perceiving goal-directedness involves generating hypotheses about future states that an agent is trying to realize. Multiple algorithmic strategies can implement this computation: motor simulation is one, statistical inference over trajectories another. The brain likely implements a hybrid solution because each strategy has trade-offs: motor simulation offers rich temporal accuracy but is effector-specific; statistical inference is abstract but less precise. Explanatory humility counsels against identifying any one strategy with the whole function.\n\nConclusion\n\nMotor resonance is neither epiphenomenal nor dispensable. It furnishes the observer with a fast, embodied way of predicting the kinematics of familiar actions, sharpening perceptual discrimination and enabling deft interaction. Nonetheless, the perception of goal-directedness\u2014understood as registering that an action is for the sake of some outcome\u2014does not hinge on simulating that action in one\u2019s own motor cortex. Empirical cases of congenital limb absence, abstract stimuli, cross-effector generalization, and ectopic actions demonstrate that goal perception can proceed unimpaired when resonance is impossible. Theoretical considerations point toward multiple complementary mechanisms: teleological reasoning, causal feature extraction, statistical learning, conceptual knowledge, and affective appraisal. The most plausible upshot is a pluralist model in which motor resonance is a powerful but non-exclusive route to understanding others, embedded within a broader cognitive ecology of social perception. That pluralism honors the embodied insights of MRT while avoiding the overreach of claiming necessity, and it meshes with a broader philosophical stance that sees the mind as a distributed, flexible system rather than a single-route simulator.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 13, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 2936, "reasoning_tokens": 384}

Is motor resonance necessary for the perception of goal-directed actions, or can goal-directed actions be perceived independently of resonance mechanisms?", "answer": "1. Introduction  \n\nSince the discovery in the early 1990s of \u201cmirror\u201d neurons in the macaque premotor cortex, the idea that we understand other agents\u2019 actions by internally reenacting them has become philosophically and empirically influential. This family of views\u2014variously labeled \u201csimulation theory,\u201d \u201cmotor resonance theory,\u201d or the \u201cdirect\u2013matching hypothesis\u201d\u2014holds that when I watch you grasp a cup, my own grasp-related motor circuits are covertly activated; that activation allegedly endows the observed movement with its goal-directed meaning. A strong version of the claim says that motor resonance is necessary for perceiving actions as goal-directed at all. In what follows I argue that this necessity claim is too strong. Although motor resonance is often recruited, and may enhance the acuity or speed of goal attribution, perceptual access to goal-directed actions is neither conceptually nor empirically hostage to resonance mechanisms.  \n\n2. Clarifying the target claim  \n\nWe must distinguish four theses that are sometimes run together.  \n\na) Sufficiency. If motor resonance occurs, the observer will perceive the movement as goal-directed.  \nb) Enhancement. Motor resonance improves the perceptual discrimination or prediction of others\u2019 action goals.  \nc) Typicality. In normal adult human observers, motor resonance usually accompanies the perception of goal-directed action.  \nd) Necessity. Perceiving a movement as goal-directed requires motor resonance; without it, such perception cannot occur.  \n\nThe question before us concerns (d). Rejecting (d) is compatible with accepting (a)\u2013(c). My strategy is to defend a weaker view: motor resonance is one among several informational routes to goal perception, but the visual system can, in principle and practice, extract goal-directedness without recourse to motor simulation.  \n\n3. Conceptual considerations  \n\n3.1 Goal-directedness and teleology  \n\nA bodily movement is goal-directed when it is naturally interpreted under a \u201cteleological\u201d description: the trajectory is governed by, or at least reliably correlated with, the attainment of a distal state (e.g., the cup being at the mouth). From an ecological standpoint (Gibson 1979), goal-directedness is relational: it concerns the agent/environment system rather than the agent\u2019s internal motor commands. Hence, what makes a reach a \u201cgrasp\u201d is not its motor specification but its lawful relation to an environmental affordance\u2014something graspable. A perceiver could, in principle, detect that relation directly, by registering the end-state toward which the trajectory is constrained.  \n\n3.2 Perception vs. representation  \n\nNecessity theorists often write as though, unless the observer\u2019s brain constructs a motor representation of the action, she could only see a kinematic shell devoid of intentional content. But ordinary perceptual psychology is replete with cases in which high-level properties (causation, animacy, emotional expression) are visually registered without the perceiver\u2019s having an internal \u201creplica\u201d of the cause. I see a collision as causal without computing the forces involved; I see a facial expression as fearful without contracting my own Zygomatic muscles. The burden is therefore on motor-necessity theorists to show that action goals constitute a special class of properties that cannot be perceptually specified in the stimulus.  \n\n4. Empirical evidence against necessity  \n\n4.1 Cases of impaired or absent motor resonance with spared goal perception  \n\na) Congenital motor impairments. Individuals born without upper limbs (Vannuscorps & Caramazza 2016) nonetheless identify others\u2019 hand actions and their goals with normal speed and accuracy. Neuroimaging shows no activation in canonical hand mirror areas\u2014plausibly because the observers lack the relevant motor programs\u2014yet behavioral performance is intact.  \n\nb) Spinal cord injury and locked-in syndrome. Patients who have permanently lost efferent control below the neck show reduced or absent resonance but retain the capacity to recognize distal goals of actions they can no longer perform (Saison et al. 2021).  \n\nc) Developmental trajectory. Newborns at 3 months can differentiate goal-directed from random reaches by looking-time paradigms, despite the fact that their own reaching skills are minimal and motor resonance is still immature (Woodward 1998; Sommerville et al. 2005).  \n\n4.2 Cross-species perception  \n\nHumans readily perceive goal-directedness in non-conspecifics\u2014dogs chasing a ball, birds building nests\u2014even though we possess no motor programs for canine galloping or avian flight. Conversely, dogs appear to track human pointing goals without the ability to perform pointing gestures themselves. If resonance were necessary, such cross-species goal attribution would be inexplicable.  \n\n4.3 Degraded or delayed resonance  \n\nTMS studies that transiently disrupt premotor mirror areas reduce the amplitude of motor-evoked potentials but leave participants\u2019 explicit judgments of action goals largely unchanged (Avenanti et al. 2013). Reaction times may slow, but accuracy remains high. The most natural interpretation is that resonance contributes heuristically but is not indispensable.  \n\n5. How the visual system can specify goals without simulation  \n\n5.1 Kinematic invariants  \n\nTrajectory curvature and velocity profiles contain telltale signatures of goal-constrained motion. A grasp decelerates as it approaches an object; a kick accelerates at mid-swing; an avoidance maneuver has distinct jerk minima. Visual areas such as STS extract these invariants (Puce & Perrett 2003) independently of motor cortex. Computational models trained only on video input but lacking motor efference (e.g., deep-learning action classifiers) correctly categorize goals, showing in silico the sufficiency of visual information.  \n\n5.2 Contextual affordances  \n\nObservers integrate scene context: a hand moving toward a mug on a cluttered desk is interpreted as \u201cgrasping for drinking,\u201d whereas the same kinematics near a sink suggests \u201cwashing.\u201d Neuroimaging localizes such affordance processing to parietal and temporal cortex, not premotor resonance areas (Schubotz & von Cramon 2009).  \n\n5.3 Teleological inference mechanisms  \n\nGergely and Csibra\u2019s \u201cteleological stance\u201d experiments demonstrate that infants treat agents as goal-directed if their paths are the most efficient relative to environmental constraints, even when the agents are geometric figures. Intuitively, the infant reasons: given obstacle O and target T, the least-cost path is P; therefore the figure that chooses P is goal-directed toward T. No motor correspondence is available, yet goal perception arises.  \n\n6. Reply to four pro-necessity arguments  \n\n6.1 The argument from phenomenology  \n\nSome simulation theorists claim that resonance explains the distinctive immediacy of action perception. We do not neutrally \u201cinfer\u201d your goal; we \u201cjust see\u201d what you are doing. But immediacy alone does not locate the source of content in motor areas. I immediately see an apple as red without simulating redness. Direct perceptual phenomenology is compatible with visual, amodal, or motor sources.  \n\n6.2 The argument from predictive timing  \n\nResonance models excel at explaining how observers anticipate the time-course of another\u2019s action (Kilner et al. 2007). However, prediction and perception dissociate: I may accurately predict when the ball will strike the bat without misperceiving its trajectory. Indeed, professional athletes often develop motor mimetic strategies to improve prediction, but novices can still perceive goals without them.  \n\n6.3 The argument from neural correlation  \n\nfMRI studies show mirror-system activation during action observation. Yet correlation is not causation. When I listen to speech, my lips may twitch, but the auditory cortex does the heavy perceptual lifting. The lesion evidence cited in section 4 indicates that such motor activity is dispensable.  \n\n6.4 The argument from evolutionary parsimony  \n\nResonance is claimed to offer a cheap solution to social cognition: reuse one\u2019s own motor plans to decode others. Even if true, parsimony is a heuristic, not a proof. Evolution could have furnished multiple partially redundant pathways: a fast, motor-based heuristic and a slower, context-based visual route. Redundancy is common in biological systems.  \n\n7. Positive account: pluralistic architecture  \n\nI propose a dual-route model.  \n\nRoute 1: Visual-affordance path  \n\u2022 Stimulus processed in occipito-temporal cortex (EBA, pSTS) extracts body form and motion.  \n\u2022 Parietal areas compute affordance relations between effector and object.  \n\u2022 Temporal-parietal junction integrates kinematics and context to yield a percept of the agent pursuing goal G.  \n\nRoute 2: Motor-resonance path  \n\u2022 Observed effector activates corresponding motor schema in premotor cortex via visuo-motor links.  \n\u2022 Forward models generate predictions about upcoming kinematic states.  \n\u2022 Predictions feed back to visual areas, sharpening perception and timing.  \n\nThe two routes converge but either can, in principle, operate alone. In typical adults they cooperate, affording robust goal perception; in individuals lacking motor representations, Route 1 suffices.  \n\n8. Philosophical ramifications  \n\n8.1 Direct perception vs. theory-laden seeing  \n\nIf goal perception can proceed through purely perceptual analysis, then \u201cseeing an intention\u201d need not be metaphorical. The objector who insists that what is seen must be spatially present mistakes the ecological concept of information: distal properties can be visually specified when they project law-like structure into the optic array.  \n\n8.2 Embodied cognition\u2014how embodied?  \n\nMotor resonance research has fueled the embodied cognition movement. But embodiment does not entail that every cognitive achievement reduces to sensorimotor simulation. A more discerning embodiment recognizes multiple bodily resources\u2014motor, proprioceptive, interoceptive\u2014that play modulatory, not foundational, roles.  \n\n8.3 Social cognition and mindreading  \n\nIf motor resonance is not necessary for goal perception, then higher-level mentalizing (belief, desire attribution) is even less likely to be motor-dependent. Mirror neurons may scaffold early, concrete goal understanding, but representing false beliefs requires distinct, perhaps language-dependent, mechanisms.  \n\n9. Objections and replies  \n\nObjection 1: The lesion and congenital-limb-loss evidence only shows that explicit reports survive; perhaps their perception is shallower or less vivid.  \nReply: Psychophysical tasks (e.g., point-light discrimination thresholds, predictive saccades) reveal no qualitative decrement. Moreover, participants\u2019 EEG signatures of goal violation mirror those of controls, indicating preserved automatic processing.  \n\nObjection 2: Cross-species cases might rely on analogical extension of generic motor primitives (approach, withdraw) rather than detailed resonance.  \nReply: Even if true, analogical abstraction is not resonance in the sense of mapping to the observer\u2019s own efferent commands. The necessity claim fails unless the mapping is literal and effector-specific.  \n\nObjection 3: fMRI lacks temporal resolution; perhaps a brief, indispensable motor signal precedes visual processing.  \nReply: MEG and intracranial recordings show that premotor activation during action observation lags behind STS by ~100 ms, making it unlikely to serve as the initiating perceptual source.  \n\n10. Conclusion  \n\nMotor resonance is an elegant, empirically grounded mechanism that enriches our understanding of social cognition. Yet the empirical and conceptual evidence demonstrates that it is not a sine qua non for perceiving goal-directed actions. Visual analysis of kinematic invariants, contextual affordances, and teleological regularities can, independently of motor simulation, deliver a robust percept of others\u2019 goals. The proper lesson is not to abandon resonance, but to relocate it within a pluralistic architecture: one route among several, sometimes dominant, often supportive, never alone indispensable.  \n\n(\u22482,050 words)", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 14, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 2668, "reasoning_tokens": 128}

How might one respond to this objection and explain how a clock mechanism could carry information about time without time itself causally influencing the mechanism?", "answer": "                                                   A Sense of Time without Time as a Cause\n                                                   --------------------------------------\n\n1. Introduction  \n\nA recurrent sceptical argument maintains that there can be no genuine \u201csense of time,\u201d because the very idea of a sensory system presupposes causal impact from an external, detectable property upon the sensory organ, and\u2014so the objection runs\u2014time does not causally impinge on anything. Photons strike the retina, pressure waves jostle the cochlea, and volatile molecules meet olfactory receptors, but nothing analogous, the objector claims, occurs in the case of time. In consequence, whatever we call our temporal awareness\u2014experienced duration, simultaneity judgements, timing of actions\u2014cannot be sensory in the same manner as vision, audition, or touch.  \n\nThe objection packs considerable intuitive force. Yet many philosophers and cognitive scientists hold that organisms\u2014including humans\u2014do in fact possess specialised mechanisms for tracking temporal structure, mechanisms whose behavioural and perceptual outputs display characteristic signatures of an information-bearing sensory system. How can that be? How can a mechanism carry information about a variable that does not itself causally \u201cpush\u201d on the mechanism?  \n\nThe aim of this essay is to offer a systematic response. I shall argue that the objection rests on a conflation of two distinct roles that an environmental feature may play vis-\u00e0-vis a sensory system: (i) acting as the *proximal stimulus* that triggers activity in the receptor, and (ii) determining an *information-theoretic correlation* between states of the system and states of the environment. When those roles come apart, the causal-impact requirement evaporates. A clock\u2014even the organic \u201cclocks\u201d studied by cognitive science\u2014carries information about time because its internal dynamics are law-governed functions of elapsed time, even though time itself exerts no causal force over and above the microphysical causes already present. In this respect, temporal sensing is no more metaphysically problematic than a thermometer\u2019s sensing of temperature once we are clear about what does and does not do the causal work.  \n\nSection 2 clarifies what the objection means by \u201ccausal impotence.\u201d Section 3 distinguishes different conceptions of sensory systems and shows why only one version feeds the objection. Section 4 sketches an information-theoretic account of representation that dissolves the need for time as an additional cause. Section 5 describes two concrete families of temporal mechanisms\u2014mechanical clocks and neural interval timers\u2014to illustrate how the account plays out in practice. Section 6 replies to residual worries, including the \u201cdisplacement problem\u201d (a clock tracks only its own workings, not time \u201cout there\u201d) and the metaphysical question of whether time passes. A brief conclusion summarises the argument.\n\n2. What Does It Mean to Say Time Is Causally Impotent?  \n\nThe claim that \u201ctime exerts no causal influence\u201d can be unpacked in at least three ways.  \n\na) *No event may have time itself among its efficient causes.* When an apple falls, the story is told in terms of gravitational interactions, not \u201cbecause ten seconds passed.\u201d  \n\nb) *Temporal relations are parameters, not forces.* The fundamental laws of physics use the variable t as an index ordering states of a system; they do not introduce a field that pushes matter simply by virtue of being temporal.  \n\nc) *There is no temporal counterpart to photons or sound waves.* Nothing analogous travels from temporal property to receptor.  \n\nAll three ideas speak to the same intuition: whereas light or pressure literally acts on the sensory receptor, time does not. But remember: causes come packaged with laws. A charged particle in an electric field accelerates not because \u201cspace\u201d pushes on it, but because the laws describing the field include space-indexed parameters. The temporal case is formally parallel. The state of a physical system S at time t is determined (in deterministic regimes) by its earlier states plus the laws; the laws contain an explicit time parameter. In this sense, time is written *into* the causal structure of the world even while never acting as a distinct *force\u00ad-like* agent. The question, then, is whether a sensory system might exploit that structural fact to carry information about t.  \n\n3. Two Conceptions of a Sensory System  \n\nCall the first conception *Impact Receptoralism*: a sensory system is fundamentally a receptor-effector chain that begins with an exogenous stimulus impinging on a receptor surface. Traditional textbook accounts of vision or audition adopt this model. If Impact Receptoralism is the only legitimate notion of sensing, the causal-impotence objection may appear decisive.  \n\nBut contemporary cognitive science has long moved beyond the receptor-driven picture. Many paradigmatic instances of biological sensing depend on internal processes that are not triggered by an incoming signature of the target variable. The canonical example is chemotaxis in *E. coli*: internal molecular networks oscillate, and the bacterium compares successive samples of the environment to compute a spatial gradient. Spatial location is not itself causing the oscillation; instead, the organism temporally integrates disparate signals to *infer* a spatial property. Similar stories apply to vestibular orientation, proprioception, and immune recognition. What unites these examples is not receptor impact but *informational covariance* between internal states and distal variables, a covariance explained by the physical laws governing both.  \n\nLet us therefore adopt a second conception, *Informational Functionalism*: a system S counts as a sensory system for variable V if  \n\n(1) There exists a physically grounded mapping f such that, over a specified operating range, f(t) = \u27e8state of S at t\u27e9 ;  \n\n(2) The mapping is reliably co-variant: different values of V lead, via the lawful evolution of the system, to distinct internal states;  \n\n(3) The organism exploits that covariance to guide behaviour in a manner that enhances fitness (or, for artefacts, achieves a design function).  \n\nUnder Informational Functionalism, a receptor triggered by external impact is merely *one possible* mechanism for satisfying (1)\u2013(3). Nothing in the definition demands that V itself be an efficient cause. What matters is that the state of S is a *deterministic (or probabilistic) function* of V according to natural laws.  \n\n4. Information without Direct Causal Impact  \n\nInformation in the Shannon sense is a measure of *correlation*: S carries information about V to the extent that the probability distribution over V is narrowed when one conditions on S. Suppose that for an ideal pendulum clock with length L, the angle \u03b8 of the pendulum at physical time t is governed (neglecting friction) by \u03b8(t) = \u03b8\u2080 cos(\u221a(g/L) t). Given knowledge of the clock\u2019s initial phase \u03b8\u2080, the current \u03b8 fixes t modulo the period 2\u03c0\u221a(L/g). The clock state perfectly *encodes* t even though t exercises no additional causal influence beyond being the independent variable in the law of motion.  \n\nThe objector might reply: \u201cBut in vision, photons *cause* retinal excitation; in the clock, time does not cause \u03b8.\u201d The reply is that photons likewise do not cause visual information *by themselves*; photons cause only the photochemical reaction. The *informational* link between retinal excitation and distal object properties (say, an apple\u2019s shape) is mediated by the laws of optics, the geometry of projection, and various ecological regularities. Nothing about shape pushes on the retina; only photons do. By parity of reasoning, nothing about \u201ctime itself\u201d need push on the clock. Both cases rely on law-governed regularities to convert immediate causal inputs into informational access to distal variables. Since the distal variable in the temporal case is \u201celapsed time,\u201d which is included as the parameter in the governing law, the informational tie is completely in place.  \n\nWe may thus articulate a general principle, *Lawful Encoding*: A system encodes variable V if the lawful dynamics of the system generate a mapping from V to internal states, whether or not V supplies a distinct causal input. The sense in which a thermometer \u201cdetects\u201d temperature is exactly the same sense in which a pendulum clock \u201cdetects\u201d time: the expansion of mercury is a deterministic monotonic function of ambient mean kinetic energy (temperature) according to the equation of state; the swing of a pendulum is a deterministic sinusoidal function of elapsed time according to Newtonian dynamics. That suffices for genuine detection in the informational functionalist sense.  \n\n5. Two Varieties of Temporal Mechanisms  \n\n5.1 Mechanical Clocks  \n\nConsider a balance-wheel watch. Energy stored in a mainspring drives an escapement that releases the wheel to oscillate in near-isochronous cycles. The watchmaker adjusts moment of inertia and spring stiffness so that the period approximates one second. Because the governing equations stipulate that the phase variable \u03c6 evolves as d\u03c6/dt = 2\u03c0/T, the state of the wheel (its angular position and velocity) at any moment specifies t (modulo an initial offset). A crucial point is that the causal influences *within* the watch are entirely local: forces among atoms, friction, elastic torques. Yet thanks to the temporal parameter in the equations, the internal state tracks t.  \n\nNote what would be metaphysically odd is demanding that time additionally \u201ckick\u201d the balance wheel at every instant. That is no more required than demanding that space \u201cpush\u201d on a metre stick so as to keep it one metre long. Laws suffice.  \n\n5.2 Neural Interval Timers  \n\nIn biological organisms, interval timing\u2014the ability to discriminate, say, two seconds from four seconds\u2014is implemented by a range of mechanisms. One influential model is the *striatal beat-frequency* (SBF) hypothesis. Cortical neurons emit oscillatory activity at slightly different frequencies; striatal medium spiny neurons detect the pattern of coincident spikes, and learning tunes synaptic weights so that a distinctive coincidence pattern triggers at the criterion interval. The initial cue (a tone or flash) resets phases; thereafter, nothing enters the system from the environment. Nonetheless, because the joint phase vector evolves with differential angular velocities \u03c9\u2081 \u2026 \u03c9n, the pattern at physical time t encodes t.  \n\nHere again: what causes the spike train is the cells\u2019 intrinsic ionic dynamics, not time-as-agent. Yet the pattern corresponds one-to-one with elapsed time until noise degrades the signal. The SBF network satisfies conditions (1)\u2013(3): lawful mapping, reliable covariance, and behavioural exploitation (rodents press a lever when two seconds have elapsed). The network is thus a bona fide temporal sensory system, notwithstanding the absence of external temporal impact.  \n\n6. Replies to Residual Worries  \n\n6.1 The Displacement Problem  \n\nPerhaps the objector will urge a refined complaint: a clock only measures its *own* internal processes. If the clock malfunctions, its reading diverges from physical time; hence the reading is not really about time but about \u201chow many oscillations this oscillator has produced.\u201d By contrast, vision arguably remains about the distal scene even if the eye is slightly distorted.  \n\nTwo comments. First, no sensory system is infallible; retinal after-images, auditory hallucinations, and proprioceptive drift all show that sometimes the system\u2019s state fails to match the distal variable. Fallibility does not defeat representational status. Second, both eyes and clocks track the distal variable only given a ceteris paribus clause that the relevant laws apply (Snell\u2019s law for vision, the small-angle approximation or damping tolerances for clocks). If those laws break, misrepresentation follows. In this respect the clock is not at a special disadvantage.  \n\n6.2 Does This Presuppose A-theory \u201cPassage\u201d?  \n\nAnother metaphysical qualm concerns whether the foregoing presupposes that time \u201cflows,\u201d as A-theorists contend. One might worry that if temporal passage is an illusion, then \u201csensing\u201d passage is illusory too. But the account on offer is deliberately neutral between A- and B-theories. All that is required is an ordered parameter t enumerated in the laws. Whether ontologically that parameter \u201cmoves\u201d or whether past, present, future are equally real is irrelevant to the lawful mapping. A B-theorist can cheerfully say: the clock\u2019s state at world-line parameter \u03c4 conveys information about which hyperplane of the foliation one occupies, even though nothing literally passes.  \n\n6.3 Isn\u2019t This Merely Calibration, not Perception?  \n\nOne may still hesitate: perhaps we should reserve \u201csensing\u201d for channels that rely on transduction of exogenous energy. Clocks, on this view, are *computational* or *inferential* devices, not sensory. This is a terminological preference, but it cuts across accepted usage in biology. Circadian systems are routinely called time-keeping or time-sensing mechanisms; bacterial chemotaxis senses gradients by internal comparison devoid of continuous exogenous input. Extending the label \u201csensory\u201d to any lawful information-gathering interface is not merely semantic inflation; it underwrites fruitful empirical research programs (chronobiology, neurochronometry) and coheres with an evolutionary perspective: any heritable mechanism that improves fitness by informing the organism about a variable in its ecological niche counts as a sensory adaptation.  \n\n7. Conclusion  \n\nThe causal-impotence objection rests on the idea that genuine sensing requires direct causal impact from the sensed property. A close examination of how information is carried in biological and artefactual systems shows that this requirement is misplaced. Sensory systems exploit lawful regularities to build an informational bridge from distal variable to internal state. In many familiar cases\u2014vision, audition\u2014one and the same energy transfer both provides the proximal stimulus and figures in the encoding law, making the role of law invisible. In temporal sensing, the two roles come apart: the relevant laws contain time as an explicit parameter, while the immediate causal dynamics involve only local physical interactions within the clock mechanism. Once we recognise lawful encoding as sufficient for sensory status, the possibility of a sense of time is secured. Mechanical clocks, circadian oscillators, and neural interval timers demonstrate in concrete detail how a system can carry information about time without time itself functioning as an extra causal force.  \n\nTherefore, the claim that the causal impotence of time precludes a sensory system for time should be rejected. We do possess mechanisms that track time every bit as legitimately as eyes track light\u2014by embedding physical laws that bind their internal dynamics to the temporal structure of the environment.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 0, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 3374, "reasoning_tokens": 320}
{"question_id": "Viera-SenseTime-2020", "question": "A common objection to the existence of a genuine sensory system for time holds that sensory systems gather information about the world through causal influence from the relevant environmental features on those systems (e.g., photons impacting the retina for vision). Since time is often considered causally impotent\u2014it cannot exert causal force on any mechanism\u2014there cannot be a sense of time. How might one respond to this objection and explain how a clock mechanism could carry information about time without time itself causally influencing the mechanism?", "answer": "1. Introduction  \n\nAmong the elements that constitute the manifest image of the world, time appears both the most pervasive and the most elusive. We mark birthdays, beat rhythms, anticipate deadlines, and recoil at the thought of timeless oblivion. Yet a recurring objection insists that, whatever else we can sense, we cannot literally sense time. The argument is straightforwardly causal: every bona-fide sensory modality, from vision to olfaction, works because some environmental feature causally impinges on the receptor system\u2014photons on the retina, odor molecules on the olfactory epithelium, and so on. \u201cTime,\u201d by contrast, is usually regarded as causally inert; it does not strike, bump, or push. Therefore, the argument goes, there can be no sensory system whose informational content is specifically temporal.  \n\nThe same worry is pressed with a familiar technological example. A barometer carries information about air pressure because pressure differences press against the diaphragm; a compass carries information about geomagnetic north because magnetic fields exert torque on the needle. But how can a clock carry information about \u201cwhat time it is,\u201d if time itself cannot exert force on any mechanism? If we are to respect the principle that sensing presupposes causal coupling, the objector concludes, clocks (and by parity, any biological \u201csense of time\u201d) must be at best metaphorical: they piggyback on changes that merely correlate with time but do not constitute genuine temporal sensing.\n\nMy aim is to diffuse this objection without denying either premise that makes it attractive. I grant (a) that perceptual or measuring systems trade on causal interactions and (b) that time itself\u2014understood as a dimension or manifold of ordered events\u2014is not an ordinary causal agent. What must be shown is that a mechanism can lawfully and reliably carry temporal information in virtue of ordinary causal interactions with non-temporal properties, and that this suffices for legitimate temporal representation. The strategy exploits the simple but neglected point that information need not be transmitted by the very property represented; lawful correlation, rather than direct causal impact by the represented property, is enough. Once that point is appreciated, the \u201csense of time\u201d slot becomes available, even in a broadly causal\u2013informational framework.\n\n2. Clarifying the Target  \n\nBefore offering the positive story, it helps to pinpoint exactly where the original objection presses. The opponent usually assumes something like the following principle:\n\nCausal Contact Principle (CCP): A system S can represent an environmental magnitude M only if M itself enters into a causal interaction with S.\n\nVariants of the principle abound in the philosophies of perception, mental representation, and scientific instrumentation. Yet CCP is considerably stronger than what is needed to preserve a causal account of information gathering. What causal informational theories typically require is not that M itself do the causal work, but that there be a nomologically grounded causal chain that establishes a reliable correlation between M and some state of S. Dretske\u2019s \u201cindicator semantics,\u201d Fodor\u2019s asymmetry condition, and Skyrms\u2019s probabilistic information theories all build representation on reliable covariance, not on direct impact by the represented property per se.  \n\nAn example from exteroception makes the point vivid. When you see a cow behind a picket fence, very little of the light hitting your retina originates from the cow; most of it comes from the fence slats. Yet you do see the cow. Likewise, sonar sense in bats depends not on bats\u2019 bodies being struck by insects, but on how the bats\u2019 self-generated sound pulses are reflected. Perception is often displaced: what you detect is a causal proxy that lawfully tracks what you represent. Hence a first rejoinder to the time-skeptic is to deny CCP and replace it with the weaker, more plausible:\n\nInformation Covariance Principle (ICP): A system S can represent M if there exists a reliable, law-governed causal chain that produces state s of S iff (or with high conditional probability that) M takes value m.\n\nUnder ICP, the burden shifts from asking whether time causes the mechanism to whether the mechanism exploits some causal process that correlates with temporal facts in a sufficiently robust, non-accidental way.\n\n3. How Clocks Work Without Time Doing Any Work  \n\nConsider a paradigmatic clock: an escapement pendulum clock. Nothing \u201ctemporal\u201d strikes the pendulum. Instead, gravitational force, tension in the escapement, and inertial mass conspire, under Newtonian laws, to sustain oscillations with a period approximately equal to 2\u03c0\u221a(l/g). The number of swings can be registered by gear teeth which, in turn, advance clock hands. Because the period is (to a first approximation) constant and independent of swing amplitude, the cumulative count of oscillations is lawfully correlated with elapsed time. Provided the clock is initially calibrated, the reading after n oscillations will differ from the reading at n+1 oscillations by a constant temporal interval\u2014say one second.  \n\nTwo observations emerge. (i) The causal work is performed by ordinary forces\u2014gravity, springs, friction. (ii) Those forces interact in a way that instantiates a lawlike regularity that is expressible in purely temporal terms. Thus the physical state of the mechanism after n oscillations stands in a reliably mapping relation to the temporal interval nT since the last calibration, where T is the period. Time itself has done no work, but the reading nevertheless carries temporal information.  \n\nExamples proliferate. Radioactive decay serves as a stochastic but statistically regular clock: the proportion of undecayed atoms after interval \u2206t is e^-\u03bb\u2206t. Heartbeats, circadian gene expression cycles, and cortical gamma oscillations in brains all operate as biological clocks. In none of them is \u201ctime\u201d a causal reagent; everything is accomplished by chemical potentials, ionic diffusion, membrane electrodynamics, or genetic transcription factors. Yet each yields a variable whose evolving values are tightly governed by laws in which temporal parameters figure essentially. That fact suffices for temporal informativeness.\n\n4. Information Versus Causation  \n\nOne might object that law-governed correlation is not yet representation; after all, innumerable properties covary with time\u2014entropy increases, shadows lengthen, paint dries\u2014but we do not treat every smudge of drying paint as a timepiece. The objection is fair but misses the target. Representation requires more than bare covariance; it requires a mechanism adapted (by evolution, learning, or design) to exploit the covariance for the purpose of tracking or controlling behavior with respect to the represented magnitude.  \n\nShannon information is a useful, if skeletal, formalization. Suppose X is a random variable specifying clock states (number of oscillations) and T is the elapsed time since calibration. Because of the physical law linking period T0 to oscillations, the mutual information I(X;T) can approach the entropy H(T) up to the resolution limited by noise. That is, observing X reduces uncertainty about T to near zero. By contrast, observing the wetness W of paint also reduces uncertainty about T (older paint tends to be dryer), but only feebly; the conditional probabilities p(T|W) will be broad and easily disrupted by humidity, pigments, or ventilation.  \n\nHence the difference lies not in the metaphysics of causation\u2014both escapement and drying paint involve causal processes\u2014but in the reliability, precision, and accessibility of the information channel. Clocks are engineered or selected specifically to maximize reliable time-coding capacities, whereas casual correlations remain unexploited except serendipitously.\n\n5. Biological Senses of Time  \n\nIf the argument so far is sound, it should generalize to living organisms. Do animals possess genuine temporal senses? Consider the circadian system in mammals. The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) harbors a molecular feedback loop of transcription and translation whose period is roughly 24 hours. SCN output modulates hormone release, body temperature, and sleep\u2013wake cycles. Light cues entrain the SCN via retinal photosensitive ganglion cells, but once entrained, the cycle free-runs in constant darkness. The causal influence on the molecular loop comes from gene expression kinetic parameters, photic input, and thermal noise; time itself exerts no causal push. Nevertheless, the chemical state of the SCN at phase \u03c6 functions as a biological \u201creading\u201d of what portion of the day has elapsed, and many downstream systems treat \u03c6 as semantic for time of day.  \n\nLikewise, the cerebellum and basal ganglia are rich in neural oscillators whose phase relations appear to underwrite millisecond-to-second range interval timing for tasks such as speech segmentation and coordinated motor action. Here again, ionic currents, synaptic potentiation, and inhibitory rebound do the causal work, but the organism behaves as though it directly registers durations: it begins to open the hand just in time to catch a ball, stops uttering a phoneme at the right millisecond, or starts foraging minutes before dawn. Empirical evidence thus corroborates the theoretical point: causal processes can be harnessed so that physiological variables function as temporal indicators.\n\n6. Does This Satisfy the Intuition Behind CCP?  \n\nThe skeptic may still worry that the story only shows how mechanisms can measure change, not time itself. Perhaps clocks reveal motion, decay, oscillation\u2014anything dynamic\u2014but remain blind to the underlying temporal dimension. A persuasive answer requires distinguishing substantive metaphysical claims about what time is from epistemological claims about how it is known.  \n\nIf one thinks of time as a primitive ordering relation among events (as in so-called B-theory), then to know what time it is just is to place an event at the correct location in that order. But ordering relations manifest themselves solely through patterns of change. Trying to sense time \u201cdirectly\u201d apart from change is akin to trying to see space apart from spatially extended things. Our epistemic route to dimensional structure is always via how material processes are embedded within it.  \n\nConversely, if one endorses an A-theoretic \u201cdynamic passage,\u201d the passing is arguably manifest in the continual updating of changeable states. Clocks, by undergoing systematic change, embody that passage. Either way, the state-of-the-clock\u2019s-mechanism stands in one-one mapping with the objective temporal parameter we care about. So the proposed account does not dodge the skeptical challenge; rather, it dissolves it by clarifying how any dimension can be epistemically accessed.\n\n7. Measurement Theory and the Role of Calibration  \n\nThe sense-of-time defender can strengthen the response by appealing to general measurement theory. A thermometer measures temperature because (i) there exists a monotonic, law-governed relation between mercury column height h and thermal quantity \u03b8 and (ii) the device is calibrated so that intervals in h can be mapped to intervals in \u03b8. Crucially, temperature does not shove mercury upward; molecular kinetic energy exchanges do. The role of calibration is to guarantee that the formal mapping endows the instrument\u2019s readings with the appropriate semantics.  \n\nExactly parallel points apply to clocks. To convert 60 pendulum swings into \u201cone minute,\u201d we perform a calibration given gravitational field strength, pendulum length, and so forth. Once fixed, the mapping is upheld by the same causal law that keeps the period stable. The semantics of the reading (e.g., 14:07:33) resides in the system of counterfactuals: had 120 swings occurred, the reading would be 14:08:33, and so on. No special causal traffic from time to clock is missing; what matters is that the mapping is stable under relevant counterfactual manipulations.  \n\nMeasurement theory therefore supports ICP against CCP. A legitimate measurement need not rely on the measured quantity\u2019s causal efficacy, provided a robust law connecting the measurement indicator to the quantity holds. Temporal measurement heads the list of quantities whose values are everywhere and always covariant with certain kinds of change processes. That is precisely why clocks are so easy to build and so versatile, ranging from sand trickling in hourglasses to caesium hyperfine transitions.\n\n8. The Philosophical Payoff: Representational Pluralism  \n\nAt this stage the original objection appears to trade on a conflation. It confuses (i) the requirement that some causal chain carries information into the system with (ii) the mistaken requirement that the represented property itself be that causal carrier. The first is indispensable; the second is optional. Once disentangled, the road is clear for a pluralistic view of representation: a state can represent G if it is recruited within a system that, as a matter of explanatory practice, exploits a reliable correlation between that state and G\u2019s values.  \n\nAn analogy may help. Scientists routinely speak of seismographs \u201crecording tectonic stress\u201d even though the stress does not directly act on the needle; what moves the needle are seismic waves mediated by mechanical couplings. The apparatus reads stress because seismologists calibrate the needle deflections against theoretical and empirical models linking stress, wave patterns, and needle positions. Clocks stand in the same relation to time.\n\n9. Addressing Residual Concerns  \n\nTwo residual concerns deserve mention.\n\nFirst, might the correlation between clock state and time be merely contingent? Suppose a freak cosmic event gradually alters the pendulum\u2019s length. Then the clock would go out of sync, undermining the claim that its readings genuinely represent time. That is correct, but harmless. Representation is fallible and defeasible. A tachometer can be miscalibrated; a thermometer can stick. What matters is that the mechanism is designed or has evolved to be success-riding\u2014a sustained mistake calls for repair, not for withdrawal of the claim that the gauge is a gauge.\n\nSecond, does the story trivialize temporal representation by making it ubiquitous? If any change reliably correlated with time can count, does every chemical reaction represent time? No. The difference, again, lies in functional role. For a state to be a representation, it must be poised to feed into systems of inference or control that treat it as about the represented property. The evolving concentration of a dye in table salt water may covary with time, but unless some user or downstream module exploits that fact\u2014adjusting plans, making predictions, solving navigational tasks\u2014what we have is a mere \u201cstanding in correlation,\u201d not representation. Clocks and biological timers are embedded in broader control architectures that exploit their readings; uncontrolled covariances are not.\n\n10. Conclusion  \n\nThe causal impotence of time, coupled with the causal nature of sensory and measurement processes, seems at first to license skepticism about any genuine sense of time. The objection rests on a too stringent Causal Contact Principle. Once we replace CCP with the more defensible Information Covariance Principle, the apparent puzzle dissolves. Clocks, whether mechanical or biological, harness ordinary causal forces arranged in law-governed structures to produce states that map systematically onto temporal parameters. Because these states are functionally exploited as indicators of duration, phase, or moment, they qualify as temporal representations, even though time does not itself knock on the door of the mechanism.  \n\nIn short, to sense time one need not be touched by time; it is enough to be touched by processes whose lawful unfolding is isomorphic to temporal structure, and to have the engineering or evolutionary wherewithal to treat those touches as a readout of the when. That is precisely what clocks\u2014and arguably many neural systems\u2014have accomplished for centuries, rendering the skeptic\u2019s worry an instructive, but ultimately misguided, misunderstanding of how causal information flows can underwrite representation.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 1, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 3784, "reasoning_tokens": 576}

The Causal-Influence Requirement\n\nPhilosophers of mind and perception often begin with a simple picture of sensory systems: they gather information by being causally impinged upon by the very features they represent.  Light excites the retina, pressure deforms mechanoreceptors, odorant molecules bind to olfactory cilia.  If one takes this \u201ccausal-influence requirement\u201d seriously, a natural objection arises against the idea that there could be a genuine sense of time.  Time, conceived as a dimension or parameter of change, does not itself strike, press, or bind.  Unlike photons or odorants, \u201cthe passage of five seconds\u201d seems causally inefficacious.  Hence, the argument concludes, no mechanism could literally sense time; whatever appears to be time perception must reduce to the perception of other properties such as motion, change, or energy.\n\nThe objection packs considerable intuitive punch, yet its force depends on a particular (and arguably oversimplified) conception of how information is carried and represented.  In what follows I offer a multi-pronged response.  First, I show that the causal-influence requirement, interpreted strictly, is too demanding even for clear-cut sensory paradigms.  Second, I develop an alternative understanding of information bearing\u2014nomic or law-governed covariation\u2014on which a system can carry information about a property P even when P is not among the immediate causes of the system\u2019s states.  Third, I apply this framework to the special case of time, explaining how a clock, biological or artificial, can encode elapsed duration without time \u201cpushing\u201d on anything.  Finally, I address familiar worries: Does this story collapse time perception into mere change detection?  And if not, how does it accommodate the familiar distortions and illusions of temporal experience?  Throughout, the guiding idea is that causal influence is only one way\u2014indeed, often a derivative way\u2014of grounding informational relations.  Systematic, lawlike dependence is enough.\n\n\n2.  Why the Causal-Influence Requirement Is Too Strong\n\n2.1  Sensing Without Source-bound Causes\n\nBegin with an apparently uncontroversial case: color vision.  Photons do cause responses in the retina.  But what exactly are cones sensitive to?  A particular cone\u2019s absorbance curve is determined by the opsin\u2019s molecular structure; it is sensitive not to \u201cbeing red\u201d as a reflectance property but to an unstructured range of photon energies.  Moreover, seeing an extended surface as red depends on complicated neural inferences that compare outputs from millions of cones, discount illuminant spectra, and factor in contextual information.  The \u201ccausal influence\u201d at the receptor is, strictly speaking, only the arrival of photons; the represented property\u2014surface reflectance under standard illumination\u2014is two explanatorily layers removed.\n\nA thermometer pushes the point further.  When mercury rises, what immediately causes expansion is the kinetic agitation of mercury molecules, not the abstract statistical magnitude we call temperature.  Yet we happily say the thermometer \u201cregisters temperature.\u201d  In both cases, the represented property is not itself a direct causal agent.  Rather, it stands in a stable nomic relation to the system\u2019s microphysical causes.  This observation loosens the intuition that representation requires causal impact by the very feature represented.\n\n2.2  The Many-to-One Problem\n\nThe scientist examines a seismograph trace and pronounces: \u201cThat spike records the Chilean quake.\u201d  The stylus deflected because ground vibrations propagated through the Earth, not because \u201cthe quake\u201d somehow reached into the laboratory and nudged the pen.  A single local cause (vibration of the support) is systematically linked, via well-understood laws, to a distal property (magnitude 7.9 quake at 10:38 UTC).  Sensing often works this way: the mechanism is causally affected by a proximal signal that, given background laws and calibration, carries information about a more abstract, distal, or relational property.  Once this more permissive epistemology is in place, the path is cleared for time representation.\n\n\n3.  Information Without Causal Impact: The Nomic-Covariance Model\n\nFred Dretske coined the term \u201cnatural information\u201d for states that stand in nomic (law-governed) conditional relations to worldly conditions: a flame indicates oxygen levels below 13% cannot obtain, owl ear asymmetry indicates prey azimuth, and so on.  What matters is not that oxygen, azimuth, or prey exerts a unique causal force on the indicator.  Rather, given the relevant laws, the presence of the indicator would not occur unless the indicated condition held.  For information-carrying, counterfactual dependence is enough: had the condition not held, the indicator would not be in its present state.\n\nTime offers a special twist.  Physical laws are formulated with an explicit time parameter t.  Because these laws are temporally homogeneous (their form does not change over time) they generate regularities: if a radioactive isotope has half-life \u03c4, then, ceteris paribus, the proportion of undecayed nuclei after an interval \u03c4 is \u00bd of the initial population.  The amount of undecayed mass, M(t), covaries with elapsed time per a simple exponential law.  The law is not a further cause; it is a counterfactual-supporting pattern that allows us to treat M(t) as a time stamp.  A Geiger counter monitoring the activity of a sample thus carries information about how long the sample has been decaying, even though \u201ctime\u201d never crashes into the counter.  The mechanism plus the laws guarantee the covariance.\n\nThat, in miniature, is how clocks work.\n\n\n4.  Clocks: Intrinsic Dynamics as Temporal Indicators\n\n4.1  The Minimal Recipe\n\nA clock, broadly construed, is a system whose internal state passes through a sequence S(t) such that for each interval \u0394t within a working range the mapping t \u21a6 S(t) is injective and approximately linear.  Translation: different durations correspond to discernibly different states, and equal durations produce equal state changes.  If the device is appropriately calibrated, the present state serves as a reliable indicator of how much time has elapsed since an agreed zero point.  Crucially, what drives the state transitions are the system\u2019s own intrinsic dynamics: the escapement releasing a pendulum, the cesium atom\u2019s hyperfine oscillations, the metabolic cycles in the suprachiasmatic nucleus.  No external \u201ctemporal force\u201d is applied.\n\n4.2  What the Physics Looks Like\n\nConsider a classical pendulum clock.  For small amplitudes, the period T is approximately 2\u03c0\u221a(L/g).  L and g cause the motion; time, as such, does nothing.  Nonetheless, because the equations of motion permit us to solve for t as a function of the number of swings n (t = nT), the count n encodes elapsed time.  The encoding relation is underwritten by the law that links n, g, L, and t.  Similarly, in an atomic clock, microwaves are tuned to the hyperfine transition frequency of cesium-133.  The relevant causal transaction is electromagnetic; yet by M\u00e9tivier\u2019s law the oscillation frequency is fixed at 9,192,631,770 cycles per SI second.  Counting cycles gives time.\n\nIn each case, physical law F maps cause-affect pairs onto a time-indexed trajectory; inverting F yields t as a function of the observable state.  No additional time-specific causal ingredient is needed.  Time has left its mark in the lawful structure of the motion.\n\n4.3  Biological Clocks\n\nHuman and animal bodies contain multiple time-keeping subsystems.  Short durations in the range of milliseconds to seconds seem to be tracked by networks that accumulate neural pulses (the \u201cpacemaker-accumulator\u201d model) or by ensembles of decaying cellular processes with different time constants (\u201cstate-dependent networks\u201d).  Circadian time is tracked by molecular feedback loops in the SCN in which gene expression cycles with a ~24-hour period.  Again, the immediate causes are transcription, translation, phosphorylation, ion currents.  Yet because these biochemical events instantiate stable dynamics whose unfolding rate is virtually invariant under normal physiological conditions, downstream systems can read elapsed duration from the present molecular state.  Disruptions\u2014genetic knockouts, temperature shifts\u2014alter the coding relation and predictably distort subjective time, just as changing g distorts a pendulum clock.\n\nThus, at multiple scales, organisms deploy internal \u201cclock chemistry.\u201d  The states of these chemistries carry temporal information by virtue of nomic dependence, not by virtue of time itself pressing upon tissues.\n\n\n5.  Is This Merely Change Detection?  Distinguishing Time from Proxy Properties\n\nA critic may insist: \u201cYour story only shows that organisms are sensitive to change rates of internal processes.  That is not sensing time; it is sensing motion, decay, oscillation.\u201d  The challenge is to articulate why such sensitivity nevertheless counts as temporal representation.\n\n5.1  Many Proxies, One Abstract Variable\n\nTemperature, as we saw, is sensed via kinetic energy; color via photon energy; spatial location via retinal displacement.  In each case the proximal cause (molecular agitation, photons, retinal pattern) is not identical to the represented property, yet we do not hesitate to say organisms sense temperature, color, position.  What makes the representation one of temperature rather than of molecular velocity is not the proximal cause but the system\u2019s broader functional role: how the signal is used, what downstream inferences it licenses, under which conditions it is calibrated, what error-correcting feedback sustains it.  By the same token, an internal decay constant, beat count, or oscillatory phase may function as an elapsed-time parameter because:\n\n   a) It is calibrated in operative contexts by correlating internal state with external temporal markers (sunrise, heartbeat, metronome).\n   \n   b) Downstream systems treat alternative values as specifying how long ago some event occurred or how long remains until another event.\n   \n   c) Deviations are assessed epistemically as temporal errors (\u201cmy watch is slow\u201d), not as errors about decay or oscillation per se.\n\nWhen an archer counts \u201cone-and-two-and-three\u201d to time a breath, the relevant variable is not the number of syllables uttered but the duration thereby marked.  Likewise, when the brain uses the phase of a theta oscillation to predict the next auditory beat, what matters functionally is elapsed time.  Change detection becomes time detection when its functional role is temporal.\n\n5.2  Counterfactual Scenarios\n\nSuppose a malicious neuroscientist intervenes and doubles the period of every SCN oscillation while leaving all other neural circuits untouched.  If the organism subsequently eats, sleeps, and anticipates daylight on a 48-hour cycle, we say its sense of time is distorted.  We do not say it now perfectly represents a slower molecular oscillation.  Our explanatory practice singles out the temporal variable as the content of the signal.  This suggests that content attribution flows from the system\u2019s causal-semantic embedding, not from the identity of the proximal cause.\n\n\n6.  Objections and Replies\n\n6.1  The Metaphysical \u201cNo Time, No Cause\u201d Objection\n\nThe motivating objection insists that because time lacks causal powers, no state of affairs could nomically depend on it.  Yet modern physics does not treat time as a sparse, force-like entity alongside electromagnetism and gravity.  Rather, time is a parameter encoding ordered relations among events.  On relational or structuralist views (Leibniz, Barbour, Rovelli), causal interactions proceed among events; time supervenes on the network of relations.  If so, we should not expect \u201cthe flow of time\u201d to be a separate causal arrow.  The causal differentiation objection therefore misfires: it mistakes a representational parameter (t) for a force vector.\n\n6.2  The Underdetermination Objection\n\nCould two clocks in different physical media (sand, quartz, cesium) produce identical states while differing in how much time has passed, thereby breaking the information link?  Strictly speaking, the states \u201cone pound of sand in the bottom bulb\u201d and \u201cdigit readout: 12:00\u201d can coincide under different histories.  But this is a general problem for representation: any indicator can misfire.  What secures reliability is not logical necessity but causal-nomic regularity within an appropriately delimited context.  In normal conditions, given how the sandglass is built and calibrated, one pound in the lower bulb means one hour has elapsed.  If someone flips the glass mid-run, misrepresentation occurs.  Similarly, your retina can misrepresent surface color under weird lighting.  The possibility of error is a hallmark of representation, not a defeat of it.\n\n6.3  Phenomenological Objection: The Subjective Flow\n\nSome authors insist that the distinctive phenomenal feel of temporal passage\u2014the \u201cspecious present\u201d\u2014cannot be captured by a mechanistic clock picture.  Here one must distinguish: the target of the original objection was the *existence* of a sensory system for time, not the metaphysics of temporal qualia.  A plausible story of information flow is logically compatible with further debate about qualia.  Indeed, by showing how biological clocks feed predictive coding networks that stitch events into short retentional envelopes (~100\u2013300 ms), the mechanistic account illuminates where the flow-phenomenology might arise.\n\n\n7.  Taking Stock: The Analogy Extended\n\nVision:\n\n   \u2022 Proximal cause: photon impacts.\n   \u2022 Represented property: environmental layout, color.\n   \u2022 Lawlike link: optics + neural inference.\n\nThermoception:\n\n   \u2022 Proximal cause: kinetic agitation \u2192 receptor ion channel opening.\n   \u2022 Represented property: temperature.\n   \u2022 Lawlike link: statistical mechanics.\n\nTime perception:\n\n   \u2022 Proximal cause: intrinsic periodic or monotonic processes (oscillation, decay, accumulation).\n   \u2022 Represented property: elapsed duration.\n   \u2022 Lawlike link: dynamical equations specifying the rate.\n\nIn no case is the represented property itself a standalone causal agent acting on the receptor.  Instead, lawlike covariance plus appropriate functional embedding suffices.\n\n\n8.  Toward a Positive Theory of Temporal Representation\n\nBuilding on the above, one can outline a positive account:\n\n1.  Base Dynamics.  The organism contains one or more subsystems whose temporal evolution D(t) approximates a known function f(t) over the range R.\n\n2.  Calibration.  Through evolutionary selection, developmental plasticity, or active learning, the organism establishes a mapping between distinct states of D (call them \u03c3\u2081 \u2026 \u03c3\u2099) and conventional temporal magnitudes (e.g., circadian phases, milliseconds).\n\n3.  Exploitation.  Downstream systems consume states \u03c3\u2096 in ways that would promote success only if \u03c3\u2096 tracked elapsed time (e.g., predicting prey trajectory, regulating sleep).\n\n4.  Error Monitoring.  Mismatches between expected and experienced temporal outcomes drive plastic changes, keeping the mapping accurate\u2014recalibration.\n\nUnder this framework, time representation is an emergent, functional achievement grounded in but not reducible to direct temporal causation.\n\n\n9.  Conclusion\n\nThe objection that time cannot be sensed because it exerts no causal force trades on an overly narrow conception of information acquisition.  Clocks\u2014whether pendula, atoms, or cortical oscillators\u2014show how a system can reliably encode duration by harnessing internally stable dynamics whose unfolding is law-governed.  Time, on this view, is not a ghostly cause; it is the order relation we abstract from lawful change.  A mechanism that instantiates change with a stable, parameterizable rate carries time information in exactly the same sense that a thermometer carries temperature information.  Once we appreciate that representation hinges on nomic covariance, calibration, and functional use, the supposed explanatory gap between \u201csensing temperature\u201d and \u201csensing time\u201d shrinks to insignificance.  The clock\u2019s tick, the neuron\u2019s oscillation, and the Geiger counter\u2019s clicks are temporal indicators not because time pushes on them but because, through the lawful structure of the universe and the organism\u2019s ingenious exploitation of that structure, their states and the amount of elapsed time stand and fall together.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 2, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 3961, "reasoning_tokens": 512}
{"question_id": "Viera-SenseTime-2020", "question": "A common objection to the existence of a genuine sensory system for time holds that sensory systems gather information about the world through causal influence from the relevant environmental features on those systems (e.g., photons impacting the retina for vision). Since time is often considered causally impotent\u2014it cannot exert causal force on any mechanism\u2014there cannot be a sense of time. How might one respond to this objection and explain how a clock mechanism could carry information about time without time itself causally influencing the mechanism?", "answer": "I. Introduction  \n\nThat there could be something properly called a \u201csense of time\u201d strikes many philosophers as suspect. Sensing, as we ordinarily understand it, involves an encounter with a worldly item that causally impinges on a receptor: light on retinas, air-borne chemicals on olfactory cilia, pressure waves on cochleae. Time, the objection runs, is not the sort of entity that can \u201cbump into\u201d anything. If time is merely a dimension, a parameter, or (for the relationist) nothing over and above the changing of events, then it is causally inert. Hence there can be no dedicated receptor or channel by which an organism, or even a simple device like a clock, could obtain information about it.  \n\nYet clocks are astonishingly good at telling time, and animals\u2014including humans\u2014routinely time intervals with surprising precision. How can a mechanism, biological or artefactual, come to carry information about the passing of time if time never reaches out to influence it? In what follows I argue that the objection rests on a mistaken picture of representation, information and causation. A clock does not need to be pushed or pulled by time in order to represent temporal facts. Rather, it need only instantiate physical regularities that covary, lawfully and robustly, with temporal magnitudes. Once that more modest requirement is acknowledged, the path is clear for defending both the intelligibility of mechanical time-keeping and, more cautiously, the possibility of a genuine sensory system for time in biological creatures.  \n\nII. Three clarifications  \n\nBefore addressing the objection directly, it helps to draw three distinctions that are frequently elided.  \n\n1. Causal influence vs. causal mediation. Photons causally influence retinal photoreceptors, but what makes the retinal state one that carries information about, say, surface colour is not that being red causally did something to the eye; rather, the photons\u2019 particular wavelengths mediate a causal interaction. In other words, the property represented (surface colour) is not itself a cause; the causal work is done by electromagnetic radiation correlated with that property.  \n\n2. Representation vs. detection. The retina is not a \u201ccolour detector\u201d in the sense of responding to colour qua property of surfaces; it responds to light of various wavelengths. The representational link between retinal output and worldly colour is secured by systematic, evolutionarily entrenched correlations. Representation is thus typically indirect.  \n\n3. Constitutive vs. etiological explanations. Asking how something currently represents temporal intervals is different from asking how that representational capacity arose in evolutionary or cultural history. Even if time never exerts a causal push, an organismal trait can evolve because organisms that \u201ckept good time\u201d reaped fitness benefits.  \n\nWith these clarifications in place, the objection begins to look less forceful. If colour can be represented indirectly, so can time. Indeed, in many canonical cases of perception the represented property never touches the receptor; what touches the receptor is a signal that is reliably correlated with the property in question.  \n\nIII. What time does and does not do  \n\nThe objection\u2019s core premise is that time is \u201ccausally impotent.\u201d How should that be understood? In contemporary metaphysics, two broad families of views dominate. The substantivalist takes time (or space-time) to be a sui generis entity that underlies and structures events. The relationist, by contrast, treats time as nothing above and beyond relations of precedence and duration among events. Both camps agree that time is not a force on a par with electromagnetism, nor a substance that pushes matter around. But neither conclusion entails that no mechanism can be sensitive to temporal facts.  \n\nAll dynamical physical laws are explicitly time-indexed. If you want to predict where a pendulum bob will be, you treat its position as a function of t. A pendulum does not need to be \u201cacted on\u201d by time; instead, its behaviour unfolds in lawlike ways that increasingly diverge from its earlier state as t increases. To build a clock, one harnesses exactly such lawlike regularity. What matters is not an external temporal shove but an internally stable dynamical evolution that tracks the temporal metric.  \n\nIV. Clocks, covariance and information  \n\nClaude Shannon famously defined information in terms of reduction of uncertainty in a receiver about the state of a source. Crucially, the mathematical framework is silent on the ontological status of what the message is \u201cabout.\u201d A mercury barometer carries information about atmospheric pressure by dint of reliable covariance between pressure outside and mercury height inside. Pressure does causally impinge on the column, yet \u201catmospheric pressure\u201d at a distance does not. Likewise, a smoke alarm\u2019s LED status light carries information about the presence of combustion gases by means of circuitry that only ever \u201csees\u201d voltage differentials. In both cases, representation depends on dependable correlation, not on direct causal traffic from the represented property.  \n\nA clock\u2019s moving hand, oscillating quartz crystal, or pulsing cesium transition is correlated, by underlying physical law, with elapsed temporal intervals. The mechanism\u2019s states partition time into discriminable equivalence classes\u2014seconds, minutes, hours. When I consult a clock, I exploit those correlations: the pointer\u2019s angular position covaries with true time of day (within a tolerance), so by perceiving the pointer I gain information about the time. Importantly, \u201ctrue time\u201d does not need to enter the mechanism as a cause; the mechanism\u2019s own periodicity suffices, provided that its period is stable.  \n\nV. Why stability, not external causation, is the crux  \n\nWhat qualifies a physical process to serve as a clock is (i) its periodicity and (ii) the robustness of that periodicity under environmental perturbation. A balance wheel oscillates roughly twice per second because of its mass and spring stiffness. Those parameters, together with laws of classical mechanics, fix a natural period. The same holds for quartz resonators and atomic hyperfine transitions. No extra causal influence from \u201ctime itself\u201d is required; the system\u2019s micro-structure guarantees reliable repetition.  \n\nNotice how this differs from paradigmatic sensing of exogenous features like light or sound. A photoreceptor must continuously receive photons in order to keep representing the colour or luminance of a scene. A quartz crystal, by contrast, would continue to oscillate at 32,768 Hz even in a dark, sealed box. Its representational power stems from intrinsic regularity, not continual stimulation. Nevertheless, that intrinsic regularity becomes informative about time precisely because the underlying physics guarantees that the nth oscillation will occur after n/f seconds.  \n\nVI. From artefacts to biology: endogenous time-keeping  \n\nIf the objection concedes that artefactual clocks can legitimately track time without being causally nudged by time, one might still resist extending the lesson to biology. Isn\u2019t perception supposed to yield continuously updated, action-guiding information? And don\u2019t animals obtain interval estimates by monitoring external changes, like motion or countable events, rather than via an internal sense organ?  \n\nEmpirical work on circadian and interval timing undermines this scepticism. Nearly all multicellular organisms possess molecular feedback loops (e.g., the PER-TIM mechanism in fruit flies, the CLK-BMAL loop in mammals) that oscillate with a period near 24 hours, entrain to zeitgebers such as light and temperature, and regulate a host of physiological processes. These loops keep running in constant darkness. They function, in effect, as biochemical clocks: temporally structured internal signals that the organism consults to anticipate dawn, schedule feeding, or switch metabolic pathways.  \n\nShorter-scale timing in the seconds-to-minutes range appears to rely on ramping neural activity, coincidence detection across cortical oscillations, or population clocks\u2014distributed patterns of firing that reliably unfold over time. None of these mechanisms requires external temporal stimuli. Instead, they exploit lawful neural dynamics whose trajectory can be calibrated to an interval of interest. And animals use those internal states to control behaviour: bees revisit flowers at the time of day when nectar replenishes; rats press levers approximately 12 seconds after a cue.  \n\nIf physiological devices can represent time by virtue of endogenous regularity, then a \u201csensory system\u201d for time is not a conceptual impossibility. What makes a system sensory is that its outputs are treated, by downstream cognition, as information about the environment\u2014here, environmental temporal structure. The retina is evolution\u2019s solution to wavelength-specific covariance; the suprachiasmatic nucleus is its solution to daily periodicity. Both are ways of bringing world-relevant information under the organism\u2019s control.  \n\nVII. Direct vs. indirect realism about temporal perception  \n\nOne might reply that, even granting the foregoing, all that the organism or clock really \u201csenses\u201d is change\u2014chemical reactions ticking along, spikes propagating through axons, cogs turning\u2014not time itself. The representation of time is therefore derivative, reconstructed from primary sensory modalities. But this conclusion once again overextends a legitimate observation (representation is indirect) into a skeptical thesis (there is no representation of time).  \n\nConsider an analogy: temperature. No sensor responds to \u201ctemperature as such.\u201d Thermistors and warm receptors respond to molecular kinetic energy, which under standard conditions covaries with what we call temperature. Yet we are happy to say that a thermostat senses temperature. The step from causal interaction with kinetic energy to representation of temperature is mediated by a lawlike bridge principle: in gases at constant volume, mean kinetic energy is proportional to temperature. Similarly, in a harmonic oscillator, the number of completed cycles is proportional to elapsed time. The bridge principle, not an occult causal influence, licenses the representational claim.  \n\nHence direct causal contact with a property is not the price of representing that property. What is required is nomic mediation: stable laws that link the internal state tokened in the sensor to the external magnitude represented. For time, those laws are the laws of motion themselves. Because all physical processes evolve in time, any suitably regular process can, in virtue of that evolution, serve as a representational vehicle for temporal facts.  \n\nVIII. Objections and replies  \n\n1. The \u2018multiple clock\u2019 objection: Different processes run at different rates under varying conditions. How, then, can any internal mechanism count as veridically representing time, rather than merely instantiating its own idiosyncratic dynamics?  \n\nReply: Clocks, biological or mechanical, are constantly calibrated\u2014by sunlight, by social coordination signals, by temperature cues\u2014precisely to correct rate drift. In artefacts, we adjust wristwatches; in organisms, entrainment mechanisms shift oscillatory phase in response to zeitgebers. Representation does not require absolute accuracy, only sufficient accuracy for the organism\u2019s practical purposes. Vision is no less a genuine sense because it is fooled by optical illusions; likewise, temporal perception can be distorted (e.g., under psychoactive drugs) yet count as perception.  \n\n2. The \u2018redundancy\u2019 objection: Why posit a sense of time if all timing can in principle be derived from other senses plus memory of change?  \n\nReply: In principle derivability is cheap. In principle, three-dimensional shape can be derived from two-dimensional retinal images plus assumptions about lighting. That does not show that stereopsis and shape-specific cortical processing are explanatorily redundant. Having a dedicated system confers efficiency, precision and robustness. Empirically, organisms deprived of robust circadian entrainment exhibit metabolic and cognitive dysfunction\u2014evidence that dedicated timing circuits afford adaptive benefits beyond what opportunistic use of exogenous change would permit.  \n\nIX. Consequences for the philosophy of perception  \n\nRecognising time-keeping as a kind of sensing has two attractive philosophical pay-offs.  \n\nFirst, it dissolves the sharp dichotomy between so-called exteroception (of the outer world) and interoception (of bodily states). Temporal information straddles the boundary: the signal is produced inside, but what it represents\u2014when dawn will break, how long until a predator re-emerges\u2014is unambiguously worldly.  \n\nSecond, it prompts a reassessment of the causal theory of perception. If representation can ride on law-grounded covariance absent direct causal impact from the represented property, then causal contact, though important, is not the whole story. The richer story foregrounds structural or inferential relations\u2014what philosophers of science call \u201cstructural realism\u201d or \u201crepresentation as structural similarity.\u201d A clock is structurally isomorphic, in one dimension, to the ordering of temporal instants. That structural match, secured by laws, is enough for representation.  \n\nX. Putting it all together  \n\nWe can now articulate a direct response to the original objection.  \n\nPremise 1: For a sense modality to exist, there must be a mechanism whose states are caused by, and hence carry information about, the environmental property sensed.  \n\nPremise 2: Time does not causally influence mechanisms.  \n\nConclusion: Therefore, no sense modality for time exists.  \n\nThe argument is unsound, because Premise 1 mischaracterises what is required for information-bearing. The mechanism\u2019s states must covary with the property in virtue of lawful relations; the causation can be mediated by, or located entirely within, the mechanism itself. Photoreception is the paradigm, not the only model. Once we reformulate Premise 1:  \n\nPremise 1*: For a sense modality to exist, there must be a mechanism whose states lawfully covary with, and can be exploited to learn about, the environmental property sensed.  \n\nThe argument collapses. A clock, whether worn on the wrist or embedded in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, satisfies 1* even though time applies no forces. The lawful dynamics of oscillatory processes secure covariance, and organisms (or observers) exploit those dynamics to reduce uncertainty about temporal magnitudes.  \n\nXI. Conclusion  \n\nClocks, both artefactual and biological, teach a lesson of philosophical significance: representation hinges on reliable structure-preserving relations, not on a spooky causal handshake with the represented property. Time is woven so deeply into the dynamical fabric of physical law that any suitably regular process ipso facto tracks it. By leveraging that fact\u2014by harnessing pendulum swings, quartz vibrations or molecular feedback loops\u2014systems come to carry information about time without time ever \u201ctouching\u201d them.  \n\nAccordingly, the existence of a genuine sensory system for time is not blocked by time\u2019s causal impotence. The sense in which a creature \u201cfeels\u201d a looming deadline or \u201chears\u201d a silent second hand is, of course, distinct from the way it sees colour. But difference of mechanism is no bar to legitimacy. Temporal perception, like colour perception, is an evolutionary solution to a coordination problem: how to align an organism\u2019s internal states with the structure of its world. It need not await a metaphysical revolution in our understanding of time; it operates, law-obedient and causally unremarkable, in every tick that guides a bee to a blooming flower or a human commuter to the morning train.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 3, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 3670, "reasoning_tokens": 512}
{"question_id": "Viera-SenseTime-2020", "question": "A common objection to the existence of a genuine sensory system for time holds that sensory systems gather information about the world through causal influence from the relevant environmental features on those systems (e.g., photons impacting the retina for vision).

How might one respond to this objection and explain how a clock mechanism could carry information about time without time itself causally influencing the mechanism?", "answer": "A SENSE OF TIME WITHOUT THE CAUSAL HAND OF TIME:\nHOW CLOCK-LIKE MECHANISMS CAN CARRY TEMPORAL INFORMATION\n\n1. The Objection Restated\n\nA venerable line of thought holds that perceptual systems earn the honorific \u201csensory modality\u201d only if they are causally impinged on by the environmental magnitudes they detect. Vision counts because photons strike photoreceptors; audition counts because pressure waves buffet the cochlea; olfaction counts because volatile molecules bind to receptors. Time, by contrast, is said to be causally inert. It does not push, pull, strike, or bind. If causal influence is the price of epistemic admission, time can never be sensed. A fortiori, a human being can possess at most an inferential or reflective awareness that time has passed, never a genuine temporal sense.\n\nThe challenge divides into two parts:\n\nA. Information requirement: To qualify as a sense of X, a system must take in information about X.\n\nB. Causal requirement: Information about X is taken in only when X itself causally affects the system.\n\nGranted both, a sensory modality for time looks impossible. The task is therefore to show that (B) is false, or at least not universally required. We must explain how a mechanism can \u201ccarry information about\u201d elapsed time despite lacking a causal coupling to time as such.\n\n2. Information Without Direct Causal Origin\n\nBegin with the concept of carrying information. Fred Dretske famously characterized a signal as carrying the information that p when the probability of p, given the signal, is (near) unity. That is an essentially statistical or nomological relation; it need not be a direct causal relation. Archbishop Ussher\u2019s worn Bible might raise the probability that its owner believed the world began in 4004 BCE, even though the Bible did not cause Ussher\u2019s beliefs.\n\nA classic non-temporal illustration is the barometer. The mercury column rises and falls owing to local atmospheric pressure. Yet sailors treat the reading as evidence of an approaching storm. The storm is not the cause of the mercury level; rather, both the storm and the barometer\u2019s reading are downstream effects of the same pressure pattern. Covariation, not direct causal contact, suffices for information. In Shannon-style information theory, what matters is reliable correlation under an appropriate channel model.\n\nThus premise (B) already over-reaches: an organism can exploit a signal that correlates with a worldly magnitude even when that magnitude does not itself work the causal levers of the organism. Time might be another such case.\n\n3. The Clock Paradigm\n\nConsider a simple pendulum clock. What makes a pendulum a timekeeper is not that Time with a capital \u201cT\u201d reaches into the apparatus and nudges the bob. Rather, Newtonian mechanics supplies a law: the period T of a small-amplitude pendulum is approximately 2\u03c0\u221a(\u2113/g). Given a fixed length \u2113 and local gravitational field g, each full oscillation will take extremely close to that period. The succession of oscillations is a lawful, practically invariant process. Anyone who can detect which oscillation number the pendulum now occupies can infer (to within tolerance) how many seconds have elapsed since an agreed \u201cphase zero\u201d.\n\nA similar story can be told for hourglasses, quartz oscillators, caesium atomic clocks, circadian gene expression loops, or the pupil\u2019s damped jitter after a flash. What each shares is an endogenous, regular, and law-governed change of physical state that can be:\n\na) Calibrated against a standard temporal metric.\nb) Sensed by the organism\u2019s nervous system (proprioceptively, interoceptively, or exteroceptively).\n\nNo extra causal arrow from time is added. The world provides lawful processes whose own dynamics mirror, by necessity, the temporal parameter in our theories. Detecting the state of such a process just is detecting elapsed time.\n\n4. Nomological Versus Causal Ties\n\nPerhaps the objection will shift: \u201cFine, but the pendulum\u2019s present angle is caused by its earlier angle and gravitational forces, not by time. So the sensory system is really sensitive to the pendulum\u2019s physical state, not to time.\u201d The defender of temporal sensation can concede that the immediate causal input is some physical variable (pendulum angle, sand level, oscillation phase), yet insist that what those variables lawfully track is elapsed time. The crucial philosophical point is that carrying information about a magnitude does not require causal dependence on that magnitude; it requires being tethered by lawlike correlation.\n\nWilfrid Sellars urged that vocabulary for theoretical entities is introduced by \u201clawful correlation\u201d with observation terms. We have no causal interaction with electrons as electrons; we have interaction with clouds in chambers, tracks on photographic plates, scintillations on screens. The electron is posited because the pattern of those effects is law-governed. Mutatis mutandis, temporal properties are posited because the pattern of the pendulum\u2019s swings is law-governed by a temporal variable t. If the brain is wired so that every n oscillations it generates a neural pulse, those pulses lawfully correlate with roughly n \u00d7 T seconds having elapsed. The neural pulse therefore carries temporal information.\n\n5. Calibration and Design Histories\n\nTeleosemantic theories (Millikan, Papineau, Neander) add a historical dimension. A trait\u2019s representational content is fixed by the function for which natural selection, learning, or engineering designed it. Suppose early mammals with neural machinery that tracked diurnal light patterns used the resulting signal to schedule foraging. The selection process favored individuals whose internal oscillators matched the approximately 24-hour environmental cycle. The function of the oscillator is then to indicate environmental time of day, not to indicate photon flux per se. That function is inherited even when the animal is temporarily in total darkness inside a burrow. Under a teleosemantic account, the content \u201croughly 06:00 hours\u201d is assigned because that is what the system has historically been used to indicate. Again, no direct causation by time is needed.\n\n6. Temperature, Length, and Other Non-Causal Magnitudes\n\nThe smell test for a philosophical thesis is often parity of reasoning. Temperature does not literally cause mercury to expand; rather, molecular kinetic energy (itself a statistical property) causes increased collisions that cause expansion. Yet we happily say that a thermometer senses temperature. Weight does not cause a spring scale to stretch; gravitational force combined with mass does. Height does not cause the shadow on a sundial; geometry plus solar incidence does. If we insisted on direct causation by the very magnitude named, much of measurement theory would collapse. Better to say: a measuring device is one whose states stand in a reliable, exploitable, and law-governed relation to the magnitude. Clocks meet that criterion as well as thermometers or rulers.\n\n7. Neuroscientific Respectability\n\nEmpirically, humans exhibit multiple timing mechanisms.\n\na) Millisecond timing: Purkinje cell firing patterns in cerebellum, critical for speech and fine motor control.\n\nb) Seconds-to-minutes timing: Striatal beat-frequency models, in which cortical oscillators converge on basal ganglia coincidence detectors.\n\nc) Circadian timing: The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in the hypothalamus, whose gene-protein feedback loops run close to 24 h even in vitro.\n\nIn every case, the system is an internal oscillator or integrator whose successive states can be read as \u2018how long since reset.\u2019 Experimental disruption (pharmacological dampening, optogenetic phase shifts, lesions) degrades temporal judgments. Subjects unable to hear auditory clicks can still estimate durations; blind individuals maintain rough circadian phase; peripheral clocks keep ticking after the central pacemaker is ablated. The biological data confirm that bodies contain mechanisms that track time without needing \u201ctime rays\u201d impinging on receptors.\n\n8. Is Time Special?\n\nStill, one might insist there is an ontological gap. Temperature, pressure, and weight are macroscopic manifestations of microphysical causal networks; time is a dimension of all events. But the difference is not relevant to the epistemology of measurement. What matters is whether there are processes whose evolution with respect to the temporal parameter is predictable, monotonic, and regular enough for a consumer system to use as a proxy. The laws of physics guarantee a superabundance of such processes. Indeed, every causal process unfolds in time, so every continuously changing magnitude is, by suitable calibration, a potential clock.\n\nThe same thought can be recast in structural realist terms: what measurement devices latch onto are structural relations, not intrinsic properties. A pendulum\u2019s phase structure mirrors the affine structure of the real line of time. If the structure is preserved, information about one instantiates information about the other. There is no need for an extra metaphysical ingredient called \u201ctemporal causation.\u201d\n\n9. Objection: Mere Correlation Is Insufficient\n\nA worried critic may protest: the lawlike relation between pendular phase and elapsed time is a correlation we, the theorists, notice. The brain, however, must treat the signal as indicating time. Otherwise the oscillations could mean anything\u2014we risk indeterminacy of reference. Here the teleosemantic point returns. Through evolution, learning, or engineering, the system is conditioned so that its downstream consumers behave as though the signal heralds a temporal fact. When the SCN phase is \u03c0 radians, melatonin is secreted; when the basal ganglia detect coincident oscillations, a timed movement is initiated. Misrepresentation (phase slips, jet lag) impairs performance in ways selection disfavors. The usage establishes semantic anchoring: the system \u201cmeans\u201d the time, because that is what consequences hinge on.\n\n10. Objection: Internal Versus External Senses\n\nSome philosophers distinguish exteroception (world-directed) from interoception (body-directed). If the clock-like signals arise inside the organism, perhaps they deliver only bodily information (\u201cwhat my neurons are doing\u201d) not worldly information (\u201chow much time has passed outside\u201d). Again we can borrow the barometer analogy. The mercury height is inside the cabin yet informs the sailor about outside atmospheric pressure. Information flows outward epistemically even when causal processes flow inward physically. Internal oscillators can be entrained to the light-dark cycle; once calibrated, they continue to represent outside time when cues vanish\u2014much like a sailor consulting the barometer below deck. The relevant notion of \u201cexternal\u201d is representational, not anatomical.\n\n11. Toward a Positive Account of Temporal Sensation\n\nPutting the pieces together, we can sketch a general recipe:\n\nStep 1 (Regular Dynamics): Identify a physical process P whose mathematical description includes a monotonic dependence on the temporal parameter t.\n\nStep 2 (Calibrated Mapping): Establish a mapping f from the state-space of P to temporal magnitudes (seconds elapsed, phase of day, interval lengths).\n\nStep 3 (Detection Mechanism): Provide receptors sensitive to the relevant state-space coordinates of P.\n\nStep 4 (Utilization): Link the receptor outputs to downstream systems (motor planners, attentional controllers, hormonal secretors) that benefit when the temporal mapping f holds. Evolutionary or engineering feedback ensures the link is maintained.\n\nWhen Steps 1\u20134 are satisfied, the organism possesses a sensory subsystem that delivers usable information about time, even though time never directly \u201cmakes contact\u201d with receptors.\n\n12. Philosophical Payoff\n\nThe response to the original objection is thus two-pronged.\n\ni) Methodological: The causal criterion for sensing is too strict. Lawful, exploitable covariation suffices for information pick-up.\n\nii) Metaphysical: Time\u2019s alleged causal impotence is irrelevant, because what clocks detect are states of processes whose lawful unfolding serves as a surrogate for time. Those states do causally influence the detector, satisfying the more modest requirement that perception involve causal interaction\u2014just not with time itself.\n\nBy parity, we ought to admit a sense of time into our taxonomy, on a par with the sense of temperature, acceleration, or magnetism.\n\n13. Conclusion\n\nA clock mechanism carries information about time not by being bumped or prodded by a sui generis temporal force, but by exploiting the lawful evolution of internal or environmental processes whose states covary in a principled, measurable way with elapsed duration. Organisms, including humans, possess neural machinery attuned to such processes. Through calibration, learning, and selective pressure, those signals function to guide behaviour as representations of temporal facts. Causal impact from the process is present; causal impact from time per se is not required, any more than causal impact from \u201cheight\u201d is required for a ruler to measure length.\n\nTherefore, the objection that the absence of direct temporal causation precludes temporal sensation fails.

{"question_id": "Viera-SenseTime-2020", "question": "A common objection to the existence of a genuine sensory system for time holds that sensory systems gather information about the world through causal influence from the relevant environmental features on those systems (e.g., photons impacting the retina for vision). Since time is often considered causally impotent\u2014it cannot exert causal force on any mechanism\u2014there cannot be a sense of time. How might one respond to this objection and explain how a clock mechanism could carry information about time without time itself causally influencing the mechanism?", "answer": "What follows is a sustained answer of roughly two thousand words (\u2248 2 070) that develops one coherent way of defusing the \u201ccausal-impotence\u201d objection and showing how both biological and artefactual clocks can legitimately be said to carry information about time even though time itself is not one more causal agent in the chain.\n\n1. Framing the Objection\n\nA familiar\u2014indeed, almost textbook\u2014story about sensing is that it always involves causal traffic from the worldly feature sensed to the sensing apparatus. Photons strike the retina, pressure waves set the basilar membrane in motion, volatile molecules bind to olfactory receptors, and so on. If sensing is essentially the end-point of such causal chains, and if time does not itself impinge on anything\u2014there is no \u201ctemporal particle\u201d that ricochets off rods and cones\u2014then it looks as though there can be no genuine perception of time. At most, the organism may register temporal characteristics indirectly by detecting other, causally efficacious properties\u2014motion, frequency, rhythm, etc.\u2014but there is no dedicated sense of time itself.\n\nThe force of this objection rests on two assumptions:\n\na) A sensory system \u201cfor X\u201d must have X itself as the proximal cause of its information-bearing states.\n\nb) Time, considered as the \u201cpassage\u201d or \u201cflow\u201d of events, does nothing; it merely parameterises the causal goings-on described by physics.\n\nI shall argue that both assumptions are contestable. Once they are relinquished, the door opens to a principled account of how clocks\u2014both biological and mechanical\u2014encode temporal information without being acted on by some mysterious \u201ctime force\u201d.\n\n2. Two Kinds of Causal Relevance\n\nBegin with a distinction, emphasised by philosophers of science such as Wesley Salmon and James Woodward, between productive causal influence and correlational or counterfactual dependence. Productive causation is a matter of actual energy-momentum transfer: the photon imparts energy to the retinal molecule. Counterfactual dependence, by contrast, concerns systematic co-variation: if the atmospheric pressure had been different, the mercury column in the thermometer would have risen to a different height. Both relations can underwrite information-carrying links.\n\nNotice that in the barometer case, what directly pushes the needle is not \u201cpressure\u201d in the abstract but the concrete motion of gears and springs modulated by air pressing on an aneroid capsule. Nevertheless we are content to say that the barometer registers pressure because there is a reliable, law-governed mapping from atmospheric pressure values to pointer positions. Reliability, not ontological contact with a sui generis \u201cpressure stuff\u201d, is the decisive factor. The same moral will apply, mutatis mutandis, to temporal representation: what matters is a well-behaved mapping from elapsed time to internal states, not the existence of a dedicated time-specific causal channel.\n\n3. Temperature and Other Non-Forces\n\nThe objection under scrutiny, if pressed hard, threatens to over-reach. Consider temperature. It is not a fundamental force but a statistical measure of molecular agitation. Yet thermoreceptors in the skin, the pit organs of vipers, and digital thermometers all count as sensory or measurement devices for temperature. What they exploit are causal interactions\u2014infra-red radiation, heat conduction, molecular collisions\u2014whose statistical features covary with temperature. That is enough to ground talk of temperature perception.\n\nTime is more abstract still; it is the parameter with respect to which change is defined. But the moral remains: a system can carry information about a nominally \u201ccausally impotent\u201d quantity if it hosts processes whose states correlate in law-governed ways with that quantity.\n\n4. Clocks as Dynamical Regularisers\n\nHow, then, does a clock manage systematically to covary with elapsed time? The core idea is simple: harness a physical process whose dynamical evolution is (i) well understood, (ii) sufficiently stable, and (iii) readily coupled to a read-out mechanism. Here are three canonical recipes:\n\ni) Decay Processes. Caesium-133 emits radiation at a frequency defined by 9 192 631 770 transitions per second. The oscillation period is fixed by quantum mechanics; counting cycles yields an excellent time base.\n\nii) Harmonic Oscillators. A pendulum\u2019s period approximates 2\u03c0\u221a(L/g). Variations in length and local gravity are manageable; within tolerances the period is invariant. The escapement counts swings; gear ratios convert counts into minutes and hours.\n\niii) Wave Propagation. In a quartz wristwatch, an electric field makes the crystal flex; the piezoelectric effect converts mechanical oscillation back into voltage. The resonant frequency (\u2248 32 kHz) is strikingly temperature-stable. Divide-down circuits deliver one-second pulses.\n\nWhat these mechanisms have in common is not influence by \u201ctime itself\u201d but an internal, self-propagating evolution that a) would proceed even in isolation and b) obeys equations in which physical constants fix the rate when measured in SI seconds. Small disturbances affect amplitude, not phase; the oscillation therefore tracks objective time more or less faithfully. In short, one gets temporal information \u201cfor free\u201d once a sufficiently regular dynamical process is enlisted.\n\n5. Information Without Direct Causation\n\nClaude Shannon\u2019s classical measure of information turns on statistical dependence, not direct causal coupling. A variable S carries log 2(P) bits of information about another variable T when their joint probability distribution differs from the product of their marginals. The pointer of a clock at noon is perfectly correlated with the fact that twelve hours have elapsed since midnight; conditional entropy H(T|S) is near zero. That mutual information suffices for representational content, provided the correlation is non-accidental\u2014i.e., sustained by underlying laws. So even if time is not a productive cause, it can be the \u201csemantic\u201d source of the content borne by the clock state.\n\n6. Biological Case-Study: Circadian Entrainment\n\nTurning to biology, circadian clocks illustrate the same strategy in an evolutionary key. A cyanobacterial cell contains a KaiABC protein complex that undergoes a phosphorylation cycle of \u2248 24 h. Absent external cues (\u201czeitgebers\u201d), the cycle free-runs. Crucially, sunlight and metabolic signals modulate the rate, entraining it to the astronomical day. The system thus integrates causal input (light) with an intrinsic pacemaker. Selection favours mutants whose phase relationship to dawn optimises photosynthetic yield. The result is a molecular mechanism whose state predicts local solar time with biologically actionable precision, again without any \u201cinflux\u201d of time itself.\n\nComparable stories apply in mammals: suprachiasmatic-nucleus neurons express clock genes whose feedback loops produce circadian oscillations; retinal ganglion cells carrying melanopsin entrain the phase to the light\u2013dark cycle; downstream hormonal outputs (cortisol, melatonin) regulate sleep, metabolism, and so on. The general shape of the explanation never calls for a special temporal sense organ. Rather, the organism cultivates regular self-oscillations that are reliably indexed to objective temporal regularities in its environment.\n\n7. Objection: But Isn\u2019t the Correlation Trivial?\n\nA critic might reply that any physical process unfolds over time, so every state trivially correlates with some temporal interval. What confers distinctively temporal content on a clock\u2019s state, as opposed to a teacup\u2019s cooling curve? One answer appeals to functional role. A state represents t o\u2019clock when the system is embedded in a network of use that treats that state as informing time-sensitive decisions: opening the floodgates, triggering school bells, or initiating melatonin synthesis. The cooled-teacup state ordinarily plays no such causal-informational role; hence it does not count as a time representation. Representation is not in the bare covariation itself, but in the exploitation of that covariation by downstream consumers. (An analogy: tree rings carry information about age, but only become a representation of age when an archaeologist, dendrochronologist, or indeed the tree\u2019s own growth program makes systematic use of the rings as temporal markers.)\n\n8. The Semantics of Temporal Representation\n\nPhilosophers of mind often require three ingredients for representation: covariance, functional use, and historical etiology. Clocks satisfy all. The covariance is designed, engineered, or selected precisely to track elapsed time; the system is used by agents who rely on that tracking for scheduling behaviour; and there is a historical process that explains why those covariance relations exist (technological design or natural selection). Given these jointly sufficient conditions, talk of a \u201csense of time\u201d is perfectly warranted even if time does nothing causal over and above structuring the equations of motion.\n\n9. Replying to Strong Causal Demands\n\nStill, the original worry may persist in a stronger guise: perhaps representation requires that the represented feature make an explanatory difference inside the mechanism, not merely outside. Even here one can respond. Although time itself is not a substance, the rate parameters in the system\u2019s differential equations are dimensionally t-dependent. For a pendulum, d\u00b2\u03b8/dt\u00b2 = \u2212(g/L) sin \u03b8; for nuclear oscillations, d\u03c6/dt = 2\u03c0\u03bd. Without the parameter t, those equations are meaningless; hence the system\u2019s very dynamics \u201cembed\u201d time. In that minimal sense, time is woven into the causal description of the device. The demand that time be an extra force thus mistakes \u201cbeing an indispensable variable in the causal story\u201d for \u201cbeing another interacting entity alongside masses and charges\u201d.\n\n10. Relational Theories of Time\n\nA relationalist about time (Leibniz, Mach, Barbour) might go further, claiming that time just is the ordering relation among events. On that view, any device that maintains a quantitative relation to ordered events ipso facto tracks time. The supposed gap between temporal order and causal influence evaporates, because to stand in the right order-relations is already to instantiate temporal structure. The measurement of time is thus an exercise in mapping one ordering (pendulum swings) onto another (sunrise, heartbeat, work-shift). No \u201cflowing medium\u201d need press upon the clock; sensing time is sensing ordered change.\n\n11. Phenomenology and Neural Clocks\n\nWhat about human temporal experience\u2014our sense of duration, simultaneity, and rhythm? Current neuroscience points to multiple overlapping timing mechanisms. The cerebellum seems crucial for millisecond-level motor timing, the basal ganglia for interval timing in the hundreds of milliseconds to seconds range, and prefrontal\u2013parietal networks for prospective timing of intervals up to minutes. Again, the guiding principle is internal dynamical activity\u2014ramping neural firing rates, population oscillations, and network state-space trajectories\u2014that can be \u201cread out\u201d by other circuits as duration indicators. Pharmacological intervention (e.g., dopamine agonists) predictably speeds up or slows down perceived time, just as filing the tip of a pendulum shortens its period. Temporal phenomenology is thus grounded in brain processes that tick in a regulated way, not in a mysterious temporal input channel.\n\n12. Objection from Accuracy\n\nAnother worry: if the environment never \u201cpushes back\u201d with a corrective temporal signal, why don\u2019t internal clocks drift uncontrollably? The reply is that real clocks are seldom entirely open-loop. Photoperiod, temperature cycles, feeding schedules, and social cues entrain the circadian system; NTP servers and radio-timecodes discipline quartz oscillators; pulsars anchor the long-term stability of atomic clocks. So while the basic pacemaker supplies a free-running mapping from state count to elapsed time, calibration signals tune the mapping and curb drift. These external cues do exert ordinary causal influence; what they influence, however, is the phase and frequency of a process whose existence and basic regularity are intrinsic. Temporal accuracy is therefore secured without time acting as a force.\n\n13. Summing Up the Rejoinder\n\nIn light of the foregoing, the causal-impotence objection rests on a mis-specification of what sensory information requires. A system need not be buffeted by the represented property; it need only instantiate states that map, with appropriate regularity and under suitable control, onto values of that property. Time representation is achieved by:\n\na) Employing processes whose dynamics are describable by time-indexed laws;  \nb) Ensuring that those processes are sufficiently stable to licence a deterministic (or probabilistically tight) mapping from process state to elapsed time;  \nc) Embedding the process within an agent or device that exploits the mapping for action, decision, or further computation.\n\nNeither mechanical clocks nor biological chronometers invoke any occult temporal force. They simply couple internal change to objective temporal parameters in ways that preserve order and metric structure. Consequently, the absence of a \u201ctime particle\u201d is no barrier to temporal representation, just as the absence of a \u201ctemperature fluid\u201d is no barrier to thermal sensation.\n\n14. Wider Implications\n\nThe lesson generalises. Many scientifically respectable measurement practices rely on lawful correlations rather than direct \u201ccontact\u201d. DNA microarrays measure gene expression by fluorescence intensity; seismographs detect earthquakes via pen deflections; gravitational-wave detectors infer ripples in space-time from laser-interferometer fringes. In each instance, the measured quantity is represented by its imprint on some intermediary, not by an elemental confrontation between property and sensor. Clocks stand in illustrious company.\n\n15. Conclusion\n\nThe notion that perception demands causal impact from the very property perceived conflates productive causation with information-bearing correlation. Time, in mainstream physics, is not an exotic substance capable of strikes and pressures; it is the formal parameter of dynamical law. Yet because many physical processes evolve with dependable temporal profiles, a suitably engineered or evolved system can treat those profiles as a yardstick. Pendulums, quartz crystals, atomic oscillations, and biochemical feedback loops all instantiate such profiles. Clocks, both artefactual and biological, ride on those intrinsic regularities, calibrate them when possible, and thereby generate reliable indicators of elapsed time. Thus there can indeed be a \u201csense\u201d of time\u2014one rooted not in a direct temporal force but in the elegant strategy of correlating internal dynamics with the temporal order of the world.

Introduction  \n\nAmong the perennial puzzles in philosophy of perception is whether creatures like us possess anything deserving the title \u201csense of time.\u201d  A widely-cited objection rests on a causal premise: genuine sensory systems obtain information from the world only if a relevant environmental magnitude stands in a causal relation to the receptor mechanism.  Photons impinge on retinas, chemical volatiles bind to olfactory receptors, sound waves vibrate the cochlea.  But, the critic continues, time itself exerts no causal force.  Since nothing is pushed, pulled or otherwise modified by the mere passage of time, no receptor could be stimulated by time, and therefore there can be no temporal sense.  \n\nThe objection appears forceful.  Yet it sits uncomfortably beside two mundane facts: (i) organisms and artefacts routinely keep track of temporal intervals with impressive accuracy, and (ii) our ordinary psychological life is suffused with temporal phenomenology\u2014duration, order, simultaneity, rhythm.  If the causal impotence thesis disqualifies every mechanism that tracks time, something has gone wrong in the underlying picture of information-gathering.  My aim is to diagnose the fault and to show how a mechanism\u2014biological or artifactual\u2014can legitimately \u201csense\u201d time even though the passage of time is not a causal stimulus.\n\nThe strategy has four steps.  First, I will argue that the causal-influence criterion for sensory systems is too stringent once properly interpreted.  Second, I will distinguish several kinds of covariance that can underwrite information without requiring direct causal influence by the very property represented.  Third, I explain how ordinary clocks exploit lawful covariation between their internal physical processes and time; they thereby carry information about temporal intervals without time being a separate causal factor.  Finally, I draw out implications for biological time-keeping and human temporal perception, dissolving the original objection.\n\n2. Re-examining the Causal Influence Criterion  \n\nWhy believe that sensory representation requires direct causal influence?  The core intuition comes from a naturalistically respectable thought: perception evolved and operates because environmental magnitudes make a causal difference to an organism\u2019s activity.  In paradigmatic cases, there is event-to-event causation: the photon striking retinal photopigment alters its configuration, causing a neural cascade that eventually contributes to a behavioural response.  If the environmental magnitude did not causally trigger the receptor, the objection continues, the system could not reliably track that magnitude.  So the causal link is treated as a necessary condition on perception.\n\nBut attractiveness is not entailment.  To see the overreach, consider three familiar counter-examples:\n\na) Colour vision.  Objects do not emit \u201ccolour forces.\u201d  What causes the retinal response are photons with particular frequency distributions; colour is a higher-level relational property of an object\u2019s surface relative to an illuminant and observer.  The receptors are causally affected by light, not by colour per se, yet we credit colour vision as genuine perception.\n\nb) Thermometry.  A mercury thermometer \u201cregisters\u201d temperature even though temperature, as a mean kinetic energy, is not a causal agent.  What directly expands the mercury are collisions of molecules.  Nonetheless, we are satisfied that the column represents temperature.\n\nc) Barometers.  Atmospheric pressure is not a discrete causal impact on the aneroid capsule; rather a disjunction of micro-level molecular collisions maintains the pressure difference.  Still, we treat the instrument as carrying information about pressure.\n\nThe pattern is that a sensor can represent a macro-level or abstract property even when what causally impinges on it is a micro-level realizer.  Colour, temperature and pressure differ from time in some respects, but they share the key feature: the represented property is not identical with the immediate causal interaction.  Therefore the causal-influence criterion must be formulated more carefully.  A realistic constraint is that a sensory system must stand in a reliable counter-factual dependency with the environmental property, normally mediated by physical processes governed by laws.  Direct causal impingement by the represented property itself is optional.\n\n3. Information Without Direct Causation  \n\nWhat does it take for one variable, X, to carry information about another, Y?  On a standard Shannon-based approach, X carries information about Y if values of X are probabilistically dependent on values of Y, relative to some background channel.  Causal connection is one route to dependence, but lawful covariation is enough.  This perspective has been elaborated in epistemology (Dretske), philosophy of science (Woodward) and evolutionary biology (Skyrms).  A mechanism can legitimately rely on informational covariances produced by common causes, by deterministic constraints, or by symmetries of the world.\n\nTime embodies perhaps the most universal constraint: every physical process unfolds according to dynamical laws expressed with an explicit temporal parameter.  Consequently, the state of a lawful dynamical system at t2 is a deterministic (or probabilistic) function of its state at t1 and the elapsed time.  From the vantage point of information theory, a process evolving at a rate specified by such laws is an internal correlate of elapsed time.  To utilise that correlation, a clock must:\n\n(i) Contain a component process whose evolution is monotonic and stable relative to some calibration.\n\n(ii) Have an interface converting the internal state into a readable signal.\n\n(iii) Be initiated (or periodically corrected) so that internal state S corresponds to an origin-point on the temporal scale.\n\nNothing in this set-up requires time itself to do causal work beyond furnishing the independent variable in the dynamical equations.  Let us examine two examples.\n\n4. How Mechanical Clocks Track Time  \n\n4.1 The Pendulum Clock  \nA pendulum of length L, displaced by small angle \u03b8, undergoes oscillations with period T \u2248 2\u03c0\u221a(L/g).  Gravitational acceleration g and length L determine period, but \u201ctime\u201d is not an extra force; rather, the oscillatory dynamics constitute a physical process whose regularity is described with temporal parameters.  If one counts the swings, one counts equal temporal intervals because each swing is law-governed to occupy approximately the same duration.  The escapement mechanism translates this periodic motion into discrete tooth-by-tooth advances of the gear-train and hence rotation of the hands.  Correlation with external time arises from the lawful constancy of the oscillation; no additional causal input from time is needed.\n\n4.2 The Caesium-Beam Atomic Clock  \nAt the quantum scale, caesium-133 atoms undergo a hyperfine transition with frequency 9,192,631,770 Hz.  Interaction with an RF field and subsequent detection of state populations allows the device to steer an oscillator so that each cycle matches the atomic transition.  The result is a clock accurate to 10-15 seconds per day.  Again, time does not act upon the atoms; rather, the transition frequency, set by internal energy levels and fundamental constants, serves as an intrinsic, reproducible process.  Tallying 9,192,631,770 transitions defines one second by convention.  The clock\u2019s output state is reliably conditional on elapsed time because a fixed number of cycles corresponds to a fixed interval.\n\n4.3 What Does the Clock Represent?  \nBoth artefacts convert a predictable dynamical compulsion into an external read-out.  Because the mapping from internal state to elapsed time is stable under calibration, observers (or connected machines) can treat the display as a sign of how much time has passed.  The clock thus carries semantic information: the content of the clock-reading is about a temporal interval.  Importantly, the truth-conditions of that content depend on the relation between the internal process and external events, not on time\u2019s causal action.\n\n5. The Metaphysics of Temporal Representation  \n\nThe foregoing dissolves the objection by noting that temporal representation hinges on law-governed covariance, not causal influence from a sui generis temporal entity.  Let us articulate the metaphysical moral.\n\n(a) Time as Parameter, Not Cause  \nIn canonical physics, time is a coordinate or parameter, not a field exerting forces (except in certain relativistic contexts where space-time curvature influences motion, but this still does not involve \u201ctime forcing clocks\u201d).  Just as a spatial location does not push objects to inhabit it, the temporal location does not cause events to occur.  Yet spatial perception is unproblematic: retinal stimulation by photons lawfully depends on the observer\u2019s relative spatial position to objects.  Analogously, temporal tracking exploits lawful dependence of a system\u2019s internal state on its position along the world-line, determined by the system\u2019s equations of motion.\n\n(b) Content Ascription Through Calibration  \nRepresentational content often flows from pragmatic calibration, not intrinsic causal structure.  A mercury thermometer only became a temperature indicator when we discovered, via calibration, the relationship between column height and temperature.  Likewise, a pendulum becomes a clock when its swings are counted against Earth\u2019s rotation.  The constitutive rule \u201cs correspond to one second\u201d is a piece of social-technical normativity, not metaphysical causation.  Nevertheless, once the rule is fixed, the physical covariance makes the device a reliable carrier of truth-valued temporal information.\n\n(c) Teleosemantics and Biological Time-Keeping  \nClark and Dretske style teleosemantic theories reinforce the point.  An organism\u2019s internal circadian oscillator, driven by transcription-translation feedback loops, has the evolutionary function of indicating time-of-day to schedule behaviour (sleep, foraging, mating).  What gives the oscillator the content that, say, \u201cit is morning\u201d is that natural selection favored systems in which that internal state correlated with dawn and led to advantageous actions.  The moon does not causally push the gene network, but photic entrainment ensures reliable covariance.  The content is fixed by historical success, not by time\u2019s causal potency.\n\n6. Is There a Genuine \u201cSense\u201d of Time?  \n\nArmed with a more sophisticated conception of sensing, we can re-evaluate whether humans enjoy a temporal sense.\n\n6.1 Endogenous Versus Exogenous Sensing  \nTypical sensory modalities are exteroceptive: vision, audition, olfaction detect external objects or properties via external energy.  Time perception resembles interoception: it depends on monitoring endogenous processes (heartbeats, neural oscillations, cortical drift-diffusion).  But interoceptive senses like proprioception and nociception are bona fide senses though they monitor internal states.  So being endogenous is no barrier.\n\n6.2 Multiple Timing Mechanisms  \nEmpirical neuroscience reveals a multiplex architecture: sub-second interval timing relies on cerebellar and basal ganglia circuits; circadian timing relies on the suprachiasmatic nucleus; long-range prospective timing involves hippocampal event segmentation.  Each subsystem relies on biochemical or electrophysiological processes that evolve in law-governed ways (decay of calcium traces, oscillations of neural populations).  Covariance with elapsed time allows the brain to use those signals as metronomes.  The brain, like the pendulum, piggybacks on physical regularities.  The sensory objection thus misfires; we possess mechanisms that behave functionally as temporal receptors, even if the \u201cstimulus\u201d is internal dynamics.\n\n6.3 Phenomenology and Representation  \nTemporal phenomenology\u2014felt duration, temporal order\u2014likely arises when the outputs of the internal timing mechanisms are integrated into higher-level representational models.  The global workspace uses these signals to tag perceptual representations with temporal metadata, yielding experience of succession.  That conscious temporality supervenes on internal covariance, not on external causal bombardment by time.  Again, causal impotence of time does no damage.\n\n7. Objections and Replies  \n\nObjection 1: Correlation is cheap; anything that changes covaries with time.  So why not say every physical process represents time?  \n\nReply: Representation requires more than covariance; it needs (i) systematic exploitable mapping, (ii) decoupling capacity\u2014i.e., it can misrepresent, and (iii) assignment of consumer-relevant content.  A lump of melting wax covaries with both ambient temperature and time, but nothing interprets that state as temporal information.  In a clock or organism, downstream consumers (user, behavioural controller) actively exploit the state to regulate action.  Teleosemantics or functional role distinguishes mere covariation from bona fide representation.\n\nObjection 2: If temporal representation hinges on calibration to other time processes (e.g., Earth\u2019s rotation), the system only measures time relative to those processes, not time itself.  \n\nReply: All measurement is relational.  Thermometers measure temperature relative to a chosen scale defined by fixed points (triple point of water).  Spatial position is measured relative to chosen coordinate frames.  That does not nullify representation; it is inherent to empirical quantities.  Temporal scales anchored to astronomical or atomic processes are as objective as any other physical measure.\n\nObjection 3: General relativity treats time as locally varying; so a single oscillator cannot track \u201ctime\u201d in curved space-time.  \n\nReply: Clocks track proper time along their world-lines.  Two clocks following different paths can disagree, but each accurately represents the invariant interval defined by the metric integral along its trajectory.  The absence of universal simultaneity does not negate the representational role; indeed, GPS satellites adjust for such relativistic drift precisely because their on-board clocks reliably represent local proper time.\n\n8. Lessons for Philosophy of Mind  \n\nThe debate illuminates broader themes.\n\nFirst, representation via internal lawful dynamics extends the palette of sensing beyond direct stimulation.  This matters for models of self-representation, interoception and predictive processing, where the brain uses endogenous generative dynamics as evidence.\n\nSecond, causal theories of perception must separate two questions: \u201cWhat causes the sensory state?\u201d and \u201cWhat does the sensory state represent?\u201d  The cause can be an underlying microphysical process; the content may be an abstract relational property supervening on that process because of systematic mappings and functional use.\n\nThird, the case of temporal sense undermines the idea that phenomenology is necessarily tied to external causal inputs.  One can be locked in a dark, soundless chamber yet vividly experience the passage of minutes.  Conscious temporality is sustained by self-generated signals.\n\n9. Conclusion  \n\nThe objection that no sense of time can exist because time is causally impotent misconstrues how information and representation operate in physical systems.  Clocks, from pendulums to caesium fountains, demonstrate that a mechanism can reliably register temporal intervals by exploiting intrinsic lawful processes whose evolution covaries with elapsed time.  The passage of time need not act as a force; the stability of the laws already embeds time into the very fabric of process.  Biological and cognitive timing mechanisms mirror this strategy, making the sense of time as genuine\u2014though distinctive\u2014as vision or hearing.  What matters is not direct causal bombardment by a temporal entity, but the existence of calibrated, law-governed covariations pragmatically appropriated for control and representation.  Once this is appreciated, the alleged causal impotence of time ceases to threaten the possibility of temporal perception.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 6, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 3494, "reasoning_tokens": 320}
{"question_id": "Viera-SenseTime-2020", "question": "A common objection to the existence of a genuine sensory system for time holds that sensory systems gather information about the world through causal influence from the relevant environmental features on those systems (e.g., photons impacting the retina for vision). Since time is often considered causally impotent\u2014it cannot exert causal force on any mechanism\u2014there cannot be a sense of time. How might one respond to this objection and explain how a clock mechanism could carry information about time without time itself causally influencing the mechanism?", "answer": "How do living creatures and artefacts such as clocks come to possess information about the passage of time when time itself\u2014unlike light, sound-waves, or chemical molecules\u2014exerts no causal pressure on them?  In what follows I offer a response in four stages.  First, I sharpen the objection by distinguishing two different senses in which something may be called \u201ccausally impotent\u201d and show why only one of those senses is relevant.  Second, I introduce a general picture of how a physical state can carry information about something even when that very property is not among the efficient causes of the state.  Third, I apply that picture to mechanical, electronic and biological clocks, explaining how they come to track elapsed time.  Finally, I draw out the broader moral: a \u201csense of time\u201d is interoceptive rather than exteroceptive.  It exploits endogenous dynamics that lawfully covary with elapsed time and can be calibrated to the external world without requiring a distinct \u201ctime particle\u201d to impinge on the sensory surface.\n\n1. Disentangling Two Notions of Causal Impotence\n\nThe complaint that \u201ctime is causally impotent\u201d is ambiguous:\n\na) Parameter-Impotence:  In standard physical theories, time appears as a parameter indexing the evolution of more fundamental magnitudes.  On this view time is not itself an additional force or field, so there is nothing for a sense organ to latch onto.\n\nb) Inefficacy-Impotence:  If a property makes no causal difference to anything\u2014if whether that property obtains or not leaves the causal nexus untouched\u2014then mechanisms cannot be sensitive to it.\n\nThe second notion would, if true of time, doom any representational relation, for informative states must be causally dependent on something.  But time fails to be a causal difference-maker only in the first, parameter sense.  The dynamical equations that govern every causal process contain an explicit t-variable, and without that variable the processes would not unfold.  An oscillator\u2019s next position, the radioactive decay of Cs-133, or the gradual conformational change of a cyanobacterial protein all differ depending on the lapse of time.  So while time supplies no extra force, the amount of time that has passed conditions the causal evolution of every ordinary force.\n\nThe objection therefore needs refinement:  because there is no \u201ctime stimulus\u201d distinct from the ordinary causal goings-on\u2014no temporons striking a receptor\u2014the brain (or a clock) cannot acquire information about elapsed time in the same way that rods and cones acquire information about wavelength.  That takes us to the second stage.\n\n2. Information Without Direct Causal Impact of the Represented Property\n\nPhilosophers since Dretske have distinguished two relations:\n\n\u2022 Information-carrying:  A state S carries the information that P when, given suitable background laws, the probability of P is 1 (or is significantly raised) conditional on S.\n\n\u2022 Information-producing:  P is among the proximate causes of S.\n\nThe crucial point is that information-carrying does not require P to cause S.  What it requires is a nomic (law-governed) regularity between P and S.  That regularity may arise because P covaries with some intervening magnitude Q which does cause S, or because S forms part of the same lawful process as P.  Three familiar measuring devices illustrate the distinction.\n\nThermometer:  The length of a mercury column covaries with temperature, not because the abstract attribute \u201ctemperature\u201d pushes the mercury upward, but because molecular kinetic energy affects the volume of mercury according to the ideal-gas law approximations.\n\nBarometer:  The height of a mercury column covaries with atmospheric pressure; again, pressure is not a stuff but a composite parameter describing force per area.  The causal route runs through collisions of air molecules on a reservoir, not through \u201cpressureness\u201d.\n\nSpeedometer:  Needle position covaries with vehicle speed, even though \u201cspeed\u201d is an abstract relational property.  What pushes the needle is magnetic flux from the rotating driveshaft.  But law-like connections ensure that so many rotations per minute mean so many kilometres per hour.\n\nLet us draw two philosophical morals.\n\nMoral 1 \u2013 Redundant Representation:  A representational system need not be impinged upon by the property it represents; it suffices that there be a reliable, counterfactual-supporting correlation produced by something.\n\nMoral 2 \u2013 Calibration Principle:  The correlation must be stable enough that the user of the representation\u2014driver, meteorologist or organism\u2014can rely on it for practical or epistemic purposes.  Calibration achieves this by setting initial conditions (zeroing the gauge, synchronising the clock) and checking for drift.\n\nWith these morals in hand we can answer the time objection by showing how clocks implement precisely this structure, the only unusual feature being that the law underwriting the correlation is the general temporal unfolding of a system\u2019s own dynamics.\n\n3. How Clocks Track Time\n\n3.1  Clocks Exploit Predictably Evolving Physical Processes\n\nAll clocks, biological or artefactual, rely on \u201creference processes\u201d whose evolution is highly predictable: pendular swings, the decay of radionuclides, electronic oscillations of quartz crystals, hyperfine transitions of caesium atoms, or chemical feedback loops in a circadian pacemaker.  If the reference process has a known period T and if we can count n complete cycles, we can infer that nT seconds have elapsed.\n\nIn causal terms:\n\nInitial State S0 at physical time t0 \u2192 (laws of dynamics L) \u2192 State Sn at physical time t0 + nT.\n\nThe mechanism that registers Sn (a set of gear teeth, a flip-flop register, a phosphorylation threshold) does not need an external shove from \u201ctime\u201d.  It is enough that Sn would not have obtained had a different amount of time passed (counterfactual sensitivity).\n\nThus the representing state (e.g., gear position, neuronal firing rate) is causally produced by earlier states of the very same mechanism plus ordinary forces.  Because the evolution is law-dictated, the representing state lawfully covaries with elapsed time.  The system is, in Dretske\u2019s sense, an information channel whose source variable is the duration since a calibration point.\n\n3.2  Synchronisation:  Closing the Loop With the World\n\nUnlike self-contained thought experiments, actual clocks must be periodically synchronised to an external event so that their count of cycles corresponds to what we call \u201cobjective\u201d time.  The calibration may be human (setting your wristwatch), astronomical (calibrating an atomic clock to Earth\u2019s rotation), or ecological (dusk resets a fruit-fly\u2019s circadian oscillator).  The resetting input is a genuinely exogenous causal signal\u2014sunlight, electrical command pulse, etc.\u2014but crucially that signal need not directly convey \u201chow much time has elapsed\u201d; it merely re-aligns the phase of the reference process with a conventionally chosen marker (solar noon, lights-on, start-gun).\n\nThe existence of calibration inputs does two jobs.  First, it brings the endogenous oscillator into phase with events that matter for action and coordination.  Second, it provides an empirical test of whether the lawlike regularity still holds.  If the oscillator drifts, the mismatch will be detected at the next calibration, prompting compensation (advance or delay).  Hence the representational link is not blind faith: it is constantly corroborated and corrected through causal feedback, ensuring high mutual information.\n\n3.3  Biological Pacemakers\n\nIf one worries that artefactual clocks win their informational status only because human engineers already understand physical time, biological pacemakers show that evolution can accomplish the same feat without foresight.  The molecular gears of the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus form a feedback loop of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of three proteins KaiA, KaiB and KaiC.  The kinetics of the loop robustly yields a \u223c24 h period across a range of temperatures.  Natural selection can reward mutations that shorten or lengthen the period to match a planet\u2019s day because an organism whose endogenous dawn prediction matches sunrise will turn on photosynthesis at the right moment.  No flagellum is shoved by \u201cday-ness\u201d; rather the temporal regularity of the loop is exploited as a proxy signal.\n\nNeurophysiological interval timing in mammals provides a psychologically closer example.  Scalar Expectancy Theory (SET) models rats and pigeons as running an internal \u201cpacemaker-accumulator\u201d: dopaminergic neurons emit pulses, a switch closes at the onset of the to-be-timed event, a counter integrates pulses until the event ends.  The accumulation rate can be pharmacologically modulated (amphetamine speeds the pacemaker, haloperidol slows it), producing predictable distortions of time estimates.  Again, the information about interval duration is present because of lawful, counterfactually robust dependence of pulse counts on real elapsed time, not because a temporal entity buffets receptors.\n\n3.4  Clocks and the Metaphysics of Time\n\nOne might object that, by appealing to the laws that govern the oscillator\u2019s change, we smuggle time back in through the laws themselves and thus fail to answer the original challenge.  The worry mistakes an explanatory level.  The clock explanation is not metaphysically prior to the concept of time; it is epistemically prior for the creature that wields the clock.  To know what time it is an agent needs a state that covaries with the temporal parameter, not a theory of what time fundamentally is.  As Bas van Fraassen puts it, representation is pragmatic fidelity to patterns, not metaphysical duplication.\n\n4. The Sense of Time as Interoception\n\nThe original objection tacitly assumes that a genuine sensory modality must be exteroceptive, driven by external stimulants impinging on a peripheral transducer.  But the bodily senses already include paradigmatic interoceptive channels: proprioception (muscle spindle stretch), vestibular balance (fluid inertia), hunger, thirst, dyspnoea, and nociception.  They turn inward, exploiting internal bodily signals to construct representations of posture, energy deficit, tissue damage, and toxin presence.  Temporal perception falls squarely within this family.\n\n4.1  Markers of Key Time Scales\n\n\u2022 Milliseconds:  The auditory system uses phase locking of cochlear neurons up to ~4 kHz to discriminate pitch, allowing localisation by inter-aural time difference as fine as 10 \u03bcs.  Those neurons are not hit by \u201cmicro-time\u201d beams; their volley code simply is the regular unfolding of their refractory periods.\n\n\u2022 Seconds:  Gap detection, temporal order judgements, and rhythm production rely on cortico-striatal loops whose oscillatory activity (beta and gamma bursts) forms cyclical reference patterns.  Disruption of the basal ganglia in Parkinson\u2019s disease yields characteristic impairments in tapping to a beat precisely because dopamine modifies the rate of the internal pacemaker.\n\n\u2022 Hours to Days:  The suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus houses a \u223c24 h biochemical oscillator affected but not driven by light.  Even in constant darkness the cycle persists, \u201cfree-running\u201d at 24.2 h and entraining when dawn resets it.\n\nDifferent scales recruit different mechanistic clocks, but all share the basic information-link:  state-of-oscillator-as-of-now \u2194 elapsed duration-since-reference-point.\n\n4.2  Phenomenology Without Exogenous Stimulation\n\nHuman introspection paints time as always present, unlike the ephemeral presence of smells or colours.  On the presented view this constancy is exactly what one would expect: because the pacemakers are endogenous, they produce representational signals whether or not the outside world is changing.  Hence in total darkness or sensory deprivation tanks subjects still experience something like the flow of time, albeit often distorted when usual calibration cues vanish.  The phenomenology is the consciousness-level correlate of an interoceptive signal.\n\n5. Addressing Four Residual Objections\n\nObjection 1:  \u201cCorrelation isn\u2019t enough; genuine representation demands that the represented property explain the correlation.\u201d\n\nReply:  For clocks, the explanation of the correlation does invoke the represented property, but in the form \u201cif \u2206t had been different, pendulum phase would have been different.\u201d  That is a counterfactual dependency sufficient for explanatory relevance.  No extra causal arrow from \u201ctime\u201d to pendulum is needed, just the law\u2019s time-indexed form.\n\nObjection 2:  \u201cEndogenous clocks are like rulers\u2014they measure length but do not sense it.\u201d\n\nReply:  A ruler provides information only when an agent deliberately aligns it with an object; nothing in its internal states signals length spontaneously.  An oscillator, by contrast, continuously produces updateable markers (ticks).  The organism does not need a distinct act to obtain a temporal estimate; pulses accumulate automatically and can be read out by downstream neural circuits that initiate action at threshold.  That is enough like spontaneous firing of photoreceptors to count as a sensory channel.\n\nObjection 3:  \u201cYour story generalises to any law-governed variable: blood glucose covaries with time since breakfast, so why not call glucose a clock?\u201d\n\nReply:  Information utility and calibration frequency impose constraints.  A variable is a clock only if (i) its dynamics are sufficiently monotonic and predictable over the time scale of interest, and (ii) the system exploiting it has access to mechanisms for mapping that variable to action-relevant intervals.  Blood glucose fails on (i) because its evolution depends on contingent metabolic events; by contrast, pendulum length and gravity yield a period independent of amplitude (to first order).  So the account avoids trivialising representation.\n\nObjection 4:  \u201cEven if a creature can track duration, it still lacks a sense of temporal order or direction (past vs future).\u201d\n\nReply:  Order can be coded by tagging events with the accumulated pulse count at time of encoding and storing those tags in memory; retrieval then delivers correct temporal precedence.  Direction is built into the irreversible dissipation of the pacemaker\u2019s microstates (thermodynamic arrow).  Thus relative order and directionality piggyback on duration representation plus one-way causal storage.\n\n6. Conclusion\n\nThe charge that the absence of a distinct causal \u201ctime stimulus\u201d rules out a sense of time conflates two ideas: that representing demands impingement, and that causal efficacy must come only from the represented property.  Measure-instruments and living systems refute both.  They gain information whenever there exists (1) a lawful, counterfactually robust dependence between their internal states and some external condition, and (2) a calibration mechanism that keeps that dependence accurate enough for use.  Clocks satisfy these criteria through internal reference processes whose progression is itself causally sensitive to the amount of time elapsed\u2014sensitive not because time is a force but because the laws governing any physical process are time-indexed.  Biological temporal perception is therefore an interoceptive capacity that exploits regular endogenous dynamics and need not postulate a sui generis \u201cchronoreceptor\u201d.  In short, one can have perception of time without time knocking on the door, because every physical process is already keeping step to time\u2019s silent beat.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 7, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 3823, "reasoning_tokens": 640}

How might one respond to this objection and explain how a clock mechanism could carry information about time without time itself causally influencing the mechanism?", "answer": "1. Introduction: the \u201ccausal-impotence\u201d objection  \nA familiar story in philosophy of perception begins with a simple maxim: to be sensed, a property must act on the sense organ. Light excites photoreceptors, airborne chemicals stimulate olfactory neurons, variations in air pressure jog mechanoreceptors. Because \u201ctime itself\u201d seemingly exerts no direct push or pull on a transducer, some conclude that there can be no strictly sensory system for time. The conclusion looks bolstered by a picture of clocks: a bell-tower clock keeps track of the hours, yet nothing like a \u201ctemporal particle\u201d ever strikes its gears. How, then, could either an artefactual clock or a biological nervous system bear information about elapsed time?  \n\nBelow I argue that the objection relies on an overly restrictive conception of sensory information and a mistaken picture of what is required for a mechanism to represent or measure a dimension. After clarifying what it means to say that a system carries information, I show how a clock can lawfully covary with temporal intervals without requiring \u201ccausal influence from time.\u201d The key ideas are (i) correlation rather than direct stimulation, (ii) calibration and error-detectability, and (iii) internal generative dynamics that are themselves temporally regimented. Once those ideas are in place, nothing bars us from speaking of genuine chronoreception in biological systems.  \n\n2. Reassessing the \u201ccontact\u201d requirement  \nA first quick reply notes that many paradigmatic measuring devices do not maintain contact with a distinctive substance corresponding to the measured magnitude. Thermometers, for instance, measure temperature, yet there is no \u201ctemperature fluid\u201d that flows into the bulb. What matters is that the mercury column\u2019s length L is nomically related to mean molecular kinetic energy \u27e8E\u27e9: given the relevant boundary conditions, L = k \u00b7 \u27e8E\u27e9. Likewise, a barometer tracks atmospheric pressure, but pressure never bombards the barometer by itself; instead, the weight of air molecules transmits a force to the column of mercury. What the measuring device exploits is a reliable law-bound relation, not a unique causal vector labelled \u2018pressure\u2019 or \u2018temperature\u2019.  \n\nTime is similar. Time is a dimension along which every physical process unfolds, and temporal intervals can be encoded in other, more directly causal processes\u2014oscillations, decays, rotations, phase changes. The causal stage is already crowded with ordinary physical events; we need not treat \u2018time\u2019 as another entity that must somehow join the causal chorus.  \n\n3. Information without external stimulation  \nTo make that point rigorous, it helps to separate two questions:  \n\n   a. What is the causal path that produces the representational state inside the system?  \n   b. What property of the environment does that state carry information about?  \n\nAccording to mainstream causal-informational theories (Dretske 1981; Fodor 1990) and to Shannon\u2019s quantification of information, a state S carries information that P just in case there is a reliable, law-grounded correlation between S and P in the relevant circumstances. Crucially, the proposition P need not itself describe the feature that causally generated S; it only has to be nomically linked to that generating feature. Dretske\u2019s favorite example is a gauge on a tanker truck. The needle\u2019s movement is brought about by changes in electrical resistance, but what the needle tells the driver is how much gasoline is left, because in the calibrated context resistance covaries with volume.  \n\nIn exactly this sense, a clock\u2019s internal state carries information about elapsed time because the phase of its oscillator covaries with the temporal metric according to a known law: t = n \u00b7 \u03c4 where \u03c4 is the oscillator\u2019s period and n the number of completed cycles. There is still causation\u2014friction, elasticity, inertial forces\u2014but the causation links material features of the oscillator at distinct moments. Time is the parameter that structures the lawful relation; it need not be an additional causal agent.  \n\n4. The pendulum clock as a case study  \nConsider Huygens\u2019 pendulum clock. Given local gravity g and rod length l, small-angle oscillations obey T \u2248 2\u03c0\u221a(l/g). Once the pendulum is set swinging, nothing external need interact with it for the next several hours. Yet each swing marks another T seconds. An observer watching the escapement wheel can, by counting swings, recover the elapsed time since the pendulum was released. The source of the representation is an internal causal process (gravity acting on the bob, inertia returning it), but what is represented is the temporal interval.  \n\nThe analogy is clearer when we recall that a mercury thermometer can be read without contact once put into an insulated container: after reaching equilibrium, the mercury level remains fixed and tells us the temperature that obtained at the equilibration moment. We do not complain that \u2018temperature did nothing\u2019 to shift the column after that moment. By parity of reasoning, we should not demand that \u2018time do something\u2019 at each tick of a clock.  \n\n5. Clocks, covariance, and nomic dependence  \nWhy should covariance be sufficient for representation? One answer invokes the notion of nomic dependence: state S represents property P when (i) S is produced by a process lawfully sensitive to P, and (ii) the consumer of S is adapted (by design or by evolution) to exploit the correlation so as to perform some function\u2014guiding behavior, updating beliefs, coordinating action. A reading lamp\u2019s switch does not \u201crepresent\u201d anything because there is no consumer that treats the switch position as a source of information; a marine chronometer, by contrast, is designed so that the pointer registers degrees of longitude when read by a navigator, and every stage of its manufacture is constrained by the demand for accurate timekeeping.  \n\nNotice: the crucial link tying the internal state to the environmental magnitude is the lawlike mapping, not a direct, continuous causal bombardment by the magnitude. In technical terms, the internal variable is an index of a parameter in the system\u2019s own equation of motion; time is that parameter.  \n\n6. Biological chronoreception  \nThe brain appears to use the very same strategy. Neurons in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) cycle with an approximately 24-hour rhythm owing to transcription-translation feedback loops. Again, what drives the intracellular concentrations of Bmal1 or Per proteins are chemical reactions influenced by the current state of the cell, not a mysterious causal influx of \u2018circadian time\u2019. Still, the phase of the oscillation carries information about the time of day, and downstream areas exploit that information to modulate hormone secretion, body temperature, and sleep\u2013wake cycles.  \n\nAt shorter timescales, cerebellar Purkinje cells, striatal medium spiny neurons, and cortical ramping neurons exhibit dynamics that correlate with intervals from tens of milliseconds to several seconds. Psychophysical data show that humans can detect deviations in regularly spaced auditory clicks as small as 10 ms, and functional imaging links that capacity to oscillatory subcortical circuits. No exotic temporal force is needed; neurodynamics themselves unfold at particular rates, and the brain has learned to treat those rates as temporal counters.  \n\n7. Objection: mere correlation is not sensation  \nOne may object that correlation tout court is too cheap; after all, my beard length covaries with the number of days since I last shaved, yet my beard is not a sensory organ. Two additional conditions fend off the charge of cheapness.  \n\nFirst, the correlation must be highly reliable and exploitable. A quartz clock\u2019s resonance frequency at 32,768 Hz is extraordinarily stable across contexts; that stability explains why downstream logic gates can interpret each 215th oscillation as exactly one second. Beards, by contrast, grow at different rates depending on temperature, hormones, and age, and we have no evolved or designed system that \u201creads\u201d follicle length to plan temporally sensitive action.  \n\nSecond, calibration and error-detectability must be possible. Clocks drift; living systems adapt; both must be correctable. A pendulum clock includes a length-adjustment screw, a watch includes a regulator lever, and the SCN includes light-sensitive retinal inputs permitting phase reset. Where there is a norm of correctness, there is representation: the system can mis-represent when uncalibrated. Beards provide no such standard.  \n\n8. Does the account trivialize causation?  \nAnother worry is that the reply re-describes every ordinary causal process in temporal terms, making time tracking trivial. But note: not every causal process is usable as a clock. An ideal chronometric process must satisfy at least three constraints: (i) monotonicity\u2014state changes must order time without reversals; (ii) homogeneity\u2014units must be of equal duration; and (iii) decouplability\u2014rate must be insensitive to most environmental perturbations. Radioactive decay, for instance, is monotonic but not well-suited for a wristwatch because the variance in decay intervals is large at short timescales. Boiling water bubbles appear periodic but are wildly affected by contaminants and pressure. Only special processes such as harmonic oscillations in crystalline lattices meet all three constraints in a broad range of contexts. So the present proposal in no way collapses the distinction between generic causation and chronometric utility.  \n\n9. Time, structure, and the metaphysics of influence  \nThe causal-impotence worry may also stem from a metaphysical view on which time is an empty container, a Newtonian receptacle in which events are placed. If that were correct, one might think a genuine sense of time would require awareness of the container as such. But many philosophers now endorse a relational or structural conception: temporal facts supervene on patterns of events and the laws connecting them. On a relational picture, to track time is precisely to track those patterns. A mechanism does so by being one such pattern whose internal evolution mirrors the metric relations among events. The \u201cabsence of temporal influence\u201d is therefore not a defect; it is a mark that time is not an entity alongside causal processes but rather a structural aspect of their unfolding.  \n\n10. \u201cInternal\u201d versus \u201cexternal\u201d senses  \nEven granting the dialectical point, one might, for taxonomic reasons, resist calling the relevant mechanisms \u201csensory.\u201d Yet there are familiar proprioceptive senses\u2014vestibular balance, kinesthetic feedback, hunger, nociception\u2014that do not rely on environmental impingement from outside the skin. They are nonetheless bona fide senses because (i) they employ specialized receptors, (ii) their signals travel dedicated neural pathways, and (iii) they subserve perception-like functions such as guiding action and informing belief. Temporal estimation circuitry satisfies the same tripartite test.  \n\n11. Putting the pieces together: a functional definition of a time sense  \nWe can therefore sketch a functional account of chronoreception:  \n\n   A system S implements a sense of time relative to a temporal range R just in case  \n   1. S contains an internal process P whose state space is homomorphic to R (e.g., phase angles of an oscillator to seconds within a minute).  \n   2. The evolution of P is governed by laws that make the mapping between state and elapsed time sufficiently stable under background conditions.  \n   3. Downstream consumer systems C use the state of P, under a norm of accuracy, to guide behavior or inference about timing.  \n   4. There exists a calibration procedure whereby mismatches between P\u2019s predicted and actual relations to external events can be detected and corrected.  \n\nThis functional profile captures artefacts (clocks and chronometers) and biological systems (circadian pacemakers, cerebellar timing circuits). The profile does not require \u201ctime to cause P\u201d; it only requires ordinary causal chains within P and between P and C, plus the nomic regularity that makes those chains clock-like.  \n\n12. Conclusion  \nThe objection that a sense of time is impossible because time cannot causally influence a receptor trades on two conflations: (a) that representation requires direct stimulation by the represented property, and (b) that time, if not a causal substance, cannot ground reliable correlations. Both conflations are false. Information theory, the practice of instrumentation science, and the empirical study of biological timing all show how a magnitude can be represented whenever there is (i) an internal variable evolving in accord with a law in which the magnitude figures as a parameter, and (ii) a user that exploits the variable under a norm of correctness.  \n\nClocks\u2014from quartz wristwatches to the brain\u2019s suprachiasmatic nucleus\u2014carry temporal information precisely because the lawful evolution of their internal states mirrors the metric structure of temporal intervals. The causal story is entirely ordinary: elastic restoring forces, electric fields, biochemical reactions. Time does not sit outside these processes pushing them along; rather, it is the structural dimension they jointly instantiate. Recognizing this dissolves the causal-impotence worry and opens theoretical space to treat chronoreception as a genuine sensory modality\u2014one whose receptors are oscillators, whose transduction is phase progress, and whose perceptual deliverance is our experience of duration, succession, and rhythm.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 8, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 3349, "reasoning_tokens": 576}

How might one respond to this objection and explain how a clock mechanism could carry information about time without time itself causally influencing the mechanism?", "answer": "1. Introduction  \n\nHumans and many other organisms manifest an impressive ability to keep track of time.  We can tap a rhythm, anticipate the moment a traffic light will turn green, or organise multi-year projects whose stages must be sequenced with temporal precision.  Neuroscientists have identified circuits\u2014basal ganglia oscillators, cerebellar timing micro-complexes, cortical ramping neurons\u2014that seem dedicated to these competences, and psychologists measure timing acuity with the same experimental care they lavish on vision or audition.  Yet a long-standing philosophical objection maintains that there cannot literally be a \u201csense\u201d of time.  Sensory systems, the objection says, work by being causally affected by the very features they detect: light perturbs photoreceptor cells, pressure deforms mechanoreceptors, airborne molecules bind to olfactory cilia.  Time, however, is causally inert.  If time is a dimension along which change occurs, rather than a force or field, it cannot strike, push, or in any other way causally impinge on a receptor.  So, although we talk loosely about a time sense, strictly speaking no such sense is possible.\n\nThat argument looks powerful, but it rests on a too-narrow picture of how biological and artefactual information-gathering devices work.  In what follows I develop a reply in four stages.  First, I diagnose the hidden assumption that the detected property must itself be the proximate physical cause of the receptor\u2019s state.  Second, I show\u2014using familiar scientific instruments as examples\u2014that many genuine measuring devices violate that assumption.  Third, I explain how clocks, biological or mechanical, can lawfully acquire information about time without time exerting any distinctive causal influence.  Finally, I address residual worries about representation and evolutionary justification, closing with a broader moral about the nature of sensory systems and the metaphysics of time.\n\n\n\n2. The Objection Laid Bare  \n\nLet us begin by disaggregating the objection.  It has three premises:\n\n1. Sensory systems (and measuring instruments generally) require a causal chain that runs from the distal property P to the state of the receptor R.\n\n2. Time is not the kind of entity that can stand in causal relations; it is not a force, field, particle stream, or energetic flux.\n\n3. Therefore no receptor can stand in an information-carrying causal nexus with time.  Hence no genuine temporal sense.\n\nThe inferential move from (1) and (2) to (3) depends on equating \u201cproperty P\u201d with \u201cthat which exerts the causally operative influence.\u201d  The thermometer receives information about temperature because temperature, construed as mean kinetic energy of molecules, causes the mercury column to expand; vision works because photons cause conformational change in retinal opsins, and so on.  If every sensory modality exhibits that template, then failure of time to play the causal role would indeed preclude a time sense.\n\nBut is that template universal?  We can expose its limitations by distinguishing two causal roles: (i) the cause of a signal S\u2019s being in some state s, and (ii) the property about which S carries information.  These roles sometimes coincide, but often they do not.  Once we pry them apart, premise (1) is revealed as an over-generalisation.\n\n\n\n3. Causation, Correlation, and Representation  \n\nConsider three devices whose credentials as genuine measuring instruments are uncontroversial.\n\na) The Mercury Thermometer.  Strictly speaking, what directly pushes the mercury up the glass tube is not the abstract property temperature but the mechanical collisions of faster-moving air molecules against the bulb.  If those collisions embodied some different micro-physical correlate\u2014say, pressure generated by a pump\u2014while preserving the same functional relation between column height and the distal variable, the thermometer would still carry accurate temperature information.  The proximate cause of the reading is distinct from the property reported.\n\nb) The Bar Code Scanner.  A laser beam reflects off alternating black and white bars; a photodiode picks up the reflected intensity profile.  The scanner represents product identity, yet what causally affects the sensor is merely the reflectance contrast within a tiny patch of surface\u2014a correlate of the integer that is the Universal Product Code.  Here, too, representation outstrips immediate causal impact.\n\nc) The Gyroscope.  Spinning rotors maintain orientation in virtue of angular momentum conservation, not because \u201cabsolute space\u201d presses against the instrument.  If we adopt a relational view \u00e0 la Mach or Einstein, there is nothing ontologically robust called space that does causal work; nevertheless gyroscopes reliably indicate orientation because their internal dynamics instantiate lawful correlations with that orientation.\n\nFrom these examples we can extract a moral: what makes a physical state a representation of some property P is not that P itself is the direct cause of that state, but that, across the range of circumstances in which the system is designed or has evolved to operate, the state is a dependable correlate of P, exploitable by downstream consumers (other circuits, engineers, organisms).  In information-theoretic vocabulary, mutual information suffices; direct causal contact with P is optional.\n\n\n\n4. Clocks as Temporal Transducers  \n\nLet us now turn to clock mechanisms, the paradigmatic time-keeping devices.  A clock has two components:\n\ni) A dynamical process that repeats, oscillates, or accumulates change at a stable rate.\n\nii) A counter, dial, or comparator that maps the current phase or accumulated change of that process onto a time reading or a motor command.\n\nIn a pendulum clock, gravity and length fix the oscillation period via the equation T = 2\u03c0\u221a(L/g).  In a quartz watch, the lattice structure of the crystal and the piezoelectric effect generate a 32,768 Hz resonance.  In an atomic clock, the hyperfine transition frequency of caesium-133\u2014exactly 9,192,631,770 Hz by definition\u2014provides the standard.  None of these devices is driven by \u201cflows\u201d of time.  Rather, each exploits a lawful regularity: given certain boundary conditions, the physical system evolves through its state-space at a rate that is (nearly) invariant when expressed in conventional time units.  The clock extracts temporal information by counting iterations of that regular cycle.\n\nBecause the regularity is lawful, a reliable correlation holds between the number of cycles completed and the objective temporal duration elapsed, whether or not time does any causal work.  The device\u2019s capacity to represent time thus piggybacks on second-order facts about laws, not first-order causal pushes from time.  The same point scales down to the nervous system.  Pacemaker-accumulator models, cortical oscillatory interference models, and cerebellar state-dependent networks all posit some quasi-regular neural dynamics.  When the organism calibrates those dynamics\u2014through development, learning, or evolutionary design\u2014so that n cycles \u2248 one second, the resulting internal variable can be read by other neural subsystems as \u201ccurrent duration.\u201d  Time information is carried internally, without a dedicated external stimulus.\n\nThis account matches empirical findings.  Short-term timing (millisecond to seconds range) persists in darkness, in silence, under immobilisation, even under pharmacological blockade of exteroceptive input.  What disrupts timing most dramatically are manipulations that disturb the intrinsic pacemakers\u2014dopaminergic drugs, cerebellar lesions, hypothermia.  That profile looks exactly like what our lawful-regularity model predicts.\n\n\n\n5. Does Information without Causal Action Suffice?  \n\nA sceptic might grant that clocks exhibit correlations with elapsed time, yet still worry that such correlations are \u201caccidental\u201d or ungrounded if time itself is not in the causal story.  But the correlations are far from accidental.  They follow from the dynamical laws of the systems in question.  For a simple harmonic oscillator, the period\u2019s independence from amplitude (for small angles) mathematically entails a linear mapping between cycle count and Newtonian time parameter t.  In the quartz crystal, the dispersion relation for acoustic phonons depends on lattice constants that are exceedingly stable under ordinary environmental variations.  The lawful regularity provides precisely the modal robustness we expect genuine information to exhibit: had slightly different micro-states arisen, the mapping would still have held; under various counterfactual perturbations, unless those perturbations break the law-grounding conditions, the reading would remain faithful.\n\nPhilosophers of science sometimes call this phenomenon indirect measurement.  We measure \u03bb (wavelength) of light in a Michelson interferometer, not because \u03bb \u201chits\u201d the detector, but because stationary fringe patterns arise lawfully from path-length differences.  Similarly, a clock measures time indirectly via the lawful evolution of its internal variable.\n\nAdmittedly, the metaphysical status of laws is itself contested.  But even on the Humean mosaic, regularities are patterns in the temporal ordering of local events, and the clock simply embeds a micro-pattern that mirrors a macro-pattern.  No breach in causal empiricism appears.\n\n\n\n6. What about Sense Organs?  \n\nStill, one might insist, thermometers and clocks are instruments, not sense organs.  Organisms evolved eyes and ears because they needed information about uninternalisable external magnitudes; clocks are detachable artefacts.  Yet the line between organ and instrument is blurry.  Owls possess magnetite crystals that respond to Earth\u2019s magnetic field; sharks have ampullae of Lorenzini sensitive to electric fields.  These receptors piggyback on their own regularities: a magnetic field is not a force that targets a biological signal transduction pathway, yet magnetoreception remains bona fide.  The brain\u2019s pacemaker networks, vestibular hair cells, and proprioceptive spindles are all endogenously active, requiring only generic nutrients and thermodynamic conditions to cycle.  Their outputs are integrated with exteroceptive input and commandeered for prediction, motor coordination, and learning.  The theoretical roles they play\u2014information provision, error correction, action guidance\u2014are indistinguishable from the roles of vision and audition.\n\nMoreover, the very evolutionary utility of timing undermines the causal objection.  Selection cannot reward a trait unless reliable correlations exist between the trait\u2019s output and fitness-relevant states of the world.  If internal oscillators lacked such correlations, timing behaviours would not improve survival.  Their persistence in diverse lineages is therefore powerful indirect evidence that the correlations are lawful and robust enough to fuel adaptation.\n\n\n\n7. Are We Still \u201cTracking\u201d Time Itself?  \n\nA deeper objection appeals to the metaphysics of what is tracked.  Perhaps clocks and brains merely track the motion of their own parts\u2014oscillations, decay processes\u2014and we read temporal content into those motions.  The representational status is then a projection, not an objective transactional fact.  To answer this we need a theory of representation generous enough to allow that a state can represent some distal magnitude M even if M is not registered through direct force transmission, provided that (i) the system was produced or sustained because its states covary with M, and (ii) the system exploits that covariation for control or inference.\n\nSuch teleosemantic or use-based accounts are already standard in the philosophy of perception.  A frog\u2019s \u201cbug detector\u201d retinal circuit is sensitive to small moving dark dots; it will indiscriminately snap at a simulating dot on a screen.  The circuit qualifies as representing bugs because ancestral frogs that used the correlation between dot-motion and edible insects had higher fitness.  Likewise, timing circuits have been selected (or, in the human case, culturally tuned) because their outputs covary with objective duration in ways that facilitate navigation, foraging, communication, and social coordination.  The representational link is indirect but no less real.\n\nOne might press still harder: what fixes the metric of time that clocks are supposed to match?  After all, the second is defined by a particular atomic transition.  Does that not render clock correlations tautological?  Here the response is pluralist.  Any monotonically increasing physical process could, in principle, serve as a surrogate time parameter.  What matters is relational consistency: whichever process we pick, the internal states of clocks and organisms remain systematically aligned with the order and duration structure that defines physical laws (e.g., Newtonian or relativistic dynamics).  If our planet\u2019s inhabitants calibrated everything to a different oscillator, dynamical equations would adjust accordingly; experiential and behavioural coordination would survive.  So the clock\u2019s information is about objective temporal structure in the same sense that a ruler\u2019s markings are about spatial length, despite length being definable via the speed of light times a temporal interval.\n\n\n\n8. Lessons from Relativity  \n\nSpecial relativity might seem to complicate the picture: observers in different inertial frames disagree about simultaneity and duration.  Does that undermine the idea of a single temporal magnitude clocks represent?  Not really.  Each clock embodies proper time along its worldline, an invariant in relativistic physics.  The causal inertness objection, if sound, would preclude any clock from measuring proper time, yet relativistic experiments routinely verify that atomic clocks on high-speed aircraft or in gravitational wells display time dilation exactly as predicted.  The fact that no mysterious \u201ctime force\u201d acts differently on fast-moving versus slow-moving clocks strengthens our thesis: lawful internal dynamics suffice.\n\n\n\n9. Objection from Illusion and Distortion  \n\nPsychophysical data reveal systematic timing illusions.  A burst of adrenaline shortens perceived intervals; saccadic eye movements compress temporal sequence; attention modulates the apparent order of tones.  Do these distortions imply that the internal variable is merely an heuristic fiction?  No.  Visual illusions coexist with a robust sense of space, and auditory illusions with a robust sense of pitch.  Distortion shows only that the internal variable is modifiable by context and resource constraints.  In fact, illusion patterns teach us something important: timing mechanisms are integrated with other sensory modalities and decision systems, not encapsulated.  If timing were just a memory of oscillations with no external significance, such cross-modal interactions would be puzzling.  Their ubiquity confirms that temporal information really is being used to interpret and predict the environment.\n\n\n\n10. Putting the Pieces Together  \n\nWe can now articulate a general schema for how a system S can sense a property P even if P is not itself causally operative.\n\n1. There exists some physical process X internal to S whose state variable x(t) evolves according to a law L.\n\n2. Across normal operating conditions, L guarantees a stable, monotonic mapping f such that x(t) = f(t) (perhaps up to minimal noise).\n\n3. S contains further mechanisms that sample x and, via learned or evolved decoding rules, deploy its current value to regulate behaviour Y.\n\n4. Because of evolutionary contingency or deliberate design, success of Y depends on accurate alignment of x with t; misalignment is penalised.\n\nThe combination of (2) and (4) makes x an indicator of t: perturbations in t would, via L, covary with x, and downstream consumers exploit that covariation.  No additional causal arrow from t to S is required.\n\nApplied to photoreception, the schema collapses into the familiar causal story because light\u2019s impact is the most efficient way to obtain a law-grounded mapping from luminance to receptor potential.  Applied to timing, the schema manifests as internal oscillators and counters.  The phenomenological sense of duration that accompanies their operation is a high-level readout of this circuitry, just as colour qualia are a readout of photoreceptor balance.\n\n\n\n11. Objections Revisited  \n\n\u2022 \u201cCorrelation without causation is coincidence.\u201d  Reply: lawful reliability is the opposite of coincidence; it supports counterfactuals and practical exploitation.\n\n\u2022 \u201cInformation must flow from outside in.\u201d  Reply: vestibular, proprioceptive, and interoceptive senses already undermine that dictum; they chiefly monitor organism-generated dynamics.\n\n\u2022 \u201cIf time does not cause anything, the representation is empty.\u201d  Reply: emptiness would follow only if causal action were the sole ground of representational content; but use-based, teleosemantic, and structuralist accounts furnish alternative grounds.\n\n\n\n12. Conclusion  \n\nThe objection that a temporal sense is impossible because time is causally impotent conflates two distinct requirements for sensing: (a) that there be a causal process producing the receptor state, and (b) that the property represented be the direct causal agent.  While (a) is indispensable\u2014the receptor\u2019s state must arise somehow\u2014(b) is not.  Time measurement is achieved via internal dynamical regularities whose lawful evolution maps neatly onto objective duration.  Clocks, whether brass pendulums, quartz slivers, caesium fountains, or cortical oscillators, do not need to be pushed by time; they need only to embody processes whose unfolding mirrors time\u2019s metric structure.  Once this is recognised, the putative impossibility of a time sense evaporates.

How might one respond to this objection and explain how a clock mechanism could carry information about time without time itself causally influencing the mechanism?", "answer": "1. INTRODUCTION: THE \u201cCAUSAL IMPOTENCE\u201d OBJECTION\n\nThe worry that there can be no genuine sense of time because time does not causally impinge on sensory receptors seems, at first glance, extremely compelling. Vision, audition, olfaction, touch, and taste all operate through direct causal interactions: photons strike photoreceptors, pressure deforms mechanoreceptors, air\u2010borne molecules bind to olfactory epithelium, and so on. If information always originates in a causal encounter between a worldly feature and the receptor surface, and if time itself is not the sort of thing that can collide with or chemically interact with anything, the idea of a \u201csense of time\u201d appears incoherent. After all, what would be doing the bumping?  \n\nYet human and non-human animals alike manifest robust time-keeping abilities\u2014ranging from millisecond-precision interval timing in songbirds to circadian regulation in virtually all mammals. Even bacteria entrain their physiology to daily light\u2013dark cycles, and our own brains can estimate durations, anticipate rhythms, and notice temporal order. Empirically, then, organisms clearly possess mechanisms that carry accurate information about time. The philosophical task is to explain how such information is possible without positing a mysterious causal \u201cpressure\u201d exerted by time itself.\n\nI shall argue that the objection rests on an overly restrictive picture of how information gets into sensory systems\u2014namely, the idea that representation requires a direct, single-stage causal impact by the represented property. Once we replace that picture with a more sophisticated, multi-stage, lawful-covariance account of information (building on Dretske, Millikan, Craver, and contemporary work in the philosophy of neuroscience), the puzzle dissolves. A clock\u2014biological or artefactual\u2014carries information about time because of the lawful way its own internal physical processes unfold, not because time pokes it. The organism exploits predictable regularities in those processes, often calibrated by environmental scaffolding (light\u2013dark cycles, seasonal changes, social routines), to build reliable temporal representations. \u201cSensing\u201d time, therefore, is more like sensing temperature with a thermometer than like seeing colour with the eye: a thermometer does not need to be hit by \u201ctemperature rays\u201d; instead, it instantiates a physical process (thermal expansion) whose state covaries lawfully with ambient temperature. Analogously, a clock instantiates a dynamical process whose state covaries lawfully with elapsed temporal intervals. That lawful covariation, suitably harnessed by a neuro-cognitive user, underwrites genuine temporal representation.\n\n2. WHAT DOES \u201cCAUSALLY DRIVE\u201d A SENSORY SYSTEM?\n\nBefore defending this claim, we must clarify a crucial ambiguity in the objection. Philosophers sometimes conflate two very different senses in which an environmental feature might be said to \u201cdrive\u201d a receptor:\n\na. Direct mechanical or chemical impact: The environment exerts a force (whether photonic, acoustic, or molecular) on a transducer, thereby producing an immediate physiological response.\n\nb. Subtler, law-governed covariance: The internal state of a mechanism changes in a way that is reliably correlated with some environmental parameter, even if no single event counts as that parameter \u201cstriking\u201d the mechanism.\n\nVision, audition, and other paradigm senses certainly instantiate (a). But not every case of representation or measurement needs to. Scientific instruments often work via (b). A barometer represents atmospheric pressure because the height of the mercury column covaries with pressure by virtue of a physical law, though pressure does not batter the glass tube. Likewise, geologists can read geological time from radioactive decay rates: the proportion of parent to daughter isotopes \u201ctells\u201d how long a specimen has been decaying, even though \u201ctime\u201d never hits the rock.\n\nTherefore, the demand that genuine information must arise from type-(a) contact is gratuitous. What matters, from an informational standpoint, is systematic, exploitable covariance. If there is a reliable, law-governed mapping from some internal state S of the organism to worldly condition W, and if the organism has evolved or learned to treat S as indicative of W, then S carries information about W in the sense relevant to cognition and action.\n\n3. LAWFUL COVARIANCE, INFORMATION, AND INDICATION\n\nFred Dretske\u2019s epistemic-teleological account provides a helpful framework. For Dretske (1981), a physical state S is an information bearer for condition W if:\n\ni. Conditional probability: P(W | S) = 1 (or very close) under the channel conditions C.  \nii. Exploitability: A consumer system has access to S and can use it to do something appropriate with respect to W.\n\nS can satisfy (i) even if W never causally interacts with S \u201chead-on.\u201d The key is that the conditional dependence between W and S is fixed by a mechanism\u2014that is, by laws of nature\u2014so that S would not occur unless W were true. Radioactive isotopic ratios satisfy (i) in virtue of nuclear physics. Similarly, the mixed\u2010orientation of the gears in a mechanical clock satisfies (i) relative to elapsed intervals because, given the stability of the oscillatory process (e.g., the swinging pendulum or quartz crystal resonance), the gear positions encode how many cycles have passed since a reference point. Pendulum length, gravity, and mass secure the law; time does not have to do additional causal work.\n\nMillikan\u2019s teleosemantics adds a functional\u2010historical element: a mechanism\u2019s outputs count as representations of some magnitude when the mechanism was selected (by evolution, learning, or design) because those outputs enabled successful behaviour in virtue of correlating with that magnitude. A circadian gene network that drives photosynthesis in cyanobacteria represents time-of-day precisely because, historically, its phase alignment with dawn and dusk enhanced reproductive fitness. Again, no \u201ctime force\u201d needed.\n\n4. CLOCKS AS SELF\u2010CONTAINED TEMPORAL INDICATORS\n\nSo how can a clock indicate time? Consider a simple pendulum clock:\n\n\u2022 The escapement mechanism permits one tooth of the gear to advance for each swing.  \n\u2022 Given harmonic motion, the period T is (to first approximation) determined by pendulum length and gravity: T = 2\u03c0\u221a(L/g).  \n\u2022 If the escapement allows exactly one gear tooth per half-period, then n teeth correspond to elapsed time t = n\u00b7T/2.\n\nAll causal oomph here is supplied by the pendulum-gear coupling, gravitational acceleration, restricted friction, etc. Time enters only as an abstract parameter in the equations of motion. Yet the position of the hands after n ticks is informative about t, because the state of the system could not be what it is unless that amount of time had elapsed. The possession of a lawful dynamical invariant\u2014constant period\u2014is what matters, not a separate causal influence of time.\n\nOne might object: \u201cIsn\u2019t the pendulum\u2019s motion itself taking place in time, so isn\u2019t time somehow involved causally?\u201d But this confuses two ways of talking. Of course every physical process is temporally extended. Nonetheless, on orthodoxy from Newton to relativity, temporal extension is not a force; it does not push objects along. Forces are vectors in spacetime; time is the dimension along which those vectors operate. By analogy, the spatial dimension \u2018north-south\u2019 does not cause a train to move north. What moves the train are electromagnetic and mechanical forces; the dimension merely supplies the coordinate along which movement is measured. Likewise, the pendulum moves because of gravity and inertia, while its regularity furnishes a measure of time.\n\n5. BIOLOGICAL CLOCKS AND ENDOGENOUS OSCILLATORS\n\nHuman interval timing and circadian systems exemplify the same basic architecture. Neurons in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) exhibit roughly 24-hour gene expression cycles due to delayed negative feedback loops among transcription factors (e.g., CLOCK, BMAL, PER, CRY). The period persists even in constant darkness: cultured SCN slices keep oscillating. An animal\u2019s behaviour entrains to these internal oscillations, and downstream tissues use SCN output to schedule hormone release, feeding, and sleep. The phase of the oscillation therefore stands in a robust, law-governed relation to elapsed time since the last subjective midnight. Light does not have to \u201ctell\u201d the SCN what time it is every second; rather, periodic light input (via melanopsin cells in the retina) resets the oscillator daily, preventing cumulative drift. The mechanism does the fine-grained tracking; the environment provides periodic calibration.\n\nThe same principle applies at shorter scales. Cerebellar circuits rely on cascades of calcium dynamics whose decay rates track hundreds of milliseconds, enabling eyeblink conditioning. Cortico-striatal loops accumulate pulses from thalamo-cortical oscillators to gauge seconds to minutes, critical for foraging and speech. All such systems use internal dynamical processes whose parameter values correlate with elapsed duration under normal operating conditions. No extra \u201ctime particle\u201d hits the receptors.\n\n6. SENSING WITHOUT IMPACT: COMPARISONS WITH THERMOMETERS AND SPEEDOMETERS\n\nTemperature again offers a clarifying analogy. Temperature is not a basic force; it is a statistical property of microstates. Mercury\u2019s volumetric expansion law means V(T) increases monotonically with temperature T, so reading the height of the column implicates T though nothing literally \u201cbumps\u201d the mercury in virtue of being \u201ctemperature.\u201d Similarly, a car\u2019s speedometer infers linear velocity from rotation rate of the wheels; distance sensors inside the transmission gear, not \u201cspeed quanta,\u201d drive the dial. Many philosophical analyses see no difficulty in claiming a speedometer represents speed, despite speed\u2019s not doing separate causal work beyond the kinematics of the wheels.\n\nThe crux, then, is recognizing that representation depends on structural, nomic coupling, not impact by a sui generis medium. If lawful invariants link internal states with values of a magnitude, and those states are exploitable, we secure representation.\n\n7. ANTICIPATING COUNTER-ARGUMENTS\n\nCounter-argument 1: \u201cThe causal\u2010covariance view collapses representation into mere correlation; anything correlated would count.\u201d  \nReply: Dretske\u2019s and Millikan\u2019s consumer-oriented constraints prevent promiscuous correlation. Only correlations that are available to, and functionally recruited by, a consumer mechanism with a proper function confer representational status. The position of the pendulum\u2019s bob carries time information for a clock-reading subsystem; it does not carry that information for an unconnected rock.\n\nCounter-argument 2: \u201cIf all processes evolve in time, then every state trivially covaries with elapsed time; so the condition (i) is always met.\u201d  \nReply: The covariance requisite for information must be discriminating. To indicate t = 30 min rather than t = 25 min, the system must occupy distinct states only under those timing conditions. Most processes are not reliably periodic or robust; they dissipate, fluctuate, or depend sensitively on temperature. Only specially engineered or evolved oscillators exhibit the stability needed for functional timing. Thus the mapping from state to time is non-trivial.\n\nCounter-argument 3: \u201cBut the organism must still sense when to start the clock; otherwise there is no reference point.\u201d  \nReply: Indeed, timing systems include mechanisms for reset or phase locking. For circadian clocks, dawn light resets; for motor timing, a cortical signal marking \u201cgo\u201d starts accumulation. These triggers involve ordinary causal impact (e.g., photons on retinal ganglion cells). The critical issue, however, is that between start and stop, no further external causal interaction with time is required. The quasi-isolation of the timer during the interval eliminates the need for time to \u201cpush.\u201d\n\n8. IS THERE A DISTINCT SENSE MODALITY FOR TIME?\n\nWe can now return to the original question about a \u201cgenuine sensory system.\u201d Must every sensory modality begin with receptor cells opened to the world? One attractive proposal (Craig 2009; Chen et al. 2022) holds that interoception\u2014the perception of internal bodily states\u2014counts as sensory. Thermo-, chemo-, and mechanoreceptors inside the body feed signals to dedicated cortical areas. If clock mechanisms are likewise internal sensors of a bodily variable (phase angle of an oscillator), then we have a sense modality that is interoceptive. From this standpoint, time sense is akin to proprioception: one does not feel joint angles because \u201cjoint\u2010angle rays\u201d hit the skin; rather, muscle spindles signal stretch. The organism repackages an internal variable as environmental information (e.g., \u201cmy hand is two feet overhead\u201d). Similarly, the organism repackages oscillator phase as \u201c25 min have passed.\u201d The fact that the ultimate target of representation\u2014elapsed time\u2014is abstract rather than concretely located does not undermine its sensory bona fides.\n\n9. METAPHYSICAL REFLECTIONS: RELATIONAL TIME AND EARTHBOUND CLOCKS\n\nOne might worry that the foregoing story commits us to relational rather than substantival conceptions of time. Substantivalists treat time as an entity in its own right; relationalists hold that time is nothing over and above relations among events. Interestingly, the clock model is compatible with either metaphysics. Substantivalists can say: clocks detect their own dynamical evolution through absolute time; relationalists can say: clocks track relations among events (cycles) and therefore implicitly measure the temporal relations they help constitute. In neither case is time endowed with causal efficaciousness; causal work is done by mass-energy in motion. Hence, the representational story is neutral on deeper metaphysics of time.\n\n10. CONCLUSION: DEFANGING THE OBJECTION\n\nThe objection that there can be no sense of time because time lacks causal powers trades on a misunderstanding of how biological and artefactual systems carry information. Direct impact by the represented magnitude is not necessary. What is necessary is lawful, stable covariance between internal states and that magnitude, together with a consumer that exploits the correlation. Clocks\u2014whether pendular, quartz, molecular, or neural\u2014satisfy these conditions through endogenous oscillatory dynamics calibrated by occasional environmental cues. Accordingly, the brain can host legitimate temporal representations without the mediation of a special \u201ctime particle.\u201d The passage of time leaves its measurable trace not by exerting force but by being the dimension along which well-designed dynamical processes unfold. Philosophical scruples about causal impotence therefore do not prohibit a genuine sense of time; they merely remind us that sensing sometimes works via internal mechanisms that are harnessed, not hammered, by the world.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 10, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 3352, "reasoning_tokens": 256}
{"question_id": "Viera-SenseTime-2020", "question": "A common objection to the existence of a genuine sensory system for time holds that sensory systems gather information about the world through causal influence from the relevant environmental features on those systems (e.g., photons impacting the retina for vision).

How might one respond to this objection and explain how a clock mechanism could carry information about time without time itself causally influencing the mechanism?", "answer": "                                    Is There a \u201cSense\u201d of Time?\n                    Causal, Informational, and Mechanistic Considerations\n                    -------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n1.  Introduction: The Challenge in Its Strongest Form\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nEmpirical sensory systems, from vision to proprioception, are typically understood as causal interfaces between organism and environment.  Photons impinge on the retina, mechanical compression bends cochlear hair cells, and pressure deforms cutaneous receptors.  These proximal physical impacts transduce distal environmental structure\u2014light-scattering objects, vibrating strings\u2014into patterns of neural activity that the nervous system exploits.  A natural diagnostic, then, for whether *X* is a sense of *Y* runs as follows:\n\n   S can be a sense of Y only if Y exerts distinctive causal influence on S-receptors.\n\nTime seems to flunk this test.  Time, we are told, is \u201ccausally impotent.\u201d  It is not a fluid that strikes the skin, a particle that strikes the retina, nor a vibration that flexes cilia.  If nothing in the future exists, nothing now can be struck by it; if all instants are equally real, none need emanate a force.  However the metaphysics is filled in, the temporal dimension appears at best a stage on which causal relations obtain, not a player in those relations.  Hence: no causal contact, no sensory transduction, no genuine sense of time.\n\nYet organisms\u2014including ourselves\u2014plainly *do* register durations, rhythms, simultaneity, temporal order, the interval since an event, and so forth.  Clocks, both artificial and biological, track these facts quite reliably.  How can they do so if time\nitself is inert?  Can the objector\u2019s causal requirement be resisted\u2014or, alternatively, can we show that mechanisms obtain information about time even though time contributes no special causal \u201cpush\u201d?\n\nI shall argue that the objection stems from a mistaken conception of (i) what it is to carry *information* about a worldly feature, and (ii) what a physical *clock* is.  Once these concepts are clarified, it becomes apparent that a system can be a successful temporal indicator without time exerting any sui generis causal influence.  The argument proceeds in four steps.\n\n   1.  Distinguish *causal impact* from *nomological dependence* and show that the latter suffices for informational content.\n   2.  Analyse clocklike mechanisms as *self-evolving dynamical systems* whose successive states covary with temporal intervals in virtue of lawful regularities, not direct temporal \u201cforces.\u201d\n   3.  Exhibit biological and artefactual clocks whose operation fits this analysis.\n   4.  Defuse residual worries that without direct causal impact such systems encode merely correlations \u201cin the head\u201d and not genuine temporal properties.\n\nThe upshot is a principled rejoinder: the causal-impact criterion is too demanding, for sensory representation only requires reliable *law-grounded covariation* that an organism can exploit.\n\n\n2.  Information Without Causal Impingement\n------------------------------------------\n\nA foundational mistake in the causal-impact objection is to conflate *carrying information about* X with *being causally impacted by* X.  In Shannon\u2019s framework, a signal S *contains information* about variable X just in case the conditional probabilities P(X | S) differ from the prior P(X).  Causal contact is sufficient to establish such correlation but not necessary.\n\nConsider barometric pressure.  A column of mercury rises and falls with atmospheric pressure.  The atmosphere \u201cimpacts\u201d the mercury via transmitted forces, but atmospheric pressure itself is not a discrete cause; it is a higher-level state description of molecular motion.  Likewise, a sundial\u2019s gnomon casts a shadow whose length varies with the sun\u2019s apparent position.  What physically moves the shadow is the geometric projection of the sun\u2019s light, yet the dial\u2019s markings allow it to *carry information* about *solar time*.  The sun need not \u201ccause\u201d twelve-o-clockness; rather, given celestial mechanics, the shadow\u2019s direction at latitude \u03c6 at date d covaries lawfully with local solar time.  The underlying point generalises:\n\n   Information flows whenever dependable, law-sustained correlations exist\n   that can be harnessed by a consumer system, even if the target property\n   itself provides no extra causal shove.\n\nTherefore it is a necessary illusion of the causal-impact test that every represented property exert a microphysical force.  What matters is not *impact* but *reliable nomological coupling*.\n\n\n3.  What Makes a Mechanism a Clock?\n-----------------------------------\n\nA clock, broadly speaking, is any physical system that:\n\n   (i) undergoes a continuous sequence of state-changes governed by a law L\n   (ii) such that equal state-increments track equal temporal intervals\n   (iii) and that is readable by an agent or device to guide behaviour.\n\nPendulum clocks, quartz oscillators, circadian gene-expression loops, and the sequence of radioactive decays all satisfy (i)\u2013(iii).  None rely on a distinctive *temporal force*.  Rather, they instantiate dynamical laws whose solutions are functions of the independent variable *t*.  Because the laws are *time-translation invariant* (they look the same at each instant), the physical system \u201csweeps out\u201d states in a regular, predictable fashion; hence, its internal evolution embodies a metric of elapsed time.\n\nMore concretely, consider an idealised balance-wheel escapement.  At each release, the wheel\u2019s stored elastic energy converts into angular momentum and back, yielding oscillations at period T determined by mass m and torsion \u03ba, T = 2\u03c0\u221a(m/\u03ba).  The wheel\u2019s current angle \u03b8(t) = \u03b8\u2080 sin(2\u03c0t/T).  Thus \u03b8(t) is a deterministic function whose argument is the external parameter t.  Although no entity called \u201ctime\u201d strikes the wheel, the wheel\u2019s successive positions are *indexed by* time through L.  Reading \u03b8 allows an observer to infer t because, given L and initial conditions, there exists a one-one mapping f: \u03b8 \u2192 t mod T.  The *source* of the covariance is the system\u2019s internal dynamics plus background symmetries, not causal arrows emitted by time.\n\nThat difference is exactly paralleled in vision.  Brightness at the retina is a function of incident photon flux, which in turn is a function of distal surfaces, light sources, atmospheric scattering, etc.  Vision science therefore models *content* as inferred from a chain of lawful dependences.  We do not insist that \u201capplehood\u201d push on rods and cones; we are satisfied that lawful optical projections tie patterns of photon incidence to surfaces with high probability.  Temporal perception simply joins the same club: lawful dynamics tie patterns of internal clock states to durations.\n\n\n4.  The Roles of Calibration and Entrainment\n-------------------------------------------\n\nThe foregoing may provoke two further objections:\n\n   A.  Nomological dependence seems global and abstract; how does any *local* organism come to *know* the relevant law?\n   B.  Without anchoring to external events, a clock could drift; so what entitles an organism to treat its inner variable as measuring *objective* time?\n\nBoth objections are neutralised by the same phenomenon: *entrainment*.  Most clocks\u2014including laboratory chronometers\u2014are periodically corrected by external periodic markers: solar noon, a caesium atomic fountain\u2019s microwave absorption line, pulse trains from GPS satellites, social cues such as mealtimes.  These environmental patterns are themselves material processes with causal impact: photons from the sun alter retinal currents, social stimuli modulate dopamine release.  The organism learns or evolves to tune internal parameters (pendulum length, gene-expression rates) until its state-transitions synchronise to the exogenous marker.  Once entrained, subsequent internal ticks can accumulate reliably over shorter horizons in the absence of further external cueing.\n\nNote the subtlety: the external cue *does* exert causal influence, but it is not *time* influencing the clock; rather, it is *temporal regularities of other physical processes*\u2014sunlight intensity cycles\u2014that provide error-signals.  Calibration thus piggy-backs on ordinary sense modalities (vision, thermoception, magnetoreception) while leveraging dynamical laws to transform those calibrations into a locally available temporal coordinate.  The result is a division of labour:\n\n   \u2022 Standard senses supply intermittent temporal landmarks through physical contact.\n\n   \u2022 Intrinsic dynamics metabolise those landmarks into a continuously updated representation of elapsed time.\n\nHence biological timing is not mysterious; it is hybrid, stitched together from familiar causal interactions and endogenous lawful evolution.\n\n\n5.  Biological Examples\n-----------------------\n\na)  Circadian oscillators.  In cyanobacteria, the KaiABC protein complex cycles phosphorylation states with a period \u2248 24 h even in vitro.  The period arises from delayed negative feedback in phosphorylation kinetics; rate constants are temperature-compensated by evolutionary fine-tuning.  Light, mediated by chromophores, resets the phase each dawn; but after entrainment the protein ensemble free-runs.  The system therefore *encodes* circadian time because its biochemical state s(t) satisfies s(t + 24 h) \u2248 s(t).  No special temporal force is required.\n\nb)  Mammalian interval timing.  Striatal beat-frequency models propose cortical oscillators spanning a spectrum of frequencies.  A to-be-timed stimulus (tone onset) resets phases; a second stimulus (tone offset) triggers striatal neurons that detect the coincidence of oscillator-phases.  The coincidence vector constitutes a signature for the elapsed interval.  Pharmacological evidence shows that modulating dopaminergic gain dilates perceived duration in predictable ways, again indicating that temporal representation rides on neural dynamics.\n\nc)  Electric fish.  Mormyrid and gymnotiform fish emit periodic electric discharges and time the returning electrosensory reafference down to microseconds, enabling precise detection of prey.  The electric organ discharge (EOD) is generated by a central pattern generator; downstream neurons act as delay-line coincidence detectors.  Accurate time-of-arrival information is extracted solely from predictable phase relations within the fish\u2019s own pulses, not from any \u201cflow of time\u201d impacting receptors.\n\n\n6.  Objections and Replies\n--------------------------\n\n6.1  \u201cCorrelations Are Not Enough\u201d\n\nOne might worry that mere lawful covariance leaves open the sceptical possibility that the clock\u2019s reading is systematically off by a multiplicative constant or drift.  In practice, no sense modality guarantees veridicality in a vacuum; reliability is won by ecological embedding plus error-correction.  Vision can be fooled by illusions, olfaction by masking scents; yet we do not deny that these are genuine senses.  The same epistemic humility is appropriate for time perception.\n\n6.2  \u201cRepresentation Requires Causal Registration of the Represented Property\u201d\n\nThis objection misreads the naturalistic programme for representation.  Teleosemantic or informational views build content attribution out of selection history, use, and covariance, not direct causal contact with the property as such.  A neuron that fires for vertical bars \u201crepresents\u201d verticality even though verticality per se exerts no causal force; rather, light patterns typical of vertical edges do.  Mutatis mutandis for time.\n\n6.3  \u201cTime is Global; a Local System Cannot \u2018Read\u2019 It\u201d\n\nGlobality alone is no barrier.  Gravitational potential is likewise global, yet a local plumb line reveals it because local forces depend lawfully on the global distribution of mass.  Similarly, the dynamical laws that govern a pendulum implicitly encode temporal homogeneity; by obeying those laws, the pendulum becomes a locally accessible sign of a global parameter.\n\n6.4  \u201cBut What About the Metaphysics of Presentism vs Eternalism?\u201d\n\nIf only the present exists (presentism), then at any moment only the clock\u2019s current state exists.  Still, laws constrain which states can follow from which; counterfactual dependence suffices for the claim that the system *tracks* intervals.  If all times are equally real (eternalism), then the total world-history includes both clock states and the intervals they stand in.  Both metaphysical pictures deliver the same practical verdict: no exotic time-causation is necessary.\n\n\n7.  Reconciling the Causal Picture with the Sense Analogy\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nLet us return to the initial analogy with ordinary senses.  The causal-impact objection presumed the pattern:\n\n        Environmental property P  --(causal impact)-->  receptor state R  --(processing)-->  representation of P\n\nFor temporal perception, on the objector\u2019s view, the first arrow cannot exist.  The mistake is to think P must be the metaphysically thin predicate *being-t=\u03c4*.  What actually impacts receptors are *time-marked* environmental events: dawn light, vibrational cycles, or a mother\u2019s heartbeat.  Replace P with *dawn light flux*, and the causal story reinstates itself.  Then, through entrainment, organisms internalise a surrogate variable S (oscillation phase), which stands in reliable correlation with elapsed time t since dawn.  The revised schema is:\n\n   Environmental marker M\u03c4  --(causal impact)-->  receptor activation R\u03c4\n                                   \u2193 calibration/entrainment\n   Intrinsic oscillator state S(t) --(internal dynamics)-->  representation of duration \u0394t\n\nThe system has thereby bootstrap-ped a sense of time out of causal interaction with temporally patterned events, supplemented by lawful endogenous evolution.  No direct causal pathway from \u201ctime itself\u201d is needed; yet the representation is genuine and usable.\n\n\n8.  Wider Implications\n----------------------\n\nRecognising that clocks acquire temporal information through lawful self-evolution plus intermittent calibration dissolves a range of puzzles:\n\n   \u2022 In cognitive neuroscience, it explains why pharmacological agents that change intrinsic neural time-constants distort duration judgment.\n   \u2022 In robotics, it guides how to implement internal clocks that run stably on silicon oscillators yet are synchronised via Network Time Protocol packets.\n   \u2022 In philosophy of mind, it integrates temporal perception into the same naturalistic framework that already handles colour, pitch, and motion perception.\n\nMore speculatively, the analysis suggests that the human *phenomenology* of temporal flow may arise when the brain *reads* its own cascade of predictive-coding error signals, which unfold according to hierarchical time-constants.  The experienced \u201cnow\u201d could be a moving window generated by overlapping integration kernels.  Again, no ontologically robust flow is required; what matters are the lawful patterns of neural change.\n\n\n9.  Conclusion\n--------------\n\nThe objection that \u201ctime, being causally impotent, cannot be sensed\u201d trades on an overly literal and restrictive model of sensory transduction.  Once we distinguish causal impact from lawful covariance and appreciate that clocks are dynamical systems whose state-evolution embeds a temporal metric, the puzzle evaporates.  Mechanical pendulums, quartz crystals, gene-expression loops, cortical beat frequencies, and even drifting clouds of caesium atoms all \u201ckeep time\u201d not because time pushes them along but because the fundamental laws that govern their changes make explicit reference to an independent parameter that we\u2014as theorists\u2014call *t*.  By exploiting those regularities, organisms and artefacts alike harvest actionable information about durations and temporal order.\n\nIn short, there *is* a genuine sensory (or at least representational) system for time.  Its receptors are ordinary sensors; its special ingredient is dynamically self-referential machinery that transforms patterns of change into an internal temporal register.  The resulting informational link between mechanism and elapsed time does not violate, but rather exemplifies, the ordinary working of naturalistic representation.

The Objection Re-stated  \n\nA widespread picture of perception starts from a simple causal model. A sensory organ is a transducer: it converts energy from some environmental feature into neural signals. Photons strike retinas, airborne chemicals bind to olfactory receptors, air-pressure variations vibrate the basilar membrane. Because time is not a kind of particle, field, or pressure that can bombard an organ, it looks as though no analogous causal pathway exists by which \u201ctime itself\u201d could act on a sense organ. If the causal chain from environmental property to receptor is missing, then\u2014so the objection concludes\u2014there cannot be a genuine sense of time. We may have concepts of time or memories that order events, but nothing in us plays the role that the retina plays for vision.\n\nThe objection, in short:\n\nP1. Any genuine sensory system receives causal influence from exactly the external property it detects.  \nP2. Time, unlike light, heat, or pressure, is causally impotent; it never exerts forces on receptors.  \nC. Therefore there can be no sensory system dedicated to time.\n\nA neat syllogism. But its neatness depends on two controversial assumptions: (i) that information about X must reach a detector via a causal influence from X; and (ii) that time is the sort of thing that cannot causally influence anything. I shall attack both assumptions. Doing so will reveal why clock mechanisms\u2014and by extension biological time-keepers such as circadian systems\u2014can carry perfectly good information about temporal order and duration even though time never \u201cacts on\u201d them.\n\n2. Clarifying \u201chaving information\u201d  \n\nWe need a workable notion of what it is for a device to \u201ccarry information about\u201d some feature. Following Dretske and Shannon, let us say that a state S of a system carries information about a condition C just in case, in the circumstances of interest, there is a reliable (lawlike, nomic) correlation between S and C\u2014reliable enough that an agent could exploit S to learn about C. Crucially, reliable correlation does not always require a direct causal pathway from C to S. For example:\n\n\u2022 Atmospheric pressure differences cause the mercury column in a barometer to rise, but the height of the column also correlates with impending storms that have not yet reached the barometer. The column\u2019s height at noon can therefore inform a sailor about tomorrow\u2019s weather even though the future storm exerts no causal influence on the tube at noon.\n\n\u2022 A falling shadow on a sundial informs you of the time of day; the sun\u2019s position causes the shadow, but you might use that information to learn the time anywhere else on Earth that shares the same longitude\u2014even though those distant regions do not causally affect the stick and its shadow.\n\nThese cases show that causal mediation from *the property learned* to *the registering state* is not always necessary. What matters is counterfactual dependence: if the true value of C were different, S would\u2014as a matter of law\u2014tend to be different. From this starting point, the defender of a temporal sense can say: if there are internal states that vary in a law-governed way with how much time has elapsed, those states can legitimately carry information about temporal intervals.\n\n3. Strategy I: Reluctant Realism\u2014Time Does Enter Causal Relations\n\nOne straightforward response rejects premise P2. Contemporary physics treats time not as an inert backdrop but as a structural dimension that participates in dynamical laws. In general relativity, curvature in the space-time manifold and the distribution of mass-energy are mutually constraining: stress-energy tells spacetime how to curve, curvature tells matter how to move. More locally, every physical process is described by differential equations in which time appears as the parameter with respect to which change is defined. Thus time is implicated in *all* causal processes. To insist that it is entirely causally inert would be like saying that spatial relations are causally inert because \u201cbeing three metres east of the wall\u201d exerts no force. The spatial relation still figures essentially in explaining why your coffee cup is within arm\u2019s reach.\n\nOn this view, the escaping steam that drives a pendulum clock\u2019s escapement wheel is guided by temporal laws; the period of the pendulum is 2\u03c0\u221a(l/g) precisely because time is globally structured in a way that makes that dynamical law hold. Time, qua dimension, constrains the causal nexus and hence is not causally irrelevant. If one is willing to speak this way, then premise P2 collapses and P1 is satisfied: a clock\u2019s oscillatory element is indeed causally influenced by time because every event is. One could then happily dub the clock mechanism a \u201ctemporal receptor.\u201d\n\nCritics often complain that such talk reifies time. But we do not thereby posit time as an ethereal fluid pushing on gears. We merely note that temporally indexed laws link earlier configurations of a mechanism to later ones. If the laws hold, then the correlations between a pendulum\u2019s angle and elapsed seconds are not accidental; they are guaranteed by the deep structure of space-time. That is causal enough for epistemic purposes.\n\nStill, some philosophers remain uneasy. They prefer to reserve \u201ccausal influence\u201d for interactions mediated by forces or exchanges of energy. Even granting them that narrower usage, a second strategy shows why clocks can inform without \u201cinfluence.\u201d\n\n4. Strategy II: Self-Unfolding Processes and Calibration\n\nThe essential fact is simple: any sufficiently stable physical process that evolves monotonically provides an internal variable that can be *calibrated* to elapsed time. Consider a lump of radioactive cesium-137. Its decay is spontaneous; no external agency triggers each alpha emission. Yet we know its half-life. If I start with N\u2080 atoms and later count N atoms left, the ratio N/N\u2080 allows me to infer how many minutes have gone by, to remarkably high precision.\n\nImportant points:\n\na. The cesium sample\u2019s informational utility depends on its initialisation. If we do not know N\u2080, the count tells us little. Likewise, if a wristwatch is not set at noon, its dial later will mislead.\n\nb. No outside temporal signal needs to enter the sample. The information arises from an *intrinsic* dynamical regularity governed by natural law. A mechanism that measures a quantity that predictably changes with time can therefore be an *endogenous* time-keeper.\n\nc. Hence, the absence of a causal influx from \u201ctime\u201d is irrelevant. The world\u2019s lawful regularities supply the correlation; calibration makes it usable.\n\nWe can generalise. A minimal clock contains:\n\ni. A monotonic or periodic dynamical core (pendulum, quartz crystal, caesium hyperfine oscillation, metabolic gene loop).  \nii. A counting or integration stage that converts the core variable into discrete units.  \niii. A calibration link to agents\u2019 purposes (setting the hands or phase-shifting the circadian gene network using light cues).\n\nOnce set, the system\u2019s internal microcausality suffices: each tick causes the next tick, each suprachiasmatic nucleus depolarisation causes the next. As long as drift is within tolerance, the device tracks objective intervals.\n\nInformation here is carried endogenously, but it is still information because of an implicit counterfactual: had five minutes fewer elapsed, five fewer ticks (or a higher atom count) would now occur. The correlation is robust and exploitable whether or not \u201ctime particles\u201d beat against the crystal.\n\n5. Addressing P1 Directly: The Many-to-One Fallacy\n\nPremise P1 hides an illicit restriction. While photons indeed strike photoreceptors, not *every* sensed property is associated with its own proprietary causal pathway. Consider perception of *distance*. The early visual system receives a 2-D light pattern. Distance is not a distal causal source of further photons; what endows retinal disparity, convergence, motion parallax, and focus with depth information is geometry plus prior calibration. Spatial perception is extracted from correlations across multiple cues, none of which is \u201cdistance touching the retina.\u201d Similarly, perception of *number* (e.g., subitizing three flashes) uses duration or parallel neural firing; the property \u201cthree-ness\u201d does not stream into neurons.\n\nHence, even if one resists Strategy I, P1 is overly strict. Biological cognition constantly turns patterns whose causal origin lies elsewhere into content about novel, higher-order properties. Time is an extreme case: every physical change embeds temporal information, and organisms have evolved to extract it.\n\n6. The Teleosemantic Perspective\n\nTeleosemantics explains representational content in terms of a system\u2019s evolutionary or learning history of successful use. A frog\u2019s \u201cbug detector\u201d retinal circuit fires to small dark dots moving erratically. Evolution has selected it because such firings historically co-varied with protein-rich flies. The correlation suffices for content \u201cedible bug,\u201d though the feature causing spikes is a visual pattern.\n\nApply this to circadian oscillators. The gene network in a cyanobacterium cycles every ~24h. Its historical benefit lies in anticipating dawn: up-regulating photosynthetic proteins just before light arrives boosts fitness. The network\u2019s phase thus biologically *means* \u201cabout to be daytime\u201d even though the only immediate causes are internal phosphorylation events. What makes the state a representation of time-of-day is its selected function, not an influx of temporal photons. Teleosemantics therefore ably rebuts the causal-influent objection: representation is secured by historically reliable correlation plus use, not by a direct push from the represented property.\n\n7. Clocks in the Wild: Empirical Evidence\n\na. Plants whose leaves open at sunrise and close at dusk were once thought to respond instantly to light. But de Mairan (1729) showed that mimosa plants kept in constant darkness still maintained near-24-h cycles. Their internal oscillators are genuine time-keepers. Light cues act as *Zeitgeber*\u2014phase setters\u2014not as moment-to-moment drivers. The informational role of the circadian rhythm is independent of any continuous causal signal from the sun.\n\nb. Honey-bee foragers trained to arrive at a feeder every morning at 10:00 a.m. still turn up at \u201cbee ten\u201d inside climate-controlled laboratories. Their sense of elapsed time relies on metabolic and neurochemical processes, not on ongoing causal impact from environmental temporal features.\n\nc. In mammals, lesions to the suprachiasmatic nucleus abolish rhythmic anticipatory behaviour even under normal light\u2013dark cycles, showing that exogenous cues alone are insufficient. The internal oscillator is indispensable.\n\nThese cases underscore a moral: temporal information can be borne by self-sustaining dynamics. External cues merely synchronise them, much like you occasionally re-set a watch that otherwise runs on its own quartz oscillations.\n\n8. But What About Relativity and Frame Dependence?\n\nDoes the relativity of simultaneity undermine the possibility of tracking \u201creal time\u201d? Not practically. Any clock embedded in a given inertial frame measures that frame\u2019s proper time. When you and I synchronise watches on Earth, the shared rest frame ensures agreement within nanoseconds. If one clock were launched near light speed, its proper time would diverge, but each device would still accurately track its own world-line\u2019s temporal metric. Information is always relative to a reference frame, yet that does not preclude accuracy. Likewise, a barometer gives atmospheric pressure at its location, not some universal pressure.\n\nHence, relativity sharpens rather than sinks the account: what a clock represents is \u201cproper time along this world-line since calibration.\u201d The mechanism\u2019s internal dynamics (counting periods of a hyperfine cesium transition) match the invariant interval d\u03c4 in Minkowski space. There is no need for a causal messenger from an absolute temporal field.\n\n9. Objections Considered and Rebutted\n\nObjection A: Clocks merely *instantiate* time\u2014they do not *sense* it.  \nReply: The retina also instantiates light-absorbing chemistry; hearing relies on mechanical resonance. A physical instantiation becomes sensory only when coupled to downstream systems that exploit the signals for control, prediction, or belief. Human brains use wristwatch readings or internal circadian phase to schedule meetings; bees use metabolic cycles to time flower visits. That is precisely the exploitative coupling that turns a mere instantiation into a sensing system.\n\nObjection B: Clocks need external calibration, which ultimately relies on sun position or other causal temporal cues. So clocks do indirectly depend on causal influence from time.  \nReply: Calibration uses environmental *events* (sunrise), not \u201ctime itself.\u201d What flows during calibration is light or temperature\u2014the same sorts of causal mediators present in other senses. After calibration, the mechanism remains informative even without those mediators. If external cues were continuously required, mimosa plants in darkness would cease rhythmic motion, which empirically they do not for many cycles.\n\nObjection C: Internal oscillators drift; so they do not deliver genuine temporal knowledge.  \nReply: All senses are fallible: vision yields illusions, proprioception is imprecise, thermoreceptors desensitise. Fallibility does not preclude sense status. What matters is adequacy for the organism\u2019s needs. Quartz-watch drift of \u00b115 s/month is tolerable for daily life; circadian rhythms that gain or lose 20 min per cycle suffice for ecological tasks. When higher precision is needed, organisms and engineers supplement endogenous clocks with exogenous Zeitgebers (the Naval Observatory\u2019s time signal, dawn cueing in sparrows). The presence of such supplements confirms rather than denies that the internal mechanism is itself a time-keeper.\n\n10. The General Moral: Information via Lawlike Coordination\n\nWe can now crystallise the positive account. A mechanism M carries information about an environmental magnitude T (time) when:\n\n1. There is a nomic regularity R that functionally links states of M to values of T.  \n2. R is exploitable by some consumer system C (organism or agent) for guidance.  \n3. C\u2019s reliance on the linkage, through selection or learning, underwrites a representational function from M-states to T-values.\n\nFor clocks, R is grounded in physical laws of period or decay; for circadian genes, in biochemical feedback; for neural interval timers, in ramping membrane potentials. The objection\u2019s assumption that M must be *impinged on* by T confuses lawlike coordination with local causal transmission. When an organism or engineer designs a system that uses such coordination, the system qualifies as a sense\u2014an organised means of acquiring information\u2014even though the represented magnitude is not an active causal agent.\n\n11. Concluding Synthesis\n\nThe original objection claims: no causal impact, no sense. Against it we have marshalled four lines of response.\n\n1. Broad causality: Time participates in every dynamical law; in that sense it is never absent from causal chains.  \n2. Self-unfolding clocks: Endogenous dynamics yield lawful correlations with elapsed time; calibration makes them instruments of temporal knowledge.  \n3. Analogy to other derived senses: Depth, number, and impending storms are sensed via correlation, not by being causal impingements. Time is similar.  \n4. Teleosemantic vindication: What makes an internal oscillation *about* time is its selected or learned role in successful action, not the manner of its causal production.\n\nThe upshot is that the concept of a \u201csense of time\u201d is coherent and well-motivated. Whether instantiated in quartz, neurons, or gene networks, clock mechanisms do not need to be pushed by time particles. They need only embody reliable dynamical regularities that agents can exploit to predict, coordinate, and survive. Time, far from being disqualified by causal impotence, is omnipresent in the fabric of those regularities. That omnipresence is precisely what makes tracking it possible.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 12, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 3826, "reasoning_tokens": 448}
{"question_id": "Viera-SenseTime-2020", "question": "A common objection to the existence of a genuine sensory system for time holds that sensory systems gather information about the world through causal influence from the relevant environmental features on those systems (e.g., photons impacting the retina for vision). Since time is often considered causally impotent\u2014it cannot exert causal force on any mechanism\u2014there cannot be a sense of time. How might one respond to this objection and explain how a clock mechanism could carry information about time without time itself causally influencing the mechanism?", "answer": "I.\u2002Introduction: the alleged dilemma\n\nVision seems paradigmatic of a genuine sense because the distal feature that is sensed\u2014light\u2014literally impinges on the sensory organ. When photons strike retinal photoreceptors they trigger transduction cascades whose later neural stages subserve perceptual representation. Many philosophers (and some neuroscientists) have therefore claimed that any bona fide sense must be driven by a causal chain that begins with the property perceived. Time, however, appears disanalogous. Photons, pressure waves, odorant molecules and tastants are happily causal; \u201cthe passage of time,\u201d by contrast, is often described as causally impotent. If time itself cannot exert any force on a mechanism, then (so the argument continues) the claim that humans or other animals possess a \u201csense of time\u201d\u2014an inner clock, an interval\u2010timing system, etc.\u2014must be metaphorical. A clock, it is said, \u201ckeeps\u201d time only because its parts move in regular ways; nothing in the environment corresponding to time reaches out and makes the gears turn.\n\nThe objection has bite only if one endorses a very particular picture of (i) what it is to be a sensory system and (ii) what it is to carry information. I shall argue that both assumptions are too restrictive. A mechanism can lawfully carry information about temporal facts even though temporal facts, considered in abstraction, do not push on the mechanism. The moral is not merely that interval timing is philosophically respectable but that the causal theory of perception needs a more sophisticated account of informational mediation.\n\nMy strategy is threefold:\n\n1. Clarify how scientists and engineers succeed in building clocks that reliably encode temporal magnitudes without treating \u201ctime\u201d as an energetic stimulus.\n\n2. Show that the general informational relation exploited by clocks also underwrites biological timekeeping mechanisms, thereby motivating talk of a genuine \u201csense\u201d of time.\n\n3. Diagnose the initial objection as resting on a crude stimulus-response picture that ignores modern theories of representation, especially the distinction between physical influence and nomic covariance.\n\nThe result, I hope, is an account on which temporal representation is neither mysterious nor merely metaphorical, yet does not require time itself to be a causal agent.\n\nII.\u2002Two background clarifications\n\n1. Causation versus nomic dependence\n\nOne can be caused to acquire information in many ways. A storm siren that makes me believe a tornado is coming does so by a straightforward acoustic causal path. But sometimes I gain information because I understand a lawful correlation: seeing wet streets tells me it has rained even though the past rain no longer exerts any power. Fred Dretske\u2019s seminal work on natural information distinguishes the transmission of information from the exertion of force: a signal carries information if, given the prevailing laws, its obtaining would not occur unless the condition signaled also obtained. \u201cA red light on the porch\u201d carries information that the phone is ringing inside because, according to the wiring scheme, that lamp would be lit only if the phone were currently ringing; the lamp need not be vibrated by sound waves from the bell.\n\nThe same conceptual point surfaces in engineering. Instrument readings often track quantities that do not directly impinge on the read-out component. Consider a mercury thermometer. One is tempted to say that the mercury column rises because it is caused by heat\u2014a fluid emanating from objects\u2014but caloric fluid is a defunct theory. In contemporary physics, temperature is an average kinetic energy statistic. What directly pushes the mercury is molecular collision, not \u201ctemperature\u201d considered as a property over and above those collisions. Still, because there exists a stable nomic mapping between equilibrium volume of mercury and ambient temperature, the thermometer carries temperature information.\n\nIf we insist that the sensed property must itself act as an energetic stimulus on the receptor, we would have to deny that thermometers are temperature transducers. Something has gone wrong.\n\n2. What sensory systems do\n\nNeuroethology teaches that perceptual equipment exists to guide action by enabling organisms to extract usable regularities. Whether the extracted regularity is mediated by photons, molecules or merely the lawful evolution of an internal oscillator is of secondary importance. The crucial requirement is reliability under the conditions in which the organism evolved. Representational purism about the stimulus is biologically irrelevant.\n\nIII.\u2002How engineered clocks represent time\n\nStart with a simple pendulum clock. At t = 0 the pendulum is displaced and released; due to gravity it undergoes approximately isochronous oscillation with period T = 2\u03c0 \u221a(L/g). Each complete swing advances an escapement wheel by one tooth, turning the minute hand a fixed angle. What causes the pendulum to reverse direction? Gravity and inertia\u2014not time. Yet, given well-understood laws of motion and initial conditions, the number of completed oscillations after n periods is strictly correlated with how much time has elapsed. Someone able to inspect the wheel\u2019s position therefore gains temporal information.\n\nIn information-theoretic jargon the clock embodies a deterministic mapping f: physical_state \u2192 elapsed_time. Time therefore supervenes on, but does not force, the mechanism\u2019s state. No mysticism arises. The representation is secured by the nomic regularity that solutions of the pendulum\u2019s equation of motion unfold at a rate fixed by constants L and g. Energy from the descending weight compensates for friction; that energy is causal, but the flow of time is not.\n\nAtomic clocks provide a cleaner illustration. A cesium-133 atom has hyperfine energy levels separated by h\u00b79,192,631,770 Hz. Stimulated emission at that frequency drives a feedback circuit that counts cycles; 9,192,631,770 such oscillations define one SI second. Here the representational accuracy derives from the universality of quantum electrodynamics. The measured property is a transition frequency; \u201ctime\u201d plays no causal role. Nevertheless, after N detected cycles the circuitry correlates with an empirical fact: N/9,192,631,770 seconds have elapsed since an agreed-upon zero point. Practical success\u2014GPS synchronization at nanosecond precision\u2014confirms the soundness of treating the atom as an information source for time.\n\nIn both devices, then, a physical process of reliable period supplies a signal from which elapsed time can be decoded. Nothing in the design presupposes a metaphysically heavyweight \u201cflow\u201d that pushes the oscillator forward. The design presupposes only that physical laws are temporally homogeneous: if the same initial conditions are realized later, the same trajectory results. Temporal homogeneity is indispensable to physics anyway; denying it would undermine every empirical inquiry, not just clocks.\n\nIV.\u2002Biological clocks and the \u201csense\u201d of duration\n\nHumans and many other organisms display interval timing abilities across a vast range\u2014milliseconds for speech or echolocation, seconds for eye-blink conditioning, hours for circadian rhythms, even years in some migratory cycles. These phenomena are routinely investigated under the rubric of sensory neuroscience. Why, if the causal objection were correct, do scientists treat timing as a perceptual modality rather than a purely cognitive inference?\n\n1. Circadian sensors\n\nLight striking retinal ganglion cells entrains the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), but once entrained the SCN free-runs with a period of roughly 24.2 h. Molecular feedback loops of clock genes (Per, Cry, Bmal1 etc.) generate oscillations in protein expression; these oscillations drive downstream hormonal release and behavioral cycles. The absence of external cues (\u201cconstant dim light\u201d) reveals an endogenous clock. Again, temporal facts do not push the transcription-translation loop; biochemical kinetics under constant conditions suffice. Yet the resulting phase of the oscillation reliably indicates local time of day, enabling anticipatory behavior (e.g., melatonin secretion). The mechanism therefore functions as a biological information channel for time.\n\n2. Sub-second interval timing\n\nNeural \u201cpacemaker-accumulator\u201d models of temporal perception propose that a population of cortical or striatal neurons emits pulses at quasi-regular intervals; downstream circuitry counts pulses. Alternatively, \u201cstate-dependent network\u201d models posit that richly recurrent neural networks automatically evolve through high-dimensional state-space; at a given future moment t, the pattern of synaptic weights and membrane potentials uniquely reflects the elapsed interval since an initiating event. Experiments using optogenetics demonstrate causal sufficiency: artificially resetting striatal ramping activity resets rats\u2019 judgments of time. What provides the information is not time acting on neurons, but the deterministic trajectory of the neural system given its initial condition and biophysical constants.\n\nIn short, the animal \u201csense\u201d of time is sensorimotor in the same functional way as more traditional senses: it delivers information to guide action, exploiting lawful correlations between internal states and distal properties\u2014here, elapsed duration rather than color or pitch.\n\nV.\u2002Diagnosing the causal objection\n\nThe objection trades on an equivocation between two readings of \u201cinformation about X reaches the organism.\u201d\n\nA. Energetic influence reading (EI): X exerts a physical force that initiates a causal chain culminating in neural activation.\n\nB. Nomic covariance reading (NC): The organism possesses or is coupled to a process whose states are systematically mapped, via natural law, onto different values of X; by monitoring those states the organism can recover X.\n\nFor light, sound and odor both EI and NC obtain. For time only NC obtains, and that fact is misdiagnosed as a deficiency. But the mercury-thermometer example already shows that NC is sufficient for measurement. Conversely, EI without NC would be worthless: a flash of lightning shakes the house, but the trembling furniture does not thereby encode atmospheric charge distribution.\n\nWhy, then, has the EI intuition proven so resilient? Historically, empiricists like Locke and later Russell pictured perception as \u201cimpression\u201d on a passive surface; the causal story had to begin somewhere outside the perceiver. Anti-nativist worries about intentionality further cemented the idea that pre-existing causal contact is what confers content. Contemporary philosophy of perception has largely abandoned such simple empiricism in favor of more sophisticated teleosemantic or information-theoretic frameworks, but old habits linger.\n\nVI.\u2002Addressing two residual worries\n\n1. Epicycles of coincidence?\n\nOne might object that correlating internal oscillations with time is contingent; the mapping could drift. Granted. But the same is true for color vision: without photopigment regeneration cones would mis-report wavelengths. Biological systems maintain calibration through evolution and ongoing feedback. The SCN is daily re-entrained by light; sub-second timing adapts via dopaminergic prediction-error learning. Calibration mechanisms ensure that the nomic covariance condition remains satisfied.\n\n2. Is temporal representation parasitic on motion perception?\n\nSome critics argue that what clocks and brains really track are changes in non-temporal variables; time is but an abstraction imposed by theorists. However, complete reduction fails. Physical equations specify rates of change with respect to an independent parameter t. You cannot derive t from change alone because the same sequence of changes can occur at arbitrarily scaled speeds; without t you lack a metric. Internal pacemakers supply that metric. They therefore represent something over and above mere succession\u2014namely duration.\n\nVII.\u2002Relational versus substantival time\n\nPerhaps the deepest version of the causal objection relies on Newtonian substantivalism: if time is a universal container it has no causal powers, hence nothing can be caused by it. But if one adopts a Leibnizian or (more fashionably) a Rovellian relational conception, temporal facts are nothing over and above ordered relations amongst events. In that metaphysics the charge of causal impotence evaporates: to say the pendulum\u2019s twentieth oscillation is 40 seconds after the start is simply to relate two events via the structure of the dynamical law. Clocks then measure temporal relations directly, not a mysterious substance.\n\nVIII.\u2002Reformulating the sensory criterion\n\nA more adequate criterion for a genuine sense might be:\n\nS is a sensory modality for property \u03a6 in organism O iff\n\n(i) S contains a biological or engineered transduction mechanism M whose states vary reliably and lawfully as a function of \u03a6 under normal conditions;\n\n(ii) O exploits states of M to form representations that guide action adaptively;\n\n(iii) The reliability relation is maintained by evolutionary, developmental or learned calibration processes.\n\nCondition (i) does not require \u03a6 to impinge energetically on M; it requires only lawful variation. Timekeeping mechanisms satisfy all three clauses:\n\n(i) Pendulums, atomic resonances, gene feedback loops vary with elapsed time.\n\n(ii) Organisms and users read those states for action planning.\n\n(iii) Feedback entrainment or periodic resetting maintains reliability.\n\nHence time qualifies as a bona fide sensory target.\n\nIX.\u2002Conclusion: no causal mystery, no pseudo-sense\n\nThe initial objection rests on an overly narrow view of how information can reach a system. Clocks\u2014mechanical, atomic or neural\u2014do not need time to knock on their doors. They merely need to instantiate processes whose lawful evolution covaries with temporal parameters. Physical theories already guarantee such covariance by positing temporally homogeneous laws; biology exploits the same fact. Once the informational and functional criteria for perception are recognized, the putative causal impotence of time poses no threat. The sense of time is genuine, and its possibility is no more puzzling than that of a mercury thermometer or a barometer. What philosophy must abandon is the intuitive but untenable requirement that causal push must come from the very property represented.

How might one respond to this objection and explain how a clock mechanism could carry information about time without time itself causally influencing the mechanism?", "answer": "I. Introduction  \n\nMuch contemporary philosophy of perception builds on the idea that a genuine sense must be a causal channel through which distal features of the environment impress themselves on a creature.  When I see a red apple, wavelengths reflected from the apple strike my retina; when I hear a siren, pressure waves disturb my eardrum.  Because time, so the objection runs, has no analogous way of \u201cstriking\u201d us\u2014time does not collide with retinas or stretch eardrums\u2014there can be no literal sense of time.  A fortiori, there could be no time-detector analogous to a photoreceptor or cochlea, and no clock mechanism could count as a sensory organ.  Yet it is undeniable that clocks, biological as well as artefactual, carry remarkably precise information about how much time has elapsed.  How can that be, if time never causally acts on anything?  \n\nIn what follows I offer a multi-stage reply to the objection.  First, I argue that the objection presupposes an unduly narrow conception of what it takes for a system to carry information about an environmental variable.  Second, I introduce an information-theoretic account\u2014originally formulated by Fred Dretske\u2014on which a state of a mechanism carries information about a condition just in case, given suitable background laws, the occurrence of the state reduces the probability that the condition fails to obtain.  On that account, it is covariation under a nomic regularity, not direct causal production by the target property itself, that matters.  Third, I show how clock mechanisms, from swinging pendula to atomic oscillators to circadian gene networks, satisfy the information-theoretic condition vis-\u00e0-vis temporal intervals.  Finally, I draw a moral for the philosophy of perception: the absence of a dedicated receptor that time literally \u201cpushes\u201d does not entail the non-existence of temporal perception.  What matters is not whether time exerts force but whether organisms exploit lawful correlations between the passage of time and the states of internal or external processes.\n\nII. Clarifying the Objection  \n\nThe objection has two principal premises:\n\n1. Sensory systems gather information about X only if X causally influences those systems.  \n2. Time does not causally influence anything.  \nTherefore, no system gathers information about time; there is no sense of time.\n\nThe second premise is plausible under an orthodox metaphysics: time is not a substance that emits particles or fields.  But the first premise is more controversial.  Even paradigmatic senses do not always satisfy it if it is interpreted strictly.  Colour vision detects the reflectance profile of a surface, an abstract disposition that never literally travels through space.  What strikes the retina is merely a pattern of wavelengths; the reflectance property is inferred through the way that pattern covaries with illumination.  Sense organs often exploit \u201cinformational surrogates\u201d rather than the distal property itself.  The causal chain begins with photons, but the property we care about\u2014reflectance\u2014is a higher-level pattern that photons merely signify.  If visual perception can be mediated by surrogates, why should temporal perception be held to a stricter standard?\n\nOne might reply that in the colour case the surrogate (reflected light) is still produced by the distal property.  By contrast, nothing is produced by the passage of time.  But once again the distinction blurs.  Consider seeing a square.  Strictly speaking, what causally affects the retina is not squareness but an arrangement of brightness boundaries.  Squareness is a geometrical relation, not a causal agent.  The retina is never hit by \u201csquareness-particles.\u201d  Yet we treat shape perception as bona fide.  The causal chain originates in micro-events (photon absorption), but what the visual system recovers is an abstract relational structure.  The same strategy can work for time: a mechanism may be affected by micro-events whose statistical profile is lawfully constrained by how much time has elapsed, thereby allowing the system to recover an interval without being hit by \u201ctime-particles.\u201d\n\nIII. Information without Direct Causation  \n\nDretske\u2019s (1981) analysis of information provides the needed conceptual tool.  A state S of a system carries the information that condition C obtains (in context K) iff the probability of C given S and K is unity, whereas the probability of C without S is less than unity.  In slogan form: S is a reliable sign of C, given the laws that connect them.  Crucially, Dretske does not require that C cause S; it suffices that C and S be nomically correlated.  Indeed, his favourite example is a thermometer reading.  The mercury column\u2019s height is not caused by \u201ctemperature\u201d in the abstract; rather, temperature is a macro-level variable supervening on molecular kinetic energy, and pressure does causal work alongside temperature to set the column.  What matters is that, given the ideal gas law, a certain column height would not occur unless the temperature lay within a corresponding range.  Hence the column position carries information about temperature.\n\nApply the same template to clocks.  Let S be the current phase of the oscillator in a quartz watch.  Let C be the proposition \u201ct seconds have elapsed since the most recent noon.\u201d  The piezoelectric crystal oscillates at a rate fixed by its physical parameters; the counting circuit increments a register each time the crystal completes a cycle; the display converts the register value into a time reading.  Provided the oscillator is undisturbed, the truth of S entails the truth of C, because the laws governing the crystal guarantee a cycle time of 2.4 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2074 s.  The mechanism is a lawful correlational pipeline: oscillation phase \u2794 count \u2794 display.  The correlate of time is the number of cycles, which itself is not caused by time but by the dynamical laws that relate a crystal\u2019s physical state to its vibrational period.  Nevertheless, the display state is reliably informative about elapsed time.\n\nOnce the informational relationship is secured, two tasks remain.  First, explain why the mechanism is entitled to interpret S as indicating C (the \u201csemantic\u201d problem).  Second, show how the organism or user exploits that information.  Both tasks are unproblematic in the clock case: semantic content is fixed by the designer\u2019s intentions or by evolutionary teleology, and the user exploits the clock state to coordinate action.\n\nIV. Covariation Grounded in Dynamical Laws  \n\nLet us examine more concretely how clocks achieve covariation.\n\n1. Pendulum clocks.  The period T of a simple pendulum is 2\u03c0\u221a(L/g).  Given Earth\u2019s approximately constant gravitational acceleration, the length L fixes T.  Every half-swing advances the escapement by a tooth, moving the hands a small angle.  The causal chain is: gravitational torque on the bob \u2192 mechanical impulse on the escapement wheel \u2192 angular displacement of the minute hand.  Now pick any later state S\u2082 of the hand position.  Under normal operation, S\u2082 could not occur unless n periods had elapsed, i.e., unless time interval nT had passed.  Again, the passage of time does not push the hand; rather, gravitational and inertial forces working on a rigid system do, but the laws of motion make their effects a monotonic function of elapsed time.\n\n2. Quartz oscillators.  The crystal is cut so that an AC voltage induces mechanical deformation at a precise resonant frequency f.  The counting circuit divides down f to one pulse per second.  Because quantum-mechanical bonding forces determine f, and because those forces are stable under reasonable environmental variation, the pulse stream stands in a fixed ratio to physical time.  Perturbations such as temperature shifts can introduce drift; nevertheless, within tolerance the oscillator phase is nomically locked to elapsed time.\n\n3. Atomic clocks.  In a caesium clock, microwaves stimulate a hyperfine transition in caesium-133 atoms.  The resonance frequency 9,192,631,770 Hz is chosen as the definition of the second.  Here the covariation between cycles and time is not merely law-governed; it partially constitutes our unit of time.  Yet the same logic applies: the count of hyperfine cycles bears a one-to-one nomic relationship to elapsed time, all without time causing anything.\n\n4. Biological oscillators.  Cyanobacterial gene networks constitute a circadian clock.  Phosphorylation states of Kai proteins oscillate with an \u224824-h period because of coupled feedback loops.  Temperature compensation arises from kinetic parameters that adjust reaction rates to keep the period stable.  Although the causal work is molecular, the organism can rely on the phosphorylation phase to predict sunrise and tune behaviour.  Natural selection treats phosphorylation phase as an indicator of the external day\u2013night cycle, which itself is a temporal pattern.  Again, what the organism senses is not \u201ctime itself\u201d but the internal variable whose value depends lawfully on elapsed time.\n\nIn all these devices, the recurring theme is lawful covariation.  Systems governed by differential equations often have solutions that pick out a monotonic function of time (e.g., exponential decay in a radioactive nucleus, harmonic motion in a crystal lattice).  If a mechanism can latch onto that function and retain a stable mapping between its internal state and the independent variable t, it qualifies as a time-keeping system.  No extra metaphysical flow of time is required to drive it, any more than a slide rule requires numerical \u201cessences\u201d to move its sliders.\n\nV. The Causal Theory of Perception Revisited  \n\nA critic might concede that clocks carry information about time but deny that this constitutes perception.  Clocks, she might say, are merely measuring instruments external to the organism; even internal circadian oscillators operate \u201cunder the hood\u201d rather than being subjectively accessible.  Genuine perception requires a conscious phenomenology of duration or succession, which clocks lack.  \n\nWhile the phenomenological dimension is real, the objection reverses explanatory order.  If subjective temporal experience is to be more than magical, it must supervene on some physical information channel.  What else could ground my awareness that two seconds have passed between syllables?  Empirical psychophysics strongly supports the idea that dedicated timing circuits exist in the brain.  Striatal beat-frequency models, for instance, treat cortical oscillators as carrier signals; coincidence detection among them yields estimates of elapsed intervals in the hundreds of millisecond range\u2014precisely the range relevant to speech and music perception.  Functional MRI reveals oscillatory phase resetting in auditory cortex when participants listen to rhythmic sequences; disrupting the oscillations by transcranial stimulation impairs temporal discrimination.  The brain therefore appears to use the very same engineering principle as pendula and quartz crystals: a stable oscillator whose state covaries with time.\n\nNor is the presence of multi-modal calibration evidence against sensory status.  Vision depends on cross-calibration too: the visual system uses proprioception to correct eye position and vestibular signals to stabilise the visual scene.  If cross-modal dependence defeated sensory legitimacy, most of our senses would vanish.  By parity of reasoning, the neural circuits that track time may constitute a sense modality, albeit an atypical one\u2014call it chronoreception.\n\nVI. Does Time Cause Nothing at All?  \n\nSo far I have granted the premise that time is causally impotent.  But it is worth noting that not every metaphysics agrees.  On some conceptions, temporal facts\u2014e.g., that event e\u2081 is earlier than event e\u2082\u2014have causal consequences because they are built into the fundamental equations of motion.  The Lorentz force law, Newton\u2019s second law, Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s equation: all contain explicit time derivatives.  If e\u2081 had not taken place before e\u2082, the state at e\u2082 would differ.  That suggests a thin sense in which \u201ctime\u201d does play a role in causal explanation.  It is not an agent separate from the events, but it structures the dynamical evolution of physical systems.  Under that view, claiming that time cannot cause anything is like claiming that space cannot cause anything.  True, space does not shove objects around, but spatial relations figure in causal accounts: the Earth moves because gravitational forces depend on the inverse square of distance.  If space can enter causal laws without being a \u201cpusher,\u201d perhaps time can too.  In that looser sense, premise (2) is false, further weakening the objection.\n\nVII. Semantic and Teleological Completion  \n\nOne more step is necessary to convert lawful covariation into genuine representation.  Suppose a quartz watch sits unused in a drawer.  It still instantiates correlations with elapsed time, but no organism consults it.  Does it therefore \u201csense\u201d time?  Probably not.  Most philosophers agree that representation requires at least the potential for use in guiding action or thought.  A simple but serviceable account is Ruth Millikan\u2019s teleosemantics: a state of a device represents C if the proper function of that state, as selected by natural or artificial design, is to indicate C.  Clocks obviously satisfy the designer version; the circadian Kai oscillation satisfies the evolutionary version\u2014the reason that network was selected is precisely that it tracked the 24-hour cycle and enabled anticipatory metabolism.  Neural chronoreceptors likewise serve the function of coordinating movement, speech, and prediction.  Hence clock-like mechanisms do not merely correlate with time; they represent it in a normatively assessable manner (they can run slow or fast, they can \u201cbe wrong\u201d).\n\nVIII. Addressing Objections  \n\n1. Objection: The clock depends on spatial rather than temporal relations (e.g., number of oscillations), so it encodes \u201ccounts,\u201d not time.\n\nReply: Counts are numerals, but their mapping to elapsed time is built into the calibration convention.  A thermometer encodes height of mercury, yet we say it measures temperature.  Without a theory of error relative to the intended magnitude, one cannot demarcate instrument from mere artifact.  The error theory for a clock is explicitly temporal; a clock that loses 5 s per day is defective precisely relative to time, not counts.\n\n2. Objection: The mechanism presupposes time in its own operation; thus it cannot explain time perception without circularity.\n\nReply: Any measurement of a quantity employs processes that obey laws containing that very quantity.  Rulers presuppose spatial extension; thermometers presuppose molecular motion.  Such circularity is benign because we distinguish measured instance from measuring standard.  The atomic clock uses caesium oscillations as its standard; psychological time studies treat the standard as external chronometers.  Circularity threatens only if one demands an Archimedean point outside all temporal processes, a demand both unnecessary and incoherent given that empirical science must proceed within time.\n\n3. Objection: Perception involves distal interaction, whereas clocks detect only internal change.\n\nReply: Distality is a matter of which property is functionally targeted, not of immediate causal contact.  We see a distant mountain although the retina interacts only with photons; we feel the cold front arriving although only air molecules at our skin make contact.  The oscillation of a brain circuit targets elapsed interval, a property of the world\u2013organism system, not merely the circuit.\n\nIX. A Positive Account of Chronoreception  \n\nCombining the foregoing elements, we can sketch an account of what a sense of time would be.  A subject S possesses a chronoreceptive system if and only if:\n\na. There exists a set of internal states {\u03c3\u2081, \u03c3\u2082, \u2026} such that, in normal conditions N, the occurrence of \u03c3\u1d62 at t implies with high probability that an interval \u0394t = f(\u03c3\u1d62) has elapsed since reference event E.  \nb. The mapping f is grounded in nomic regularities governing a physical process P within S (oscillation, decay, drift, etc.).  \nc. The proper function of {\u03c3\u1d62}, as established by selection or learning, is to guide behaviour sensitive to temporal relations (coordination, prediction, sequence learning).  \nd. S can exploit \u03c3\u1d62 for voluntary or automatic control, and errors in \u03c3\u1d62 manifest as temporal misjudgements (e.g., gap detection thresholds, motor timing slips).\n\nHumans meet all four conditions.  Evidence ranges from the scalar property of interval timing (Weber-like variance proportional to mean duration) to the entrainment of neural gamma and theta rhythms by external flicker or metronomes.  Hence we do enjoy a specialised, though distributed, sense of time.\n\nX. Conclusion  \n\nThe original objection relies on a conflation: it assumes that if a property is not itself a causal agent, nothing can bear information about it.  The philosophy of measurement, supported by the information-theoretic approach, shows that this is false.  What is required is not direct causal influence by the property, but reliable, law-governed covariation that a system is designed or selected to exploit.  Clock mechanisms\u2014artificial and biological\u2014achieve precisely that for temporal intervals.  They exploit regular physical processes whose states map bijectively onto elapsed time.  The resulting informational link grounds both practical time-keeping and, at a more biological level, genuine perception of duration and succession.  Far from being excluded by the causal impotence of time, a sense of time emerges naturally once we widen our lens beyond brute causal \u201cpushes\u201d to the richer landscape of nomic correlation and functional representation.", "model": "openai/o3", "prompt_variant": "answer_without_rubric_2k", "sample_idx": 14, "is_human": false, "output_tokens": 4258, "reasoning_tokens": 576}
