Philosophers who defend some version of contemporary expressivism—whether in meta-ethics, aesthetics, or the theory of taste—have long sought purely linguistic phenomena that would vindicate their core thought that evaluative discourse is fundamentally different in kind from ordinary descriptive discourse.  The English verb “find” seems an ideal test case.

A familiar verbal tick of English speakers is the use of the psychological verb ‘find’ in sentences such as

  (1) Holmes finds saltimbocca tasty.  
  (2) Mary finds lying wrong.  

The construction is strikingly selective: it welcomes evaluative predicates—tasty, cruel, unfair, beautiful, funny—yet balks at purely descriptive ones—*vegetarian, made-of-pasta, triangular.

English contains a small but revealing class of “subjective-attitude verbs.”  The paradigmatic members are find, consider, regard, and a handful of experiential verbs such as taste or smell when they take sentential complements (“to me the soup tastes salty”).  Their complements must be evaluative:

• *Holmes finds Saltimbocca vegetarian / made of pasta.

Ever since A-J. Ayer and C. L. Stevenson introduced the idea that moral and aesthetic language functions more like a cry of approval than a statement of fact, expressivists have searched for purely linguistic evidence that evaluative discourse is non-cognitive—evidence that would show, in Paul Grice’s phrase, that “the word does the work.”  The English verb find looks tailor-made for that job.  In ordinary conversation we say things such as

In recent decades linguists and meta‐ethicists have looked to the micro-syntax of ordinary language for clues about the underlying nature of evaluative thought.  One construction that has attracted special attention is the English subjective-attitude verb find as it appears in sentences such as

During the last two decades moral and aesthetic expressivists have begun to mine ordinary language for evidence that evaluative discourse functions very much like the language of affect rather than the language of belief.  One construction that has drawn special attention is the “subjective-attitude” use of the verb find, exemplified by:

It behaves very differently from garden-variety propositional attitude verbs such as ‘believe’, ‘know’, or ‘suspect’.  In ‘Holmes finds Saltimbocca tasty’, or ‘She finds lying wrong’, the complement that follows ‘find’ must be evaluative – tasty, cruel, beautiful, wrong, amusing, rude, depressing, etc.  Attempts to embed straightforwardly descriptive predicates yi",openai/o3,answer_without_rubric_2k,6,False,openai/o3,5,6,5,6,5,6,33,2026-02-04T01:51:51.869246,15618,0,4119,640

The verb ‘find’ occupies an apparently humble corner of English grammar, yet its semantic and pragmatic profile touches directly on one of the central debates in meta-ethics and the philosophy of language: whether moral and other evaluative discourse is cognitive—representing how the world is—or non-cognitive, serving primarily to vent, guide, or register emotions and other pro-attitudes.  Expressivists have long urged that the key to understanding the peculiar logic of moral ",openai/o3,answer_without_rubric_2k,9,False,openai/o3,5,5,4,5,5,6,30,2026-02-04T01:51:51.869246,13218,0,3837,896

Expressivists about value hold that utterances such as ‘It is wrong to lie’ do not describe how the world stands, but give voice to a practical or affect-laden stance toward lying.  A persistent worry for this family of views is that ordinary language seems to treat evaluative sentences exactly like descriptive ones: both embed under truth-functional connectives, under belief reports, under epistemic modals, and so on.

Franzn-EvaluativeDiscourseAffective-2020,"The verb ‘find’ is a small, easily overlooked item of English vocabulary, yet its distribution points to a striking division in the kinds of mental states our language is built to talk about.

The surface grammar of English happily allows us to “find” an argument compelling, a meal delicious, a joke offensive, or a policy unjust; yet it balks when we try to “find” an object wooden or its molecular weight 180. These striking selectional restrictions would be merely grammatical curiosities were it not for the fact that they line up almost perfectly with the contrast that meta-ethicists, semanticists, and moral psychologists draw between evaluative and purely descripti",openai/o3,answer_without_rubric_2k,12,False,openai/o3,5,5,4,5,4,5,28,2026-02-04T01:51:51.869246,13775,0,3925,832

Since at least Ayer, expressivists have insisted that a sentence such as ‘Eating meat is wrong’ functions more like a boo-at-meat than like a descriptive report.  Within recent philosophy of language a small but telling piece of data has come to play an outsized role in this dispute: the behaviour of the subjective-attitude verb find.

In the familiar Newcomb problem the state of the opaque box is independent of your present bodily movements; consequently the causal decision theorist (CDT-er) discounts the evidential correlation between taking only the opaque box and finding it full.  “Death in Damascus” (first sketched by Gibbard & Harper and subsequently refined by Ahmed, Arntzenius, Gautier and others) presses a different worry.

Causal Decision Theory (CDT) enjoins an agent to rank her available acts by expected causal utility.  The standard gloss is that, for each act A, one considers every possible “state of the world” S that is not causally downstream of A, multiplies the value U(A,S) by the unconditional probability P(S), and sums.

GALLOW-CAUSALDECISIONTHEORISTS-2020,"1. Framing the issue

Causal Decision Theory (CDT) tells an agent to choose the act whose causal expected utility is greatest, where the expectations are taken with respect to unconditional probabilities for states that are not causally downstream of the act.

Causal Decision Theory (CDT) is usually advertised as a theory that tells us how to choose rationally when the consequences of our acts depend only on the causal up-shots of those acts.

Causal Decision Theory (CDT) says that rational agents should choose the available act that maximises causal expected utility.  Roughly,

EUCDT(A) = Σs P(s | **do**(A)) · U(A, s)

where A ranges over the acts under the agent’s control, s over “states of the world,” and P(s | do(A)) is the agent’s unconditional (‘causal’) probability that s obtains, i.e. the probability that s would obtain were A performed, holding fixed only what is causally upstream of A.

GALLOW-CAUSALDECISIONTHEORISTS-2020,"1. Introduction: the case and the worry

Causal Decision Theory (CDT) characterises the value of an act A as the sum of the utilities of possible states S weighted by the probabilities P(S│do A) that those states would obtain were A performed.  A central selling-point of CDT is that it tells the agent to ignore merely evidential correlations between her act and earlier, causally independent events.

GALLOW-CAUSALDECISIONTHEORISTS-2020,"1. Introduction  

Causal Decision Theory (CDT) was forged to avoid the counter-intuitive prescriptions of Evidential Decision Theory in Newcomb-type problems.  Its core principle is simple: when deciding, ignore mere evidence about what will happen and attend only to what your choice can causally influence.  The expected utility of an act A is therefore calculated with probabilities that are unconditional on A for any state S that is not causally downstream of A.

GALLOW-CAUSALDECISIONTHEORISTS-2020,"Causal Decision Theory (CDT) tells a deliberating agent to choose the act that maximises causal expected utility.  To calculate that figure, the agent is instructed to imagine performing the act by means of a “do‐operator” (an intervention that sets the act’s value), to hold fixed every variable that is not causally downstream of that intervention, and then to take an expectation with respect to the resulting probability distribution.

The Death in Damascus puzzle is purposely simple. The world contains only two salient variables.

GALLOW-CAUSALDECISIONTHEORISTS-2020,"1. Introduction  

Causal Decision Theory (CDT) is, at bottom, a recipe for selecting the act that maximises expected utility when the expectation is taken with respect to probabilities of outcomes that are not causally downstream of the act.  In ordinary choice situations this prescription appears both intuitive and stable: one attaches probabilities to states of the world, utilities to the possible consequence-pairs ⟨act, state⟩, computes each act’s expected utility, and picks the act with the",openai/o3,answer_without_rubric_2k,10,False,openai/o3,5,5,5,5,5,4,29,2026-02-04T01:51:51.869246,10978,0,2594,64

‘Death in Damascus’ (due to Gibbard & Harper 1978) is by now a familiar companion to Newcomb-type problems. You have two options, go to Aleppo or go to Damascus. Death, who is almost perfectly reliable, has already predicted which city you will choose and has positioned himself in that city.

GALLOW-CAUSALDECISIONTHEORISTS-2020,"1. Introduction

Causal Decision Theory (CDT) is usually praised for two related virtues.  First, it directs the agent to ask the question that seems most relevant to rational choice: “If I were to perform act A, what causal consequences would probably follow, and how valuable would they be?”  Secondly, it appears to escape the kinds of self– defeating feedback that beset purely evidential rules; by conditioning only on the counter-factual supposition that the act is performed, CDT is supposed t",openai/o3,answer_without_rubric_2k,12,False,openai/o3,5,6,6,5,5,6,33,2026-02-04T01:51:51.869246,15155,0,4490,1024
GALLOW-CAUSALDECISIONTHEORISTS-2020,"1. Framing the difficulty  

Causal Decision Theory (CDT) begins from a seemingly simple idea: when I am weighing acts, I should ask which act would causally bring about the best expected outcome.  Formally,

      EU(a) = Σs  P(s | do a) · U(outcome of a in s),

where the sum ranges over “states of the world” s that are not causally downstream of the act a.

Few doctrines in moral psychology have been as resilient—or as embattled—as the Kantian thought that an action’s worth depends on its being done “from duty.”  The view appears, on the one hand, to capture something exalted in ordinary moral admiration: we praise the person who keeps a painful promise because she must, not because she happens to relish doing so.

That a purely “de dicto” desire—“to do what is right, whatever that is”—could ground morally worthy action is a thesis with illustrious defenders and equally illustrious critics.

Epistemologists commonly distinguish between the having of reasons and the basing of a belief (or other attitude) on those reasons. One may possess evidence without forming any belief at all, or one may believe for reasons wholly unrelated to the evidence one possesses.

• Practical reasons: considerations that bear on the desirability, moral permissibility, or prudential value of holding the belief (e.g. “If I believe that my treatment will work, I will recover faster,” or “If I believe the racist pamphlet, serio",openai/o3,answer_without_rubric_2k,6,False,openai/o3,6,5,5,6,6,5,33,2026-02-04T01:51:51.869246,12238,0,2902,320

1.  The Causal-Influence Requirement

Philosophers of mind and perception often begin with a simple picture of sensory systems: they gather information by being causally impinged upon by the very features they represent.

That there could be something properly called a “sense of time” strikes many philosophers as suspect. Sensing, as we ordinarily understand it, involves an encounter with a worldly item that causally impinges on a receptor: light on retinas, air-borne chemicals on olfactory cilia, pressure waves on cochleae.

Viera-SenseTime-2020,"I. Introduction: the alleged dilemma

Vision seems paradigmatic of a genuine sense because the distal feature that is sensed—light—literally impinges on the sensory organ. When photons strike retinal photoreceptors they trigger transduction cascades whose later neural stages subserve perceptual representation. Many philosophers (and some neuroscientists) have therefore claimed that any bona fide sense must be driven by a causal chain that begins with the property perceived.

Much contemporary philosophy of perception builds on the idea that a genuine sense must be a causal channel through which distal features of the environment impress themselves on a creature.  When I see a red apple, wavelengths reflected from the apple strike my retina; when I hear a siren, pressure waves disturb my eardrum.

Human beings do not merely register the options before them; they adjust what they want to what they believe they can get.

When we utter a sentence of the form ‘A finds φ Adj’—for example, ‘Holmes finds Saltimbocca tasty’ or ‘She finds lying wrong’—we are attributing to the subject A a certain mental state toward the object φ.

The English verb “find” is semantically Janus-faced. In the construction “I found that the door was locked,” it functions like the propositional-attitude verb “discover” and attributes an epistemic state that can be vindicated or refuted by further evidence. In “I find coriander disgusting,” by contrast, no new piece of information could show me to be in error; at best it could train me out of the reaction.

The natural thought is that the verb find is semantically selective: it combines only with predicates that are themselves evaluative.

Why do speakers happily say ‘Holmes finds Saltimbocca tasty’ but recoil from ‘Holmes finds Saltimbocca vegetarian’?  A natural thought is that ‘find’ selects for a certain kind of mental state—roughly, the sort we express with ‘beautiful’, ‘tasty’, or ‘cruel’, but not the sort we express with ‘wooden’, ‘triangular’, or ‘Italian’.

For a decision theory to guide an agent, its prescriptions must be both stable and action-determining: having applied the theory, a rational agent must be able to settle on an option and act.

In the contemporary debate about moral motivation, two pictures compete.  
Picture A: The morally admirable agent is moved by the very considerations that make an act right—hurt is bad, promises create expectations, generosity relieves need, and so on. Here motivation is de re: the agent wants, of those actions, the ones that relieve need, keep promises, respect persons, etc.

Can a person who cares only about “doing the right thing” act with full moral worth, even when no more concrete sentiment—compassion, friendship, love of beauty—animates her? Common‐sense moral psychology says no: someone who pulls a child from a raging river because “that is what morality requires,” without an ounce of fellow‐feeling, strikes us as cold, even repellent.

The thought that moral worth requires more than a bare concern to “do the right thing” is intuitive and widespread.

Philosophers of science increasingly treat “objectivity” not as a single monolith but as a cluster-concept with several recognizable species: procedural, detached, interactive, convergent, and so on. Arthur Fine once suggested that what makes them all counts as “objectivity” is a common “attitude of trust.” Heather Douglas similarly writes that when scientists or laypersons praise a result as objective, they are implicitly saying: “you can trust it.” ",openai/o3,answer_with_rubric_2k,3,False,openai/o3,6,6,5,6,6,5,34,2026-02-04T02:00:04.212558,14392,0,3216,448

Does the very idea of a “sense of time” commit one to something metaphysically impossible—namely, to a sensory receptor that is acted on by time itself?  Critics think so.

Contemporary philosophy of perception often treats the senses as causal intermediaries between worldly properties and the perceiver.

Viera-SenseTime-2020,"I. Framing the Objection  

The objection can be sharpened like this:

P1 Sensory systems represent a property F only if F itself causally affects the system.  
P2 Time, unlike photons or sound waves, cannot causally impinge on a mechanism.  
C Therefore no genuine sensory system can represent time. Any appearance that we “sense” time is merely cognitive inference or memory, not sensation.

1. Setting the Problem

Viera-SenseTime-2020,"The “no-sense-of-time” objection trades on a simple syllogism:

1.     A genuine sensory system must be driven by causal influence from the environmental feature it detects.  
2.     Time exerts no causal influence on anything.  
∴    There can be no time-sense (and no mechanism—biological or artefactual—that really “detects” time).

What it attributes is an affective stance—roughly, a felt pro- or con-attunement toward an object or situation.

In epistemology we ask not only whether a person’s belief is true, but whether she has it for the right reasons.  A paradigm case is the mathematician who believes that 17 is prime because she ran through a proof; her belief is justified in a way that a lucky guess is not.  A central question is therefore the nature of the “basing relation”: what it is for a mental state S (say, believing that p) to be based on some epistemic reason R (say, the content of a proof of p).

Yet philosophers who have tried to cash out the term analytically have ended up with a bewildering list of species: mechanical, procedural, statistical, convergent, interactive, regulative, ontological, and more.  Arthur Fine and, more recently, Heather Douglas have offered an attractively simple unifier: in every register, to call a result objective is to say it can be trusted.

Koskinen-DefendingRiskAccount-2020,Scientific objectivity and public trust stand in a close but easily misstated relation.  Fine’s and Douglas’s slogan—“we call it objective when we can trust it”—captures an important sociological fact: scientists and laypersons alike invoke “objectivity” largely to signal that reliance is warranted.  Yet the aphorism threatens to collapse two conceptually distinct items.

Calls for “objectivity” in science are never merely semantic. Funding decisions, public policy, and everyday credibility hinge on that single word. Arthur Fine and Heather Douglas capture an important phenomenological fact when they say that to label some result objective is, in effect, to say it can be trusted.

Philosophers now speak freely of multiple “objectivities”: on one list we find procedural objectivity (strict adherence to standardized methods), convergent objectivity (robustness across different investigative routes), interactive objectivity (results stabilized through critical dialogue), and more.

1. The Puzzle  

We often say things like “You shouldn’t believe that conspiracy theory; there’s no evidence for it” (an epistemic rebuke) and “You ought not to believe the doctor’s rosy prognosis—if she’s wrong you’ll skip palliative care and suffer needlessly” (a practical rebuke).

Doxastic deliberation is ordinarily guided by epistemic reasons: considerations that bear on whether a proposition is true.

1. Introduction  

In debates over autonomy, no phenomenon is more vexing, morally urgent, and politically laden than the “adaptive preference.”  The term, first popularized by Jon Elster and later developed by Amartya Sen, Martha Nussbaum, Serene Khader and others, designates a systematic tendency of persons who lack attractive opportunities to revise their own desires so that what remains feasible now appears prefe",openai/o3,v2_tryhard_norubric,7,False,openai/o3,5,5,6,5,5,4,30,2026-02-04T02:15:06.732060,15741,0,3540,512

One of the central insights of contemporary moral and political philosophy is that people’s preferences are sometimes shaped by the very deprivations they face. The literatures on “sour grapes,” false consciousness, and internalized oppression all observe the same phenomenon: agents who lack meaningful opportunities come to want precisely what is available to them and to cease wanting what is beyond their reach.

Enoch-FalseConsciousnessLiberals-2020,"1. Introduction: Adaptive Preference and the Problem of Autonomy  

When Amartya Sen asked impoverished villagers in rural India about deprivation, many women replied that they had “no hunger problem.” What looked, from the outside, like resignation to grinding scarcity was registered by the women themselves as preference satisfaction.

Anyone who has taught Mill or Rawls knows the frequent, painful question: “What if a woman sincerely prefers a limited life behind the veil?” Cases in which agents appear to embrace life-plans that track oppressive norms—or merely bleak material constraints—give rise to the problem of adaptive preference.

Imagine a girl who grows up in a drought-ridden village where fetching water requires a four-hour walk each dawn. Asked whether she would like to attend secondary school, she shrugs and says she “doesn’t really care for books” and would far rather help her mother with domestic tasks.

Autonomous agency is commonly characterised by self-determination: an autonomous agent is one whose choices are, in some suitably robust sense, her own.

Since Gilbert Harman’s relativist conjectures and Allan Gibbard’s early work on expressivism, philosophers of language have taken an increasing interest in subtle grammatical phenomena that seem to separate evaluative from purely descriptive discourse.  One such phenomenon is the restrictive complementation profile of the English verb find when it is used in what linguists call its “evaluative” or “subjective-attitude” sense, as in

The semantics of attitude verbs has long been a testing ground for philosophical theories of mind and language. Suppose expressivists are right that ordinary evaluative discourse primarily serves to vent, register, or coordinate affective attitudes rather than to represent how the world is. If so, natural language ought to contain grammatical devices that track the difference between affective and purely cognitive states.

What kind of mental episode is ascribed when we say that Sherlock Holmes “finds” Saltimbocca tasty or that Mary “finds” lying wrong?  Ordinary English seems to contrast three broad kinds of attitude verb:

1. Epistemic or cognitive verbs (‘believe’, ‘think’, ‘know’, ‘discover’, ‘find that …’) which embed full propositions.

Much contemporary meta-ethics turns on whether evaluative discourse is fundamentally cognitive—aimed at representing how the world is—or non-cognitive—aimed at venting, regulating, or recommending attitudes.

During the last two decades linguists and philosophers have come to see “subjective attitude verbs’’ such as find, taste-words (tastes, smells, sounds), and look-constructions (looks red / looks delicious) as a fertile testing ground for theories of evaluative language.  An especially important observation is that English find only embeds a narrow class of predicates—the very predicates that intuitively carry a point of view: tasty, cruel, beautiful, offensive, boring, etc.  I",openai/o3,v2_tryhard_norubric,5,False,openai/o3,5,5,5,5,5,5,30,2026-02-04T02:15:06.732060,15377,0,4011,768
Franzn-EvaluativeDiscourseAffective-2020,"1. Introduction  

The expressive‐communicative profile of the English verb find, in the “subjective attitude” use illustrated by ‘Holmes finds Saltimbocca tasty’, has become a focal point in the philosophy of language because it seems to straddle two worlds. On the one hand it grammatically embeds a declarative clause, just as the purely cognitive attitude verb believe does; on the other, it is lexically restricted to evaluative and taste predicates and conspicuously resists purely descriptive ",openai/o3,v2_tryhard_norubric,6,False,openai/o3,5,5,4,5,4,5,28,2026-02-04T02:15:06.732060,13253,0,3602,832

Although the English verb “find” can be used in several ways (“Holmes found the clue under the rug,” “I find that she left early”), philosophers of language have recently focused on a distinct, “subjective‐attitude” use illustrated in (1).  

(1) a. Holmes finds Saltimbocca tasty.

A striking peculiarity of colloquial English is that the verb “find” comes in two quite different guises. In one use it is plainly cognitive and factive: “I found that the keys were under the newspaper” reports the discovery of a fact and presupposes that it is true.

Philosophers of language have long exploited the delicate interactions between particular verbs and the kinds of clauses they license as probes into the nature of the mental states those verbs attribute.

Within the philosophy of language the English verb “find” occupies a small but strategic corner.  In sentences such as

 (1)  Holmes finds saltimbocca tasty.  
 (2)  She finds lying (to be) wrong.

“find” does not mean “locate” or “discover”.  Instead it reports an attitude the subject takes toward the embedded property: Holmes has a positive gustatory response to saltimbocca; she has a negative moral response to lying.

One promising route for testing expressivism is to look not at the surface form of evaluative sentences themselves but at the verbs that canonically host them in ordinary English.  The attitude verb find is the clearest case.  Native speakers immediately hear a sharp contrast between

Among the verbs of English, the ‘subjective-attitude’ verb find occupies a strikingly idiosyncratic niche. In its “evaluative” sense (Holmes finds Saltimbocca tasty; She finds lying wrong) it will quite happily embed adjectives of taste, appearance, morality, aesthetic value, and the like, but it flat-out rejects ordinary, purely descriptive predicates (*Holmes finds Saltimbocca Italian; *She finds lying frequent).

For nearly half a century, the central dispute in epistemology has been over the nature of epistemic justification.

Epistemic evaluation—asking whether a belief is justified, warranted, or knowledge-conducive—turns crucially on the basing relation.

Every working scientist, journalist, policymaker and lay citizen routinely switches between talk of what is “objective” and what can be “trusted.” The terms seem almost interchangeable: a temperature reading produced by a calibrated thermometer is trusted because it is objective; a partisan blog post is distrusted because it is “only subjective.” Influential philosophers of science—Arthur Fine (1998) and Heather Douglas (2004",openai/o3,v2_tryhard_norubric,0,False,openai/o3,5,6,5,6,6,5,33,2026-02-04T02:15:06.732060,15895,0,3512,448
Koskinen-DefendingRiskAccount-2020,"Scientific inquiry is conducted by finite, fallible, historically situated human beings. Against that background the term “objective” functions as a powerful epistemic honorific: a result, a data set, a measurement protocol or a consensus that counts as objective is held to be exempt—at least to a useful degree—from the vagaries of individual preference, parochial perspective, or wishful thinking.

Few concepts in the philosophy of science attract more allegiance yet seem more elusive than “objectivity.”  To characterize a method, result, or institution as objective is to confer upon it a distinctive epistemic honorific; but as many meta-scientific taxonomies testify, the word comes in notably different flavors.

If what makes a bodily structure a sensory organ is that it is selectively sensitive to some distal feature—light, chemicals, pressure—through direct causal interaction, then the prospect of a “sense of time” looks dim.

Each of the familiar human senses is routinely described as a causal doorway through which the world imprints itself on the nervous system.

A standard empiricist picture of perception says:

Among the traditional five senses each has a clear physical channel that begins with a property that can literally act upon a transducer.

1. Introduction

Human beings can close their eyes, plug their ears, and still tell—often with surprising accuracy—whether a minute or an hour has passed.

1. Introduction: the target objection  
A venerable line of thought claims that there can be no strictly sensory system for time because sense organs gain information only when the relevant environmental property exerts a causal influence on them. Photons must strike the retina, sound waves must agitate the cochlea, odorant molecules must bind to olfactory receptors.

“When did you arrive?”  “How long will this take?”  Ordinary conversation is laced with questions whose answers presuppose that we are constantly keeping track of temporal facts.  Yet many philosophers and cognitive scientists insist that there is no literal “sense of time.”  The guiding thought is simple: perception requires a causal interface with what is perceived, and—unlike photons, pressure waves or odor-molecules—time exerts no causal pressure on the eye, ear or nose.

Viera-SenseTime-2020,"  Is there, or could there be, a genuine “sense of time”?  A standard argument for “No” proceeds in three steps:

1. Sensory systems work by being causally affected by the very feature they detect.  
2. Time, unlike light, pressure, or chemical concentration, is causally impotent; it does not buffet receptors or trigger transduction chains.  
3. Therefore nothing could ever be causally tuned to the presence of time, so there can be no temporal sense.

1.  Introduction  

At first glance, the objection looks decisive.  Our paradigmatic senses work because a feature “reaches out’’ and impinges on specialised receptors.  Photons strike photoreceptors, airborne chemicals bind to olfactory cilia, pressure waves deform cochlear hair-cells.  In each case the environmental magnitude plays an immediate causal role in triggering a chain of transduction that eventually yields a percept.
