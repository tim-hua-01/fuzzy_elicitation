Enoch-FalseConsciousnessLiberals-2020,"The paradox of the ""happy slave""—an individual who seemingly endorses their own subjugation—poses a formidable challenge to theories of autonomy. Adaptive preferences, where a person’s desires shift to match their limited or oppressive circumstances (e.g., a woman in a patriarchal society concluding she is unfit for leadership), intuitively represent a failure of autonomy. However, explaining *why* they fail requires distinguishing between structural compatibility and authentic agency. I argue t",openrouter/z-ai/glm-4.7,answer_with_rubric,0,False,openrouter/z-ai/glm-4.7,5,3,4,3,4,4,3,3,4,4,37,2026-02-02T17:19:03.462223
Franzn-EvaluativeDiscourseAffective-2020,"The thesis that ‘find’-constructions attribute non-cognitive, affective states is supported by the distinct grammatical and functional profile of these verbs, which aligns them with conative attitudes like disapproval or admiration rather than epistemic states like belief. The evidence rests on three pillars: the restrictive nature of syntactic embedding, the direction of fit between the mind and the world, and the constitutive role these states play in Moorean paradoxes.

GALLOW-CAUSALDECISIONTHEORISTS-2020,"The dependence on act probabilities in 'Death in Damascus' cases constitutes a decisive problem for Causal Decision Theory (CDT). This issue, known as ""dynamic instability,"" reveals that CDT fails to satisfy a fundamental requirement of a normative decision theory: the capacity to guide an agent to a stable, final decision. While CDT excels at evaluating actions from a detached, causal perspective, it collapses when applied to the lived process of deliberation, where the agent’s beliefs about th",openrouter/z-ai/glm-4.7,answer_with_rubric,0,False,openrouter/z-ai/glm-4.7,5,3,4,4,4,1,4,4,3,3,35,2026-02-02T17:19:03.462223
ISSEROW-MORALWORTH-2020,"The charge that acting solely from the motive of duty constitutes ""moral fetishism"" relies on a false dichotomy between the abstract and the concrete. I argue that acting from a de dicto desire to do what is morally right is not only sufficient for moral worth but is, in fact, the only motive that secures the unconditional reliability of moral action. Such dutiful action is praiseworthy precisely because it represents the triumph of rational agency over the contingencies of inclination, ensuring",openrouter/z-ai/glm-4.7,answer_with_rubric,0,False,openrouter/z-ai/glm-4.7,5,4,4,4,4,4,5,4,4,4,42,2026-02-02T17:19:03.462223
Jenkin-EpistemicRoleCore-2020,"The insistence that epistemic basing requires conscious awareness conflates the justification of a mental state with the subjective accessibility of that justification. I argue that lack of conscious awareness does not preclude a mental state from being epistemically based on reasons; rather, basing should be understood as a functional, causal integration between a mental state and its evidential ground, which can occur entirely outside the light of consciousness.

Koskinen-DefendingRiskAccount-2020,"The suggestion that scientific objectivity is grounded in trust, as advanced by Arthur Fine and Heather Douglas, captures an important sociological truth about the practice of science, but as a philosophical definition, it mistakes a consequence for a cause. While trust is undoubtedly a vital social correlate of scientific activity, it is not the constitutive element that unifies the various senses of objectivity. I argue that the relationship between objectivity and trust is merely contingent: ",openrouter/z-ai/glm-4.7,answer_with_rubric,0,False,openrouter/z-ai/glm-4.7,5,3,4,4,5,5,4,4,5,4,43,2026-02-02T17:19:03.462223
Maguire-GameBelief-2020,"The apparent incommensurability between epistemic and practical reasons stems from a category error: we treat them as competing forces on the same scale, when in fact they play structurally different roles in the architecture of rationality. I will argue that practical reasons do not weigh against epistemic reasons to produce a net verdict; rather, practical considerations determine the *threshold* of epistemic justification required for a belief to be permissible.

Smortchkova-SeeingGoalDirectedness-2020,"The claim that motor resonance is a necessary condition for perceiving goal-directed actions relies on an attractive intuition: to truly see an action as goal-directed, one must ""re-enact"" it within one's own motor system. However, I argue that this view conflates the *prediction* of action dynamics with the *perception* of action goals. Motor resonance is not necessary for the basic visual perception of goals; rather, it is a contingent mechanism that aids in prediction and social affiliation, ",openrouter/z-ai/glm-4.7,answer_with_rubric,0,False,openrouter/z-ai/glm-4.7,5,4,4,4,5,4,4,3,4,4,41,2026-02-02T17:19:03.462223
Viera-SenseTime-2020,"The objection to a sensory system for time relies on a reductive, ""billiard ball"" model of causation, assuming that for a system to carry information about a feature $F$, $F$ must physically impact that system like photons striking a retina. This premise is false. We can explain how a clock mechanism carries information about time without direct causal influence from ""time"" itself by distinguishing between *receptive* transduction and *generative* correlation.
