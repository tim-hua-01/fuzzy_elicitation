GALLOW-CAUSALDECISIONTHEORISTS-2020,"**Title: The Self-Referential Paradox in Causal Decision Theory and the Death in Damascus**  

**Thesis:** The dependence of Causal Decision Theory (CDT) on an agent’s subjective probabilities of performing acts in ""Death in Damascus""-style scenarios creates a self-referential paradox that undermines the theory’s practical adequacy and normative force. This issue arises because CDT’s expected utility calculations incorporate the agent’s credences about their own choices, leading to indeterminacy",openrouter/allenai/olmo-3.1-32b-think,answer_with_rubric_2k,0,False,openrouter/allenai/olmo-3.1-32b-think,5,6,5,5,4,5,30,2026-02-05T20:25:34.272176,12634,14589,,
GALLOW-CAUSALDECISIONTHEORISTS-2020,"### Thesis Clarity: 5  
The thesis is directly stated in the introduction and frames the analysis effectively, arguing that CDT’s sensitivity to act probabilities in scenarios like ""Death in Damascus"" constitutes a meaningful problem, though one with nuanced qualifications. The position is defended with textual evidence and contextualized within decision theory debates, providing a clear lens for evaluation.

### **Introduction**  
Philosophers have long debated the normative force of beliefs: what, if anything, compels us to hold a particular belief?

The interaction between epistemic and practical reasons in determining what one ought to believe is both inevitable and context-dependent.

The determination of what one *ought* to believe is governed by both epistemic reasons (concerning truth and evidence) and practical reasons (concerning consequences, such as harm or benefit).

#### I. Introduction: The Objection and Its Core Premises  
The objection in question asserts that a sensory system for time cannot exist because sensory systems, by their nature, rely on causal interactions with external objects or properties.

The objection to a sensory system for time—rooted in the claim that time’s causal impotence precludes its detection—is misguided.

In recent debates in the philosophy of language and evaluative discourse, the nature of evaluative expressions has been a central topic.

### Introduction  
The verb ""find"" in English exhibits a striking linguistic peculiarity: it readily combines with evaluative predicates (e.g., ""tasty,"" ""beautiful,"" ""wrong"") but resists pairing with purely descriptive ones (e.g., ""vegetarian,"" ""made of pasta"").
